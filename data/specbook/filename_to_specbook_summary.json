To accommodate warning messages, two buttons were relocated to the bottom bar.\n\n2. **Adjustment Instructions (Side Mirrors, Steering Wheel, HUD):**\n   - **Before:** The interface used arrows and visual elements (e.g., blue lines and circles) to indicate adjustments, which confused users. Some users mistakenly believed they could tap the arrows on the screen to make adjustments.\n   - **After:** Text-based instructions (e.g., \"Left,\" \"Right,\" \"Up,\" \"Down\") replaced the arrows, making the adjustments more intuitive. The updated design also removed unnecessary visual clutter, resulting in a cleaner interface.\n\n3. **Warning System:**\n   - **Before:** Warning messages were displayed in a strong red color, which appeared overly alarming and caused unnecessary concern. The warning icon often blended with the background, making it difficult to notice.\n   - **After:** The warning icon was made the focal point, with improved visibility and a more balanced color scheme. The overall design reduced the sense of urgency while maintaining clarity and proportionality to the severity of the warning.\n\n---\n\n### Action Items:\n- Verify if the updated UI designs have been tested with users to confirm improved usability and clarity.\n- Ensure that the relocated buttons (to the bottom bar) do not compromise accessibility or functionality.\n- Confirm that the updated warning system aligns with safety regulations and standards.\n\n---\n\n### Topics for Further Discussion:\n- Evaluate the potential need for multilingual text-based instructions for global markets.\n- Discuss whether additional training or user guides are required to familiarize users with the updated controls.\n- Review the impact of the relocated buttons on user interaction and overall ergonomics.\n\n",

The document details the system's requirements, configurations, input/output signals, detection capabilities, display logic, and fault handling. It also includes compliance with European regulations (EU 2019/2144 and 2021/1958) and provides tuning parameters for system optimization.\n\n---\n\n### Component/Part Details:\n\n#### **1. Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR):**\n- **Functionality:** Detects predefined traffic signs and sends information to the vehicle's CAN bus for display.\n- **Detection Capabilities:**\n  - Detects up to 10 traffic signs simultaneously.\n  - Recognizes fixed-pattern and electronic signs.\n  - Detects signs within a lateral distance of 20m (5.5m for \"No Entry\" signs).\n  - Operates at vehicle speeds between 0-150 km/h (minimum 60 km/h for \"No Entry\" signs).\n  - Detects up to 3 signs on a single pole.\n  - Works in both day and night conditions with proper illumination.\n  - Adjusts detection based on region codes (e.g., EU, US).\n\n#### **2. Intelligent Speed Alert (ISA):**\n- **Functionality:** Alerts the driver when the vehicle exceeds the detected speed limit using visual and acoustic warnings.\n- **Detection Sources:**\n  - Combines front camera and map data for speed limit detection.\n  - Follows a fusion strategy where camera data takes precedence for explicit signs, and map data is used for implicit signs.\n- **Alert Logic:**\n  - Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when the vehicle exceeds the speed limit by predefined thresholds.\n  - Alerts are inhibited under specific conditions (e.g., ISLC activation, braking).\n\n#### **3. Input Signals (Vehicle CAN):**\n- Signals include TSR mode selection, speed limit alert settings, trailer detection, ambient temperature, wiper status, and mileage units.\n- Examples:\n  - `0x354.MHU_TSR_Mode`: TSR mode (ON/OFF).\n  - `0x354.MHU_SET_TSR_SLAlert`: Speed limit alert thresholds.\n  - `0x235.TrailerDetected`: Trailer detection status.\n\n#### **4.

Display Logic:**\n- TSR can display up to 3 traffic signs simultaneously on the dashboard.\n- Signs are displayed within 2 seconds of detection or within 10m at speeds below 20 km/h.\n- Higher-priority signs override lower-priority ones.\n\n#### **6. Termination Logic:**\n- Speed limit and traffic sign information are terminated under specific conditions, such as:\n  - End of speed limit sign detection.\n  - Lane changes or vehicle turning.\n  - New higher-priority signs detected.\n\n#### **7. Fault Handling:**\n- Faults include camera failures, invalid signals, calibration issues, and CAN bus errors.\n- Examples:\n  - `Battery voltage too low/high fault.`\n  - `Invalid checksum or rolling counter faults.`\n  - `Out of calibration or NVM-related faults.`\n\n#### **8. Tuning Parameters:**\n- Parameters for optimizing detection and display distances.\n- Examples:\n  - `APV_Dis_keep_TSR`: Distance for displaying traffic sign information (default: 800m).\n  - `SLIF_PAP_MaxDist_And_Time_u16Dist`: Distance for displaying speed limit information based on speed ranges.\n\n#### **9. Compliance with Regulations:**\n- Adheres to EU regulations (2019/2144 and 2021/1958).\n- Includes Speed Limit Information Function (SLIF), Speed Limit Warning Function (SLWF), and Speed Control Function (SCF).\n\n---\n\n### Action Items:\n1.
