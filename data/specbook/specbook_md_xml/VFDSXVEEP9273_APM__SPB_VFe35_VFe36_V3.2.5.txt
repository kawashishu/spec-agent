1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.
This version is legally binding. This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard. Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g., what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English. All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.

- **Shall**: The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.
- **Should**: The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.
- **May**: The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

Safety Goal: Avoid pinching of extremities with higher forces than defined limits.

Attributes of the Safety Goal:
- Safe State: Window stays in position, goes into reverse, or opens mode.
- Warning Concept: Example: Error detection and warning for the driver to maintain a safe state.
- Degradation Concept/Emergency Operation:
  - If a failure occurs, auto-run mode will no longer be available until the failure is cleared (manual up and down control).
  - If a pinching situation occurs, auto-run mode will deactivate, requiring manual controls to reactivate.
  - Opening the window is always possible.

Example identifier: I-PWS-SG-01: Avoid pinching of extremities.

### 5.18 Parts marking  
Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations which have been defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<).

5.20 Mechanical Requirements.

5.20.1 Mechanical Energy Management.

5.20.1.1 Weight Targets.  
200g.  
Because the vehicle weight is a big influence on the energy consumption of the vehicle, the major goal of the weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight. Throughout the whole development, attention must be paid to a weight-optimized design of all components. All weight reduction potentials have to be shown by the supplier, along with their impact on cost, timing, and quality.

5.20.1.2 Fuel Consumption & Driving Performance.  
N/A.

5.20.2 Load.  

**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by MSF. The definition of customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.

**Special events:**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g. ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect function while no safety-relevant damages occur, and the intended service life will not be reduced.  

**Misuse events:**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g. curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned so that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g. steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g. easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or at neighboring components (principle “deformation before break”).

5.20.3 Vibration Behavior.  

**NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior:**  
The maximum vibration level is to be defined by the supplier (brackets must be developed to avoid resonances below a certain frequency).  
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 30Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with MSF.
</page>

<page number="44">
5.20 Mechanical Requirements.

5.20.4 NVH/Acoustic Performance. 
S&R, General.  
Noises perceived by customers as disturbing must be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and formations. The supplier must guarantee that components remain free from disturbing noises in their vehicle environment and geometrical integration. Similarly, no squeak or rattle noise due to excitation of the body (wind load, torsional flexing, etc.) should occur if relative movements on the surface are evident.  

This requirement applies over the fixed component service life under all operating and environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity. Evidence of disturbing noise freedom must be coordinated with the responsible testing team.

The supplier is responsible for supporting the development of vibration and acoustic behavior within the complete vehicle environment. This includes ensuring constant acoustic quality of delivered parts, actively identifying problems, proposing solutions, and delivering necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation free of charge.

5.21 Durability / Life Time. 
The lifetime mileage of the complete vehicle shall be at least 160,000 km, with a vehicle lifetime of at least 10 years.  

The environmental operating conditions include:  
- -40°C to +85°C ambient (Component Level).  
- 0 - 100% relative humidity.  
- -100 m to 3500 m above mean sea level.

5.22 Electrical Requirements  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations.

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.

Direct contact shall be avoided with more noble metals like steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Surface treatment on steel fasteners, which is long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials, must be used.

Electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.

**Terminals and connectors:**  
Terminals must not be placed at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement of tightness. Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.

**Groundings:**  
Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.

**Aluminium/sealing surfaces:**  
Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of >1% are highly sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal rapidly, leading to moisture entry.
