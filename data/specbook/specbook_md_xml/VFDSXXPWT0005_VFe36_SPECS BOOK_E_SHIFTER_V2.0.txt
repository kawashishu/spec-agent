2. Gear Shifter Function Description – to be determined (on-going).

1) Operation Mode Control:
   Based on vehicle conditions, the Gear Shifter operates in three modes: Initial, Normal, and Sleep states. Mode changes are dictated by CAN signals and hardwire IGN signal reception.

   - **Initial Mode**: Initializes the MCU for operation. Waits with backlight control until a valid gear state signal is received.
   - **Normal Mode**: Performs gear button detection/transmission, highlight/backlight illumination brightness control, and error control.
   - **Sleep Mode**: For low-power MCU operation, gear button detection/transmission and highlight/backlight illumination are not performed, allowing minimized dark current.

   Mode Table:
   | Mode         | Button Signal | Indicator Output       | Timer to Sleep |
   |--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|
   | Initial Mode | X             | O (Backlight Only)    | N/A            |
   | Normal Mode  | O             | O                    | N/A            |
   | Sleep Mode   | X             | X                    | N/A            |

2) Error Control:
   - **Gear Switch Contact Error Detection**:
     Detects contact error states for each button. Types of contact errors are described as follows:

Functional Responsibility:

1. **Gear switch chattering logic:**
   Gear switch chattering logic determines the state of switch contact and operates smoothly by considering:
   - T1: Switch chattering time under threshold.
   - T2: Switch chattering time over threshold.

2. **Gear button signal determination and transmission:**
   Button states are determined based on signal input and are transmitted via CAN.
   - P / R / N / D signal transmission.
   - Button signal transmission priority: P > N > D > R.

3. **Gear state highlight indicator output:**
   - Highlight indicator output is dependent on rheostat levels, with tunable brightness adjustments based on predefined duty values.
   
   **PWM Rheostat Level Input and Duty Output:**  
   - Input levels range from 0% to 100%.  
   - Highlight and backlight duty values increase based on rheostat level percentages.  
     Example:  
     - At 0%-30% input, brightness duty output is 30%.  
     - At 40%-60% input, brightness duty output increases to 60%.  
     - Beyond 70%, brightness duty output is 90%-100%.

4. **Gear state backlight indicator output:**
   - Backlight remains ON in Initial/Normal modes.
   - If no gear signal is received, backlight remains ON but highlight turns OFF.
   - Brightness is controlled via Rheostat level or PWM ILL+ signals.

5. **Gear Shifter Input/Output characteristics:**
   - **Gear Shifter Signal:** Includes signal levels that represent switch contact statuses such as:
     - SCB: Short Circuit Battery.
     - OFF: No connection.
     - ON: Active connection.
     - SCG: Short Circuit Ground.
     - Detailed voltage ranges:
       - Switch 1 (SCB: Over 4.9V, OFF: 4.4V-4.6V, ON: 2.6V-3V, SCG: <1V).
       - Switch 2 (SCB: Over 4.9V, OFF: 4V-4.2V, ON: 2.1V-2.5V, SCG: <1V).
       - Switch 3 (SCB: Over 4.9V, OFF: 3.4V-3.6V, ON: 1.6V-2V, SCG: <1V).

9 Supplier responsibilities  
The supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.  

### Customer service requirements  
**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

**Spare Parts Support Cycle**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall not be shorter than 10 years after VINFAST starts production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this Specs Book.  

**Maintenance Information of After-Sales Spare Parts**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).
