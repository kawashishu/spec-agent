3.2.1 System description.

The expansion tank is designed for use within the cooling system, featuring an upper member and a lower member, both constructed of plastic material and fixedly connected to form a unitary tank. This tank includes a coolant-receiving chamber and a coolant supply chamber. The design aims to minimize complexity and achieve high commonality between components.

The system designer must coordinate all components of the module in relation to packaging, function, fixing, and tolerances.

**BEV Coolant Circuit:**
The minimum coolant level in the expansion tank is required to be located at the topmost point of the system to ensure the circuit's optimal functioning. Additionally, the expansion tank must accommodate sufficient expansion volume to prevent the loss of coolant due to increased temperature or vaporization after shutdown.

Dimensions are determined based on ICE and BEV applications. However, the goal is to deliver a compact design while ensuring low overall cost and acceptable quality. The supplier is responsible for proposing the most cost-effective alternatives for each variant.

Single expansion tanks with different caps have been defined to support various vehicle programs.
</page>

<page number="8">
1. BEV application: The temperature of the coolant in the BEV E-drive and heating loops may range between -30°C and 95°C. Normal working temperature is below 90°C. The pressure may vary from -10 kPa to 50 kPa overpressure.

Cooling Expansion tank geometry shall be within CAD model boundaries (small deviations could be accepted). It must be self-contained (parts assembled within each other) and provide three mounting points (exact location to be confirmed). Suppliers should indicate the most cost-effective way to support both tank applications.

Expansion tank geometry should match with filling gun and off-the-shelf cap. 

Expansion tank caps will be different for both applications:
- Pressure release valve limit for ICE dagas tank – 1.5 bar.
- Pressure release valve limit for BEV dagas tank – 0.50 bar.

Expansion tank should also have a level sensor as an integrated part of the Expansion tank.

**BEV Expansion neck:**
The BEV Expansion neck is shown in the figure above. It contains detailed dimensional characteristics important for integration with the coolant filling gun.

**Coolant filling gun:**
A figure illustrates the design of the coolant filling gun for use with the BEV Expansion tank.

<page number="9">
3.2.2 Function.

The Expansion tank is part of a pressurized cooling system designed to push air bubbles upward and move out of the system. The Expansion system provides a volume for expansion of the coolant as it is heated as well as a means of de-aerating the coolant pressurized closed circuit. The Pressure Cap is used to maintain the pressure in the system. 

The Expansion tank is a functional subsystem designed to meet thermal management requirements, with each component requiring verification according to the following:

- The minimum coolant level in the Expansion tank must be located at the topmost part of the system to ensure the circuit works in the most effective manner.

- Expansion port should be located on the top side of the tank, while the output port will be positioned at the bottom side of the tank.

- The Expansion tank must provide enough expansion volume to prevent the loss of coolant due to increased temperature or vaporization following shutdown.

- To determine the expansion due to an increase in coolant temperature, a minimum of 2.3 liters total Expansion tank volume may be assumed.

- The size and design of the reservoir should be optimized to limit the flow rate and prevent aeration or air entering the system.
</page>

<page number="10">
3.2.3 System requirements.

As general experience on ICE applications one Expansion tank is used, but more than one can be used as per requirement. This is only a general interpretation of the layout that cooling module supplier must confirm.

The following requirements have to be fulfilled:
- Geometry.
- Acoustics, vibrations, resonances.
- Life due to the operational profile.
- Service and ease of repair.

Supplier is responsible for the Expansion tank development and to cover all development phases to ensure system performance requirements are met. Following development activities should be led by the supplier:
- Concept Creation system.
- Package refinement.
- Sizing of Expansion tank.
- Evaluates coolant flow distribution.
- Identification of leakage paths.
- Evaluation of pressure loss of cooling module.
- Evaluation of coolant flow uniformity.

The supplier provides flow rate data, which is used as a boundary condition for the cooling system simulation.

3.2.4 Interfaces.

The components must be designed in a way that functionality is guaranteed in combination with all the adjoining systems and interfaces.

Below is an overview of major interface points:
- Coolant Lines and Pump.
- BIW (clearances, packaging, resonances, stiffness).
- Engine.
- E-motor assembly and battery.
- Chassis (Clearances to Chassis components, e.g., fuel system, braking system, piping, etc.).
- Complete vehicle performance targets.
- Electrical connection.

The system is subject to ambient temperature variations, from -30°C to 100°C, and corrosive environments. The system is also expected to withstand all types of road load conditions, moderate violence caused during reckless driving on poor roads, or even under off-road conditions.

The most important interfaces are the tank fixation points, which use two top and two bottom pins fixation strategy. These interfaces influence the cooling module position and clearances with its surroundings. Moreover, they affect the NVH insulation place between the FEM and the cooling module. The interfaces in between should embody a more supportive character to improve durability, static and dynamic behavior, and tolerances stack-up.

6 Supplier responsibilities.  
The supplier is responsible to provide and ensure completion of the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

### Customer Service Requirements:

**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle:**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts must ensure life cycles of the project and meet the requirements in GTC after VINFAST completes the production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts:**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST's after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).
