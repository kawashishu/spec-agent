Connector – Electrical Connection  
The Body Control Module (BCM) connects to the LSM via LIN. Color Selection on the color wheel, Color Brightness, and Effects shall be selected by the user via the Human Machine Interface (HMI). The information shall be coded by the Multimedia Head Unit (MHU) and sent to the BCM via CAN. BCM shall receive the CAN messages and package the information into LIN format to the LSM individually. All wiring must meet VF Common Electrical Specification (CES). Refer to the latest release drawing for details and agreed Component Data Sheet (CDS), LIN Matrix, and LDF with VF E/E.

Target Effects  
Three lighting effects are available: Wave, Pulse, Morse.

Color Control via Color Wheel  
BCM sends information to LSM about RGB coordinates, and then colors illuminate based on the color selected by the user on the color wheel.

Brightness Control  
BCM sends information to LSM about brightness levels ranging from 0% to 100%.

Door Open Warning (DOW)  
The individual door ambient light can give a warning when a passenger or driver opens the door simultaneously with any vehicle approaching from the back. The warning is delivered via a red color pulse, and pulse rate or brightness increases to a maximum magnitude based on the distance of the vehicle. BCM receives signals from ADAS and sends them to the LSM. Detailed functional requirements are based on an agreement between BCM and ADAS. This feature utilizes existing Effects, Color Control, and Brightness Control programmed into the LSM.

Functional Responsibility  
Recycled Materials  
When selecting materials, attention should focus on reducing the variety of materials and ensuring compatibility with available recycling procedures, often referred to as "proven recycling technologies." Preference should be given to secondary raw materials such as post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics) based on their market availability. Recycled materials must be marked according to part marking standards outlined in this specification book and reported to the environmental compliance team at VinFast.

Recycling Scheme  
This section details the general project-wide requirements for recycling and repair schemes in component development.

- **Design for Recycling**: Parts and components must be designed to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
- **Recycling Process**: Contractors must provide a simple layout for the recycling process, including preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  
- **Submission Timeline**: The recycling scheme should be submitted to the environmental expert team at VinFast before the PTO (Production Try-Out) milestone.

Evaporative Emissions  
This aspect is not applicable.

Drainage and Depollution  
Complete drainage of fluids is mandatory to ensure safe and environmentally friendly end-of-life vehicle treatment. Fluid niches and pockets must be avoided for seamless removal.

- **Drainage Scheme Requirements**: Contractors must provide a drainage scheme, including virtual or physical test protocols. The information should specify:
  - Type of fluids drained
  - Amount in weight percentage
  - Absolute mass in kilograms

This information must be submitted to the VinFast environmental experts team before the PTO milestone.

Material Requirements & Corrosion  
Refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation for specific material and corrosion requirements.  

- **Corrosivity Classification**: The corrosivity position for each component must be determined as follows:
  1. **Corrosivity Low**: For components not affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
  2. **Corrosivity Medium**: For components moderately affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
  3. **High Corrosivity**: Default classification for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
</page>

<page number="18">
4. Very high corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations should be chosen to prevent galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and attached brackets. For critical material combinations, a proper coating such as paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers must be added. Drainage should be provided in the lowest positions to prevent water and dirt accumulation, and dirt traps must be avoided to prevent abrasive damage and painted body wear due to micro-movements. Contact surfaces to the body should be dry, large enough to ensure low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement. Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations.

Material combinations must be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Surface treatment on steel fasteners must be long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials. 

Electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion. Terminals and connectors should not be placed at the lowest points. Corrosion protection for terminals is primarily a tightness requirement, as electrical connections must be protected from humidity. Connecting surfaces for groundings must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment. 

Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of more than 1% should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Corrosion can penetrate seals very quickly, opening the seal for moisture ingress.

### Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts caused by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:
- Shielding parts should be provided for easily damageable areas.
- Enlarged radii for parts in high-risk areas can help prevent severe issues.
- In high-risk stone-hitting areas, use parts and paint materials of the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.
- Chromed styling elements on lower vehicle areas should be recessed to ensure they are not easily damaged by stones.

### Test Plan
The test plan specifies who will conduct the testing, the timeline, and the necessary testing devices. It also illustrates the results in a visually clear format and tracks testing progress. Control of test results must be ensured at all times. If verification of test results is requested by VinFast, the SDS must deliver the necessary parts free of charge.

The testing procedures and documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer at VinFast. The test plan must be updated weekly or as needed due to development changes.

The SDS bears full responsibility for safeguarding their components. Testing must be planned with sufficient lead time to allow approval or re-testing (in case of negative results) while adhering to the project schedule. The SDS must ensure VinFast receives all relevant test protocols and reports for verification.
</page>

<page number="21">
Testing responsibilities and procedure approvals:

VinFast reserves the right to attend any testing conducted at the supplier's site or their testing centers. Any deviations from the approved testing procedures require prior agreement between VinFast and the supplier (SDS). If tests are conducted with incorrect parts, missing components, or using a different testing procedure, the tests must be repeated at the supplier's expense. In situations where test results are unsatisfactory due to supplier-related failures, retesting must be planned and all associated costs borne by the supplier.  

**Required data for the DVP&R (Design Verification Plan & Report):**
- Declaration of the standard, norm, or legal requirement associated with testing.
- Detailed descriptions of how testing was conducted and a list of devices used (including pictures of the setup).
- Identification of the responsible test department.
- The location where the testing was executed (internal or external testing facility).
- Timeline and duration of the testing presented in the form of a project plan.
- Part variant and description details.
- Total number of components or parts tested.  

The DVP&R must be approved and agreed upon jointly by T&V (VinFast Testing and Validation), SQA (VinFast Supplier Quality Assurance), and the SDS prior to concept confirmation. Following confirmation, regular weekly reviews of the DVP&R are mandatory. Any schedule delays require the supplier to propose alternative measures to ensure compliance with the committed timelines. Upon request, the supplier must provide a test plan for each individual component.  

**Failure Analysis and Responsibilities:**

In the case of a failure during testing conducted by VinFast, a root cause analysis will be performed. If the failure is attributed to the supplier, the supplier will bear full responsibility for resolving the issue, while VinFast will provide support to close the matter. Suppliers are encouraged to attend centralized testing as needed.  

### 3.3 General CAE Requirements  
Projects must align with document: **VFSRXXCVC0201 VFCAE-001-FEM-GENERAL_Analysis requirement.**

### 3.4 Material Requirement  
Components and assemblies must be designed to facilitate economical recycling at the end of the vehicle's life cycle. Suppliers are responsible for preparing a recycling concept. Only pre-approved materials, as per the European automobile industry's standards, may be used for each specific application.

### 3.5 Traceability  
All parts must comply with the traceability specifications set in **VinFast standard VFDST00010501**.

### 3.6 Labeling of Parts  
Suppliers must adhere to **VinFast standard VFDST00000010** for part labeling. The supplier is required to provide figures demonstrating the positioning of labels on parts, including images illustrating the label setup.

### 12. Appearance Approval Process

The **Appearance Approval Report (AAR)** is mandatory for suppliers providing components that affect CMF appearance. These components require VinFast Approval prior to PPAP deliverables.  

The AAR verifies that VinFast Design Quality has inspected the final product and confirms it meets all required appearance specifications. A harmony review ensures that the component quality or state is homogeneous with adjacent parts.  

Design Quality requires all suppliers to submit non-commercial value sample parts. Suppliers must provide complete assembly parts, classified as purchase parts (P-level), and child parts, classified as component parts (D-level).  

Refer to **VFDST00038401** for detailed quantity requirements and submission guidelines.
