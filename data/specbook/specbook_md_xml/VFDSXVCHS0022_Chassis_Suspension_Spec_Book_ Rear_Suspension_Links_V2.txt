11 Production Quality.

11.1 In-Process Testing.
In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuing improvement. Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan. When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked.

The table that follows summarises the various IP tests and the acceptance parameters for each. They form the basis on which to develop a complete Control Plan for these and their related significant process characteristics. The Control Plan will include frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.

**Table of Tests**  
Refer to DVP for all tests:  
- Material Test  
- Environmental Test  
- Component / System Level Testing  

11.2 Visual Inspection.
All parts will be 100% inspected in the formed condition, after heat treatment, and after machining at the time of packing. No surface defects (cracks, notches, malformed areas, etc.) are allowed. These allowable surface defect standards should be made available to the appropriate inspectors and operators at the various manufacturing facilities. The following applies to all surfaces unless otherwise noted.

11.3 Dimensional Control.
The production supplier has the ultimate responsibility to write the Control Plan and to identify significant characteristics (SC) over and above the significant and critical (SC, CC/) features identified by VinFast. The production supplier is also responsible for establishing initial Process Control and ongoing process capability reporting per VinFast requirements.

The Control Plan will identify those features requiring process capability. Process capability must be established from 30 pieces randomly selected from a continuous production run of at least 300 pieces. The process capability must meet AIAG PPAP edition 4. Capability data is to be included in the PPAP documentation.

When process capability has been demonstrated, X-bar and R charts must be used for ongoing control of characteristics identified in the Control Plan unless specifically waived by VinFast ATI1. Acceptance of parts by any sampling plan or statistical process control procedure does not relieve the supplier of their responsibility that each part meets all requirements of the purchase order and the components print.

If any defects are found during implementation of the in-process sampling plan, the supplier must invoke the reaction plan program specified in the Control Plan. Individual VinFast ATI1 departmental requirements for acceptability of process capability numbers (Cp, Cpk, etc.) may supersede any general guidelines at any time.

Figure 1 provides an example of standard identification marking.

12.2 Semifinished Pipes and Sheet Metal.
Materials must adhere to component drawings or technical delivery specifications in the parts list of the assembly drawing. The requirements as per the standards listed in the drawing or the supplier's technical delivery specifications apply to semi-finished pipes and sheet metal, provided no restrictions are noted according to the drawing or in this standard.

The requirements are particularly interpreted in the context of further use as function-critical chassis components. Verification of compliance for all component parts must be provided by means of a test report as per DIN EN 10 204.

12.3 Surface.

12.3.1 Surface Condition.
Component parts must be further processed to be free of burrs (≤ 0.3 mm as per DIN ISO 13715) and without chips. Requirements as defined in subsection 2.5.3 apply to the rear axle carrier assembly (prior to paint finishing). Tool-related markings or defects are permitted up to a depth of 0.3 mm. Minimum wall thicknesses must not fall below threshold values, and functionality cannot be impaired.

12.3.2 Surface Treatment.

12.3.2.1 Requirements.
General requirements include adherence to VFDST00003500 for pretreatment and cathodic dip painting of steel components. Continuous processing time of the components must align with the total processing time in the pre-treatment and painting unit. Subdivision of processing time is prohibited due to risk of basic material corrosion. Suitable measures are required if storage time impacts process adherence, and verification must be documented.

**Surface state before coating:**  
After pretreatment processes, there must be no residues (e.g., branded oils or lubricants) on the surface that negatively affect subsequent processes. Checks may be performed in accordance with ASTM standards (water breaking test). Scaling and impurities around welding seams or heat-affected zones must be removed to allow an all-over phosphate layer formation.

**Phosphating:**  
A phosphate coating must be applied as follows:
- **Coating weight:** 5 ±3 g/m².
- **Inside, external surfaces, welding seams:** Immersion is mandatory for hollow profiles.

Thick-layer cathodic dip painting requires edge optimization and coating must follow specifications in drawings.

**Coating Thickness:**
| **Surface** | **Minimum** | **Target Value** | **Maximum** |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Outside      | 35 μm       | 40 μm            | 50 μm       |
| Inside       | 20 μm       | -                | -           |
| Edges        | 8 μm        | -                | -           |

The maximum applies to bolting areas marked in drawings. Minimum paint coat thickness at edges must be verified. Burrs must adhere to VDI guideline 2906 sheet 1 and sheet 2. E-coating contact points must be hidden in the assembly and defective areas avoided.

**E-Coating Drying:**  
Drying requires an object temperature of 165 °C (minimum) and a 15-minute duration, with maximums outlined at 200 °C and 10 minutes. The e-coating paint must be fully cured. Specific details are available in e-coating supplier baking window documentation.
