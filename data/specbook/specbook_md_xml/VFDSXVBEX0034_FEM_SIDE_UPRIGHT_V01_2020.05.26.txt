5 Description and scope of work.

5.1 Technical requirement.

Materials.
Material and production-compliant design layout of the components should avoid production-related surface flaws/defects such as tool parting points/lines, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, and stress zones. Components must have material-compliant fits, curvatures, corners, allowing visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces. Edges, corners, and ribs must be designed to run uniformly with proportional and material-compliant accuracy. Selection of concepts and production methods should facilitate homogeneous structures and grain patterns. Burrs in the visual and haptic zones must be eliminated, and materials must pair correctly.

Surfaces should be free of disturbing noise in contact with the environment under all temperatures and driving conditions. All surfaces need to comply with DINENISO 1302 standards. The quality of production materials supplied must meet “VFDST00055300” standards. Suppliers must coordinate the form and surface with samples, including Cubing reports and Appearance Approval reports (referencing VFDST00038400 Color Matching/Appearance Approval and VDA 280 part 1). These samples must be presented to VinFast approval offices at specified times. Matching parts must also be prepared by the supplier, which must be coordinated through the matching department.

Variants.
Only one variant applies to all vehicles.

Interfaces.
Parts packages should be configured to include considerations for all tolerances impacting component parts and assemblies, such as body, cooling packs, front axle carriers, bumper beams, front bumpers, and heat insulation. Components must be designed to maintain functionality in combination with all adjoining systems and interfaces.

Performance Specification.

NVH and Driving Comfort.
The VINFAST target system for the Front End Module (GOR) is based on reference vehicles. The Front End Module system (GOR) structure should prevent visible vibrations and mode shapes across the full speed range from 0 km/h to Vmax. Both engine and aerodynamic excitations must be incorporated when considering structural stiffness. Burrs resulting from manufacturing processes on subcomponents that impact aero-acoustics must be eliminated unless specifically approved by a function specialist. All fixation elements (e.g., bolts, clips, rivets) are required to be airtight, subject to approvals from the function specialist.
</page>

<page number="12">
Component must be mechanically stable up to the highest possible speed range. No deformation of the component is allowed. Flat surfaces must be supported by an appropriate stiffening structure underneath. The component must remain stable over its lifetime, with no deformation or shrinkage due to temperature, moisture, dirt, or UV radiation. Glues must maintain specified adhesion levels.

The supplier must ensure that components are free of disturbing noises within their vehicle environment. The system must not produce any type of disturbing noise, such as relative movement noise, wind noise, squeaks, or rattles, under any operating condition, including temperature variations or torsional flexing.

## Vehicle Safety
The supplier is responsible for actively supporting the integration of vehicle safety functions. Laws and lifetime ratings of the selling markets (Vietnam) and OEM requirements must be accounted for.

### Specific Demands
- Development of deformation characteristics to support pedestrian protection.
- Up to five local module load cases will be defined by VinFast (VF).
- Example of module load case: deformation X-resistance between specified KN span in a defined YZ position.
- UN-R21 pendulum device with specific mass/speed shall act as the impactor; VF will provide detailed impact energy specifications.

### General Demands
- Vehicle safety functions must be prepared to the maximum on a system level using expertise, CAE, and testing.
- Supplier data relevant to the project must be handed over to VF upon request, free of charge.
- Performances must meet target requirements with spread effects confirmed via an adequate number of worst results from identical test series.
- CAE models for parts/systems must be provided on demand, developed in LsDyna, and validated as numerically and physically stable.
- FE meshes should be homogeneous with a density of 8–10 mm, aligned according to the part’s axes/geometry. Non-compliant meshes must be reworked.
- Suppliers must generate validated CAE material cards by conducting system-level and component-level tests. Suppliers are responsible for planning, executing, and financing these activities.
- Test matrices defined by the supplier must align with full vehicle timing demands. Before higher-scaled tests (sled or vehicle crash tests) are performed, supplier optimization test series must be completed.
- Supplier-specific parts required for testing activities in any project phase must be provided free of charge to relevant testing facilities.

<page number="13">
Component must be mechanically stable up to the highest possible speed range. No deformation of the component is allowed. Flat surfaces must be supported by appropriate stiffening structure underneath.  

The component must be stable over its lifetime. No deformation or shrinkage due to temperature, moisture, dirt, or UV radiation is allowed. Adhesion properties of glues must also remain intact as specified.

The supplier has to guarantee that their components are free of disturbing noises within the vehicle environment. The system must not cause any disturbances such as relative movement, wind noise, squeaks, rattling, or any noise associated with temperature or torsional flexing during operation.

### Vehicle Safety
The supplier is responsible for actively supporting the integration of vehicle safety functions. Lifetime-relevant laws and rating standards for selling markets such as Vietnam must be adhered to alongside OEM requirements.

#### Specific Demands
- Support pedestrian protection through the development of deformation characteristics.
- Up to 5 local module load cases will be defined by VinFast.
- One example of these module load cases could include the deformation X-resistance between KN-span in a specific YZ position.
- As an impactor, an UN-R21 pendulum device with a specified mass and speed shall be used; further details of impact energy will be provided by VinFast.

#### General Demands
- Vehicle safety functions must be prepared on a system level using expertise, CAE, and testing.
- Supplier data must be provided to VinFast upon request and free of charge.
- Fulfillment of performance targets with spread effects must be secured with a sufficient number of test results.
- Part/system CAE models must be provided upon demand to support vehicle data freeze milestones, validated and realized in LsDyna.
- FE meshes must adhere to guidelines; rework is required for non-compliant meshes.

### Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability)
- Ensure sufficient operational strength for intended vehicle operational conditions (loads and special events).
- Verify product-specific characteristics derived from application profiles.
- Establish requirements ensuring operational strength for complete vehicles, subsystems, and components, which serve as the baseline for all technical specifications.
- Mounting force must always be lower than dismounting force.

#### Operating Loads
Operating loads are derived from benchmarking base vehicles on VinFast-defined tracks. These loads represent typical conditions during vehicle use. The tested mileage correlates with the intended customer usage target of 160,000 km.
</page>

<page number="14">
## Special Events:
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle (e.g., ABS-braking). The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect its function, ensuring no safety-relevant damages occur and maintaining the intended service life.

## Weight Management:
Because vehicle weight significantly influences energy consumption, the major goal of weight management is to minimize total vehicle weight. Throughout development, attention must be paid to weight-optimized designs for all components. Suppliers must identify weight reduction potentials and demonstrate their impact on cost, timing, and quality.

## Vehicle Dynamics and Fuel System Integration:
The Front End Module openings must meet functional requirements for brake cooling as defined by Heat Management & Powertrain Cooling, Aerodynamics, and Chassis Module. These requirements are aligned and verified during Styling Technique Convergence meetings.

## Test Plan:
The test plan specifies who performs testing, when it occurs, required testing devices, and displays results visually. Continuous testing result control is mandatory. If VinFast requires verification of tests, the SDS must provide necessary parts free of charge.

### Test Procedures and Documentation:
- Test procedures and documentation must be approved by VF’s validation and component lead engineers.
- The test plan must be updated weekly or upon development changes.
- SDS is responsible for safeguarding complete approval of its components. They must plan testing timely to ensure approval and address negative test results on committed schedules.
- VinFast must receive all testing protocols/reports for verification during SDS site testing or SDS testing center visits. Any approved testing process deviation must be agreed upon by VinFast and SDS.

### Testing Revisions:
- Wrong/missing parts or different procedures necessitate redo testing, borne by SDS costs.
- Negative test results require retests, with costs borne by SDS if they caused failures.

### Required Test Plan Data (DVP&R):
- Testing declarations (standard, norms, legal requirements).
- Detailed testing procedure descriptions, including set-up visuals (pictures).
</page>

---

#### General Testing Guidelines:
1. SDS prepares a detailed testing plan aligned with the vehicle timing chart (refer to Chapter 4.17).
2. SDS must ensure testing of the worst-case component/system variants.
3. SDS combines mechanical and electrical tests where feasible to prevent redundancy.
4. Development and partial body structures required for testing must be pre-noted in quotes from the SDS and ordered from VF by the SDS.
5. Measurement reports for sample parts must be included in delivery unless expressly agreed otherwise.
6. Parts required for VF test department activities must be provided free of charge by the SDS.
7. Component developers must ensure compliance with relevant legislation and VF performance specifications.
8. Test results must be fully documented, including photos, and delivered to VF.
9. SDS must meet all Vietnamese legal obligations.

12. The attached DVP&R template must include all test results as an enclosure to SDS offers.
</page>

<page number="16">
Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (as coordinated with the test department). Even manual samples can provide sufficient information in certain cases. This allows measures to be introduced in time to address any assembly problems and ensure the installability of the test parts.

VinFast "Logistics" determines the required number of sample parts, while VinFast "Purchasing" orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed with the delivery.

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS must always be listed in the SDS quotation and ordered by VinFast. The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to the DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be conducted by the SDS.

CAD data models must comply with VinFast requirements and be provided in time for virtual sample manufacturing. To coordinate the form and the surface, corresponding samples must be presented by the SDS to the appropriate approval offices at VinFast, accompanied by a Cubing report and Appearance Approval report (according to VF Standard VFDST00038400). 

Matching parts must be provided by the SDS free of charge (measured and marked per VinFast Standards). 

Key standards for SDS compliance:
- **Marking of sample parts:** Per VF Standard VFDST00008700.
- **Measurement report preparation:** Per VF Standard VFDST00008900.
- **Evaluation system of parts:** Per VF Standard VFDST00008300 (applied to sample parts).
- **Reference point systems:** Per VF Standard VFDST00000011.

### Release by Test Departments
The responsible VF test department will release components only if all test targets agreed upon by the SDS are achieved, including their performance during full vehicle integration tests. The SDS must submit positive test reports for all required tests according to the DVP&R. In the case of any issues (negative test results, incorrect parameters, or processes), an updated test report must be submitted by the SDS, and solutions proposed to adhere to milestones and targets. 

The following must be stated within the SDS test reports:
- **Test outcome:** Clearly marked as "OK" or "NOK" on the first sheet.
</page>

<page number="17">
### Analyses and Test-Reports
The SDS must provide measurement reports (VFDST00008900) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during prototype generations. After individual tests, test samples must be analyzed in detail.

The measurement and test results must be proven through individual values and documented in a test report. The report is required to be submitted to the responsible VF department for release. Upon request, the results along with the documentation of tests conducted during initial sample inspections and those performed parallel to development must be provided to the responsible specialist department for release. Tests conducted during series production must be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.

---

### Test-Report/Information

- **Comparison details:** Results must be compared with the specification book, testing guidelines, and legal requirements.
- **Recommendations:** Includes suggestions and required corrective measures.
- **Negative test results:** A further approach or corrective actions must be described when results are negative.
- **Testing status tracking:** Lists all tests in a table format indicating responsible persons, part status, comparison of target and due dates. Negative test results necessitate a new schedule for re-testing, coordinated with VF approval and responsible persons/companies listed.

---

### Periodic Updates
The VF test engineer must be periodically updated on actual status and progress. If VinFast orders parts for testing, a detailed description of these parts must be attached.

---

### Archival Storage of Tested Parts
Tested parts must be appropriately archived and stored as per VinFast standards.
</page>

<page number="18">
Testing parts are only allowed to be scrapped if VinFast test department agrees to this. On demand of the test engineer, the complete testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.

### BIW-supports, testing devices, and equipment:
- The number and configuration of BIW-supports are to be aligned with the testing department. The BIW supports are provided by VinFast for the testing period.
- The number and structures for testing (e.g., vibration testing devices, environmental testing devices, and long-term run structures) are to be aligned with the testing department.
- SDS must provide evidence that all equipment for testing adheres to the corresponding instructions.

5.3 Material Requirement & Corrosion.  
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC ("VinFast").  

**For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:**

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
   
2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

**Additional Information:**  
The vehicle Exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.  
Material combinations should be selected to ensure that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. For critical material combinations, proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  

Avoid water and dirt accumulation by always providing drainage in the lowest positions.  
Dirt traps where sand may act as an abrasive and damage the painted body through micro-movements should also be avoided.  

Contact surfaces with the body should remain dry, sufficiently large to enable low pressure, and should consist of non-abrasive materials. Micro-movement should be minimized.  

Ensure burr-free edges and utilize a paint system designed for strong edge coverage.

- Groundings must have water-tight connecting surfaces if placed in corrosive environments.

**Aluminium/sealing surfaces:**
- Aluminium alloys containing copper and iron content above 1% should be avoided for sealing surface components. Corrosion in such alloys may penetrate the seal quickly, allowing moisture to enter.

**Prevention of stone chipping issues:**
Details not provided within this section.
</page>

<page number="23">
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:

- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone impact risk, choose part materials and paint with the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges that point in the vehicle’s driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle, embed them deeper to reduce the likelihood of stone impact.
