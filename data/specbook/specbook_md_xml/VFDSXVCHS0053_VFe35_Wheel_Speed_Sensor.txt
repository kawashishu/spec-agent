## 3.2.4 Function

### Intended use
The use of WSS is restricted to earth bounded vehicles, engines, or machines. This document comprises all specifications and tests for the WSS (without dynamic line testing) as a component of the brake system, for example:
- The Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS)
- The Traction Control system (ASR)
- The Electronic Stability Control system (ESC)

The WSS is only meant for the mentioned applications above. For defects and damages caused by other applications or usage in ambient and application conditions which are not defined in this specification, all contractual requirements are deemed fulfilled when the product successfully passes the tests in accordance with the TCD and agreed documents.

It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure the proper application of the product in the vehicle.

The intended use of the WSS is to support HAD functionality. This drives a requirement for a redundant WSS that has a dual sensing head.

### Misuse
Any usage of the WSS other than earth bounded vehicles, engines, or machines is not allowed. Any usage not following the specifications and conditions described within this document is strictly prohibited, for example usage in:
- Aircrafts or light aircrafts
- Jets
- Military applications
- Underwater operations

The proper function of the WSS is guaranteed only when operated with appropriate ECU and system components. Misuse of the WSS may lead to critical and unexpected system behavior such as unwanted brake interventions.

The Wheel Speed Sensor is designed to generate speed pulse signals induced by the rotating target wheel in an appropriate air gap. Non-application relevant or incompatible use/test cases are accordingly not covered by this specification. Examples of prohibited actions include:
- Increasing the magnetic air gap during the standstill phase of the target wheel, causing a reduction in magnetic flux density in the sensor elements by more than 50%.
- Lowering the magnetic field strength from one pole to another by more than 50%.

Such actions may lead the sensor to signal standstill pulses if programmed as I- or V-protocol types, or maintain its current signal level if programmed as S-protocol—even if the target wheel starts rotating again.

Disassembly and reintegration of the sensor are not permitted under any circumstances.

### Interface

#### Sensor Head  
**WSS installation constraints:**  
- Installation bore diameter + tolerance (tight fit/loose fit).  
- Installation bore entry chamfer (relevant for in-bearing types).  
- Installation bore roughness (relevant for in-bearing types).  
- Installation bore depth.  
- Press in force for sensor mounting.  
- Dimension and material definition for mounting flange for WSS.  
- Tightness requirement for O-ring application.  

#### Cable Assembly  
**Chassis interface/application:**  
- Grommet interface definition.  
- Clip interface definition (installation hole dimensions).  
- Grommet/clip mounting force.  
- Colored stripes on cable.  
- Tube dimension.  
- Tolerance chain for mounting at OEM-side.  

**First grommet/clip to sensor head:**  
- Minimum distance and radius.  

**Cable dynamic area:**  
- No components allowed in dynamic area.  
- Minimum radius and maximum bending/torsion distance.  
- Maximum twisting angle of the cable after installation.  

#### Connector/Plug  
- Connector interface drawing and connector performance specification.  
- Pin coating (coating material and thickness).  
- Definition of fixation force (pull stress).  
- Mechanical connector coding.  

### Definition Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS)  
The WSS consists of the following parts:  
- **Sensor head**  
- **Cable harness:** Harness with 4 or more conductors (Redundant), including grommets, mounting elements, and a connector in accordance with the application.

<page number="11">
Sketch of the basic principles of the Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS):

**Figure 3:** Sketch of a basic WSS structure (Type A).  
This type consists of a sensor head, cable harness, and a connector.

**Figure 4:** Sketch of a basic WSS structure (Type B).  
This type includes a sensor head directly connected with a connector.

The WSS head is additionally subdivided into the following zones:
- **Sensor zone:** Contains a Twin head configuration.
- **Cable zone (Type A) / Connector zone (Type B):** Exact locations are specified in the offer drawing.

---

### Connector system  
The **connector system** provides the electrical contact between the WSS and the customer harness. It is composed of the WSS-connector and the vehicle-specific mating connector, which together form a connector system upon being plugged into each other.

---

### Reading area  
The **reading area** is the sensitive part of the WSS located directly across the target wheel surface. Its exact position is defined in the offer drawing.

---

### Mechanical air gap  
The **mechanical air gap** is the distance between the sensor reading area surface and the surface of the target wheel. For accurate measurements:
- For steel wheels, the lowest tooth must serve as the reference dimension.
- For multi-pole encoder wheels, the lowest position of the encoder’s magnetic track must be used as the reference dimension.

6 Supplier responsibilities.
The supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements:**

- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup:**  
  The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.
  
- **Spare Parts Support Cycle:**  
  The support period of after-sales spare parts shall ensure the life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.
  
- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts:**  
  The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This information should include:
  - BOM table.
  - Parts structure and function description.
  - Fault diagnosis.
  - Special tools for maintenance.
  - Relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).

**7 Intellectual Property / Copyright.**
Refer to VinFast General Terms and Conditions (GTC).

**8 Insurance / Warranties.**
Refer to VinFast General Terms and Conditions (GTC).

**9 VinFast GTC & Part Packaging and Incoterms.**
Refer to VinFast General Terms and Conditions, part packaging requirements, and Incoterm requirements specified in the RFQ package.
