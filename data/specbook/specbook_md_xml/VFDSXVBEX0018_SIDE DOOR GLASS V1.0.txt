**VinFast Management System**

**Legal requirements.**  
Compliance with any legal requirements relevant for windscreen and safety glass in all vehicle markets stated in General Project Requirements for Supplier (Part 1) is mandatory.

**Variants.**  
According to the complete vehicle feature list, the variants to consider are green glass and tinted glass (privacy). See also Appendix 1.

**Interfaces.**  
The components must be designed in a way that functionality is guaranteed in combination with all the adjoining systems and interfaces.

**Additional Requirements.**  
Transport and packaging concepts should be developed taking into consideration that the primer is already applied to the side window, ensuring it is not contaminated during transport to the plant (e.g., dust, grease, oil, etc.). For additional details, refer to Part 1: General Engineering Requirements VinFast.

**Test plan.**  
The test plan regulates who will conduct testing, when it will be done, and which testing devices are necessary. This plan must show results in good visual form, the progress of testing, and ensure test outcomes are continuously controlled. If VinFast requests verification of test results, SDS must deliver the necessary parts free of charge.

Test procedures and documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. The test plan must be updated weekly or supplemented whenever new data/information is needed due to development changes.

The SDS is responsible for the complete safeguarding of the component under their charge. Testing must be planned in a timely manner to ensure approvals or re-testing in case of negative results within agreed schedules. SDS must ensure relevant test protocols/reports are provided to VinFast for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing either at SDS sites or their testing centers.

Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast and SDS. Testing conducted with incorrect parts, missing parts, or alternative procedures must be redone at the expense of SDS. In the event of negative test results caused by the SDS, retesting must be arranged and paid for by SDS.

**Following data to be included in the DVP&R:**  
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, or legal requirement.  
- Description of testing setup, including specification of devices used during testing and supporting images.

Legal requirements. Compliance with any legal requirements relevant for Windscreen and safety glass in all vehicle markets stated in General Project Requirements for Supplier (Part 1) is mandatory.

Variants. According to the complete vehicle feature list, the variants that should be considered are green glass and tinted glass (privacy). See also appendix 1.

Interfaces. The components must be designed in a way that functionality is guaranteed in combination with all adjoining systems and interfaces.

Additional Requirements. Transport and packaging concepts should be developed taking into consideration that the primer is already applied to the side window and should not be contaminated during transport to the plant (e.g. dust, grease, oil, etc.). For any additional detail, please refer to Part 1: General Engineering Requirements VinFast.

Test plan. The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on its own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.  

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.  

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of their component has the SDS. Testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on committed schedules. The SDS has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VinFast/SDS.  

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the cost of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting has to be paid for by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.  

Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:  
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, or legal requirement.  
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).  
- Responsible test department.  
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).  
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in the form of a project plan).  
- Part variant and description of the part.  
- No. of tested components/parts.  

The SDS is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by the VF testing department. The initial data filling has to be completed by the SDS and submitted to VF (at least 4 weeks after the nomination of the SDS).  

The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.  

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SDS.  

The DVP&R has to be agreed upon between the test department (VF), SQA (VinFast), and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.  

Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each individual component.

### Testing

**General.** The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.17).  

It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.  

In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.  

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS must be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered from VinFast by the SDS.  

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.  

Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department must be provided by the SDS free of charge.  

The component developer must assure all relevant legislations for only their component. Moreover, it needs to be guaranteed that all internal VF-requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VF.  

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations must be achieved.  

All tests must be documented according to VF standards or, alternatively, to SDS standards if accepted by VF.  

The SDS must evaluate and perform the tests to be completed for the serial development phase according to the specification.  

The tests must be brought into the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.
</page>

<page number="13">
Samples for sample inspections must be made available on time or no later than the agreed date, coordinated with the test department. Manual samples may provide adequate information in certain cases to introduce measures in time for assembly issues, ensuring installation capability for test parts.

VinFast "Logistics" determines the number of sample parts, while VinFast "Purchase" orders them. Each delivery must include a measurement report for each sample part. Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing must be specified in the SDS quotation and ordered from VinFast by SDS. The SES must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports as required by the DVP&R. Disassembly and inspections must be carried out by SDS.

CAD data models complying with VinFast requirements must be provided on time for virtual sample manufacturing. The SDS must present corresponding samples to approval offices at VF with Cubing Report and Appearance Approval Report (VF Standard Color Matching / Appearance Approval N 85030). Matching parts from SDS have to be present, with timing provided by the matching department. Matching parts need to be free of charge, measured, and marked in accordance with VF Standards.

Marking sample parts should follow VF Standard VFDST00008700. Measurement reports should comply with VF Standard VFDST00008900. Evaluation systems must align with VF Standard VFDST00008300, and reference points must adhere to VF Standard VFDST00009400.

### Release by Test Departments
VinFast test departments will only release components if agreed test targets are achieved by SDS during complete vehicle integration tests. Positive test reports for all required DVP&R tests must be submitted by SDS. In case of negative test results or issues with parameters/processes, SDS must provide a test report, attend meetings upon request, and deliver solutions to preserve target milestones and commitments.

The first sheet of each report must clearly state "OK" or "NOK."

### Analyses and Test Reports
The SDS is responsible for providing electronic measurement reports (VFDST00008900) with agreed alignments and concepts for all parts during prototype generations. After tests, samples must be analyzed in detail, with measurement and test results documented in a comprehensive test report. The report must be handed over to the responsible VF department for release.

If requested, testing results and documentation (initial sample inspections and parallel inspections during development) must be shared with relevant VF specialists.
</page>

<page number="14">
### Test-Report/-Information
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (part no., change index, materials, production process, additives like grease, and every deviation from approved serial process).
- All parts must be labeled with descriptions.
- Reason for testing in case of negative test results with attachment of earlier test reports.

5.3 Material Requirement
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected.
</page>

<page number="17">
3. High corrosivity. Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. Very high corrosivity. Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. 

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, proper coating (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers) must be added. Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in lowest positions. Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements. Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement. 

Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.
