**General Description of the System / Component**

It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification are to be agreed between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:
- The carpet and insulation-specific requirements.
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of selling markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.

For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of the supplier, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time-schedule.

The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of selling markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class B and C common platform. VINFAST shall also monitor ongoing changes of rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target in SOP.

The supplier delivers the carpet and insulation as a module (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated).

**Add-on parts not included in the delivery range of the supplier** are to be taken into consideration as purchase parts. Add-on parts are: Electrical components and carry-over parts.

For the documentation of the release, the following sheets and documents are necessary:
- Drawings.
- Simulations (e.g., mold flow analysis).
- Quality regulations.
- Results/documentation of test validation.
- Documentation of the FMEA.

All parts of the assembly must be matched to each other.

Functional dimensions must be fulfilled according to the prescription.

**BOM Parts**
- **Final (F)**: End item level delivered to VinFast.
- **Component (C)**: Assembled by suppliers.

**Function.**

**Overall function:**

Development targets:

- Prevention of functional and qualitative problems out of known systems.
- Use of standard and common parts if possible or reasonable.
- Process reliability at production, packaging, transport, and assembly.
- Minimize effort of overall production sequence: production, packaging, transport, and assembly.
- Prevention of displacement.
- Integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of the part package (Simultaneous Engineering) from the concept phase onwards. Early inclusion of the developers of neighboring components (body shell, finishers, etc.).
- General reduction of costs compared to predecessor models.
- Further improvement of the acoustic, optical, and functional characteristics.
- Fulfilling ergonomic requirements (e.g., leg position).
- Functionality has to be ensured within temperature range -30°C (-5°C for Vietnam market) till 85°C.

**Stiffness / rigidity / stability of shape:**

- Especially in the area of the operating elements, the components and brackets design has to assure that no instability is noticeable.
- Irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, and visible waviness under climatic change loads are prohibited.

**Carpet/foot rest requirements:**

No detaching, fracturing, or splitting of parts at all crash tests.

**Interfaces.**

The components must be designed such that the function is guaranteed in combination with the adjoining systems considering tolerances and thermal influences.

The interfaces must be worked out in cooperation with VINFAST in consideration of a quality method (e.g., FMEA, risk filter).

### Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:
Not applicable.

### Recycling Requirements:
#### Recycled Materials:
When selecting materials, attention must be focused on reducing the variety of materials and ensuring compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called "proven recycling technologies"). Secondary raw materials (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics) must be preferred where available in the market. Recycled materials should be marked according to defined standards in this specification book and reported to the environmental compliance expert team at VINFAST.

#### Recycling Scheme:
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at the end of life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor must show a simple layout for possible recycling processes.

Recycling scheme:
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. 

The recycling process of the component must include information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.
</page>

<page number="20">
Recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental expert’s team at VINFAST before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### Material Requirements & Corrosion
Please refer to the VINFAST Request for Quotation.

#### Additional Requirements
None applicable.

### Test Plan
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be conducted, along with which testing devices are necessary. This plan shows the results in a visually clear format and tracks progress. Controlling of test results must be ensured at all times. If VINFAST requests verification of test results independently, the SDS must deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer from VINFAST. 

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly during the testing phase or whenever new data/information due to development changes is required. 

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of components lies with the SDS. Testing must be planned in sufficient time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. 

The SDS must ensure VINFAST receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VINFAST may attend any testing at SDS sites or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon with VINFAST and SDS.

If tests are conducted with incorrect parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing must be redone at the expense of SDS. In cases of negative test results, retesting must be re-planned, with costs borne by SDS if they were responsible for the failure.

#### Data Included in the DVP&R:
- Testing declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirement.
- Description of testing setup, including pictures.
- Identification of responsible test department.
- Location of testing (internal/external).
- Duration and timeline of testing (in the form of a project plan).
- Part variant and part description.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is required to use the DVP&R template provided by the VINFAST testing department. The content of the DVP&R is the responsibility of SDS. The SDS must plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (when defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.
</page>

<page number="21">
In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST. 

The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VINFAST departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department SQA (VINFAST) and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.

### Testing
#### General
The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.16). 

It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.

In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS have to be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered by the SDS from VINFAST. 

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for only his component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VINFAST requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VINFAST. 

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved. 

All tests must be documented according to VINFAST standard, alternatively to SDS standard if this is accepted by VINFAST.

The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification.

The tests have to be brought into the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.

Samples for sample inspections are to be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (in coordination with the test department).

VINFAST Logistics determines the number of sample parts; VINFAST Purchase orders the parts.

A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS.
</page>

<page number="22">
Release by test-departments. The responsible VINFAST test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved from the SDS and during the complete vehicle integration tests. The SDS must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any problems (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the SDS must submit a test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions to keep all milestones and observe all targets. OK or NOK result needs to be stated on the first sheet of the report.

Analyses and test-reports. The SDS has to provide measurement reports according to VINFAST specification (VFDST00008900) [43] in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts. After the individual tests, the test samples have to be analyzed in detail. The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report has to be handed over to the responsible VINFAST department for release.

Upon request, the results, together with the documentation of the tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development), are to be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release.

### Virtual Testing
Suitable calculation methods are to be utilized, and adequately detailed calculation models created by SDS, for verifying and effectively optimizing the component properties defined within the technical specifications, test procedures, and applicable laws/regulations. Specific focus must be given to mechanical properties such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety using FEM calculations.

The tool dimensioning for injection molding must be optimized using corresponding simulations. Upon VINFAST's request, operative calculation models representing the respective development status must be made available for internal calculations and integration work. SDS will provide suitable FEM models free of charge upon request. Additionally, the SDS must ensure the calculative documentation of tests as per the evaluation plan (e.g., FEM) before completing the tool dimensioning.

<page number="24">
Component testing. These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VINFAST and the SDS, and will be binding.
- Climatic change test according VFDST00046100 [35].
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800) [35].
- Ageing of automotive components in solar simulation units DIN 75220 [13].

Mechanical integration tests. The following tests will be done as mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle.
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100) [35].
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800) [37].
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000) [48].
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00008500) [36].

Basically, no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range is allowed. In particular, by the use of materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients, the behavior has to be kept. The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded. These tests are binding as per the DVP.

If VINFAST orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at the VINFAST test department must be provided by the SDS free of charge.

Geometrical Integration. **RPS (reference position system):** The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. A RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts must align with the RPS-system VFDST00000011 [34] as per the interior- and BIW-department.

**Tolerance analyses:** The following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems, including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermal change tests among all climate terms.
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.

Arrangements are necessary to ensure the required gap dimension of components.

**Clearance Wiring Harness:** A clearance of a minimum of 8mm to the wiring harness is needed.
