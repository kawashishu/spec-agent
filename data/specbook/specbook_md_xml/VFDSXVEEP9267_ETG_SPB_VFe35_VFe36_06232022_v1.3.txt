### 1 General Document Guidelines  

#### 1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.  
This version is legally binding.  
This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard.  

VinFast Released.
</page>

<page number="7">
Requirement documents are divided into three levels. These levels are complementary to each other, meaning that content not included in Part 1 may be found in Part 2, and so on. All three levels are legally binding. In the event of a conflict about content, the higher-level document takes precedence (e.g., level 3 versus level 2 — level 2 is applicable).

**1.2 Language**
This document is written in English.  
All official project documentations must be completed in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

**1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.**
The following wording rules are consistently used throughout this document:

- **Shall**  
  The word “shall” is used to express a binding requirement. These requirements are externally verifiable through manipulation or observation.

- **Should**  
  The word “should” is used to express preferences or desirable implementation characteristics that are not strictly binding.

- **May**  
  The word “may” is used to identify options that are left to the implementer.

**Requirements Traceability:**

| Requirement Number | Requirement Text | CONFIG |
|---------------------|------------------|--------|
| REQ-IDNBR-VER      | Requirement Text need | Criteria |

*Remark:* Text serves as example guidance and is not binding.

**Criteria Breakdown:**

- **REQ**:  
  - **GEN**: Generic application, non-specific.  
  - **PROJ**: Project-specific, such as VF35, VF36, or VFe35.  

- **IDNBR**:  
  Unique identification number, identified by a combination of letters (e.g., EL for Exterior Lighting) and numbers ranging from 0001 to 9999.

- **VER**:  
  Version of the requirement, marked from .01 to .99.  

- **CONFIG**:  
  Configuration criteria:  

| Config | Scope       |
|--------|-------------|
| A      | VF35 & VF36 |
| B      | VF35        |
| C      | VF36        |
| D      | ICE & BEV   |

# Functions  

## Overview Functions Description  
The ETG allows remote power opening/closing of the vehicle's trunk with certain height adjustment predefined by the user. The Key Fob signal is detected by the ETG, which transfers a CAN signal to the BCM to allow power opening/closing. The system also provides an FKS sensor that detects the user's kick signal and supports the above-mentioned function. Alternatively, the Tailgate Switch can be used for the same purpose.

| ID | Function Name                | Function Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01 | Initialization               | In order for the ETG to be initialized, its Full Latch SW should be OFF. If there is an ongoing or uncompleted action, Initialization shall take place after it. Communication should be established between ETG → XGW / XGW → BCM. |
| 02 | Power Open Function          | To activate the Power Opening Function, the ETG should be fully closed. The BCM detects the Key, Lift-gate Switch, or MHU Signal, which will be communicated via the Body CAN Bus to the XGW. ETG will perform Power Opening. FKS activation is communicated through LIN interface. |
| 03 | Power Close Function         | The Power Closing Function requires the ETG to be fully open or set to the user-adjusted height. The BCM detects Switch Signal or MHU Signal, then communicates this via the Body CAN Bus or XGW to ETG for Power Closing. |
| 04 | Customer Input Function      | ETG registers customer height input for future use. When the desired height is reached, a 3-second long press of the Lift-gate Closing Switch triggers the BCM to send a CAN Signal to save the input. Data loss resets height settings to factory presets. |
| 05 | Anti-Pinch Function          | The Anti-Pinch function activates if the Power Strut Hall Sensor detects physical resistance. During opening, it reverses 10mm and stops; during closing, the strut informs the ETG to reverse completely to the open position. |
| 06 | Foot Kick Sensor Operation   | The electric tailgate or power-operated tailgate can be opened easily from the driving seat or via the remote control button.                                                                            |
| 07 | Flashing via OBD             | ETG supports software updates through the OBD port according to VinFast specifications.                                                                                                                  |
| 08 | Diagnosis                    | ETG supports diagnostic services as per VinFast specifications.                                                                                                                                          |
| 09 | FOTA                         | ETG supports software updates through Info-CAN triggered by the MHU.                                                                                                                                     |
| 10 | Cybersecurity                | ETG conforms to cybersecurity standards as specified by VinFast.                                                                                                                                         |

  - **Release Side Reset:**  
    - Action occurs between the neutral position and the cinching side.  
    - The ECU drives the latch motor in a negative direction, and the NTL signal changes from 1 to 0.  
    - After the NTL signal change, the ECU delays the action by T1, then stops the motor.  
  - **Cinching Side Reset:**  
    - Action occurs between the neutral position and the release side.  
    - The ECU drives the latch motor in a positive direction, and the NTL signal changes from 0 to 1.  
    - After the NTL signal change, the ECU delays the action by T2, then stops the motor.

5.3.3.1.1 Reset process.  
The reset process is executed during the power latch initialization and includes two methods: Release side reset and Cinching side reset.  

- **Release side reset**:  
  This action occurs when the power latch’s position is between Neutral position and Cinching side. The ECU drives the latch motor to rotate in a negative direction, and the NTL signal changes from (1 to 0) during the release side reset action. The ECU delays T1, then drives the latch motor to stop after the NTL signal has changed.  

- **Cinching side reset**:  
  This action occurs when the power latch’s position is between Neutral position and Release side. The ECU drives the latch motor to rotate in a positive direction, and the NTL signal changes from (0 to 1) during the Cinching side reset action. The ECU delays T2, then drives the latch motor to stop after the NTL signal has changed.

**5.3.3.3 ECU Initialization**  
ECU has to execute initialization when it powers on for the first time or powers on again. Initialization includes power latch initialization and ETG position initialization. Functions such as power opening or closing and setting the position of maximum open angle are forbidden when ECU initialization has not been completed.  

**5.3.3.3.1 Power latch initialization:**  
- Power latch motor could be in any position of its route when ECU is powered on. Power latch executes initialization by checking latch’s status and the level of Neutral SW.  
1. When power latch is in half latch or full latch status, ECU executes the action of cinching and cinching reset, and the power latch will be initialized after actions are completed successfully.  
2. When power latch is in unlock status and Neutral SW is high level, ECU executes the action of release side reset, and power latch will be initialized after Neutral SW jumps to low level.  
3. When power latch is in unlock status and Neutral SW is low level, ECU executes the action of cinching side reset, and power latch will be initialized after Neutral SW jumps to high level.  

---

**5.3.3.3.2 ETG position initialization:**  
ETG position is initialized by checking Full latch SW (FUL=OFF). Close the ETG to half-latch or full-latch status manually, and ETG position will be initialized after the power latch’s action is completed.  

---

**5.3.3.3.4 ETG power open action:**  
When ETG is in a fully closed position, or the last running direction of ETG is "close," power open action is executed by the operations below. The buzzer rings to indicate an operation acceptance alarm, and then the power latch executes a release action when ETG is in a fully closed position or near the half-latch position. Lift motors drive the ETG to open. Release reset action of the power latch is executed after ETG opens a certain distance. Lift motors stop when ETG moves to the fully opened position.  

### The following operations will start ETG power open action:  
1. ETG’s Gate switch pressed once.  
2. Handle switch signal received.  
3. Drive switch signal received.

5.5 Safety Requirements

GEN-SR0003.01 Safety Goals & Functional Safety Requirements and associated attributes.  
- Safety goal requirement ONLY case where the requirement may state what not to do.  
  - FTTI: Attribute of the safety goal as well as a safe state.  
  - ASIL: Attribute of the safety goal.  

CONFIG: B+D  

GEN-SR0004.01 No signal name per se should appear in the requirement. Only physical entities (e.g., speed, accel, yaw) as controlled or perceived by the user of the system or information entities (e.g., accel pedal) if the item is a subsystem of the vehicle.  

CONFIG: B+D  

GEN-SR0005.01 Requirements may be assigned to subsystems already or only to the systems as per ISO definition and the item definition.  

CONFIG: B+D  

GEN-SR0006.01 FTTI: Most of the time inherited from the safety goal. Potentially, the FTTI is already decomposed (see below ASIL decomposition).  

CONFIG: B+D  

GEN-SR0007.01 ASIL: Likely no ASIL decomposition at that stage but possible if the item is a subsystem of the vehicle interacting with an existing subsystem to mitigate a risk.  

CONFIG: B+D  

GEN-SR0008.01 Distributed safety architecture. The VCU will detect any excursion of the vehicle acceleration and will shut down the electric machine torque in case of a detected hazardous scenario.
