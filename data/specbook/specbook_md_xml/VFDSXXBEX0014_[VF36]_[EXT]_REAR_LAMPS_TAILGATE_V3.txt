- In areas of high stone hitting risk, choose part materials and paint which have the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts which have edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.

For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle, deepen them so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.

**5.3 Homologation and safety regulation requirements**  

**5.3.1 North America**  
a. **Homologation and safety regulation activities:**  
   The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., European, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.  

b. **Self-certification and test report(s):**  
   The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
   The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  
   *Refer Appendix 8 of Manufacturer Handbook*  

c. **Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance:**  
   Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.  

**5.3.2 Europe**  
a. **Homologation and safety regulation activities:**  
   The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.  

b. **Test report(s) and Certificate(s):**  
   The supplier is responsible for ensuring their part(s), product(s), or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests the supplier to conduct tests as specified in certain UN-ECE authorized technical services.  
   The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance. VinFast also requests the supplier to submit supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings to be submitted to the relevant authorities to obtain certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any).  
   The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

7 Supplier Responsibilities

The provided table specifies the detailed responsibilities for suppliers concerning key deliverables. These responsibilities are organized using the RASIC framework:

- **R: Responsible** — The supplier is expected to actively execute the tasks and ensure the proper fulfillment of requirements.
- **A: Approval** — Suppliers must obtain approval for their deliverables when required by the VinFast project team.
- **S: Support** — Suppliers must provide necessary support that may include capacity, financial resources, and expertise transfer.
- **I: Information** — Suppliers have the right to request and receive relevant information to assist in completing their deliverables.

The deliverables include items ranging from initial concept proposals, commodity strategies, detailed design and validation, milestone completion, CAD data submissions, functional CAE analysis, tooling processes, and final assembly standards, among others. Each task specifies the responsible party's role, approval requirements, support requirements, and information obligations.

Suppliers must adhere to their specified roles for each deliverable in accordance with the latest RASIC framework and Master Timing updates provided by VinFast production management teams.

Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier Responsibilities are itemised to help mitigate the risk to the organisation of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

## Customer Service Requirements

### After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

### Spare Parts Support Cycle.  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall not be shorter than 15 years after VINFAST starts production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.  

### Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as:  
- BOM table  
- Parts structure and function description  
- Fault diagnosis  
- Special tools for maintenance  
- Relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearance, parts performance parameters)  

## 8 Intellectual Property / Copyright  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).  

## 9 Insurance / Warranties  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).  

## 10 VinFast GTC & Part Packaging and Incoterms  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition, Part packaging requirements, and Incoterms requirements in the RFQ package.  

## 11 Appearance Approval Process  

The Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is applicable by suppliers to supply components affecting CMF appearance that require VinFast approval prior to PPAP deliverables. This report verifies that the VinFast Design Quality has inspected the final product and it meets all the required appearance specifications for the design.  

### Harmony Review.  
Harmony review is significantly important to ensure the components' quality or state of being homogeneous with adjacent parts.  

### Submission Requirements.  
Design Quality requires all suppliers to submit non-commercial value sample parts.  
Suppliers are required to submit:  
- Complete assembly parts (P-level) known as purchase parts.  
- Child parts (D-level) known as component parts.  

The quantity of parts to be submitted is detailed in VFDST00038401.
