---

### 5.5.2 Software:

The WLC software shall support functionality via LIN signal through BCM:  

#### Charging Function/Status on Center Display:
- **Working Process:**  
  - IGN is ON and all doors closed.  
  - If a phone is on the pad, charging starts.  
  - If any door opens, charging stops.  
  - When all doors are closed again, charging resumes.  

- WLC sends LIN signal `Transmit_WLC_situation (0x35)` to inform WLC status:  
  - `0x00`: "Power OFF"  
  - `0x02`: "Charging"  
  - `0x03`: "Charging complete"

#### Setting ON/OFF Function:
- MHU sends signal ON/OFF to BCM via CAN.  
- BCM sends the signal through LIN signal (`0x31`) to WLC to set ON/OFF state.  

#### Reminder: Phone Forgotten in Car
- When IGN status transitions from ON to OFF:  
  - If the phone remains on the pad and the driver/passenger door opens, WLC sends LIN signal (`0x35`) with logic `0x01` to notify the user of the forgotten phone.  
  - **Note:** Some manufacturers' smartphones (e.g., iPhone) may not trigger notifications due to unique device characteristics. This is not considered a malfunction of the wireless charger.

#### Inform/Notify: Foreign Object Detection (e.g., Coin, Metal)
- Identifies and notifies users of foreign objects detected on the charging pad.

---

#### 5.5.1.3 Microcontroller:
The system uses the MCU: F32SK144MNT0MLHT (NXP) to control the wireless charging function.  
The Main MCU communicates with the internal Wireless Charger ASIC IC through I2C communication.  
Additionally, communication is established with other external units via LIN communication.

---

#### 5.5.1.4 LIN Transceiver:
The Wireless Charger (WLC) communicates with external units via LIN communication.  
**Communication Speed:** 19.2 kbit/s.

---

#### 5.5.1.5 WLC Operation Frequency:
The nominal operation frequency is 115 kHz.

---

#### 5.5.2 Software:
The WLC software supports functionalities via LIN signals through the BCM.

**Charging Function/Status on Center Display:**
- **Working Process:**  
  When IGN is ON and all doors are closed, if a phone is placed on the pad, charging initiates.  
  If any door is opened, charging stops. It auto-resumes when all doors are closed again.
- **LIN Signal:**  
  WLC sends the LIN signal `Transmit_WLC_situation (0x35)` to inform the WLC's status:  
  - `0x00`: Power OFF.  
  - `0x02`: Charging.  
  - `0x03`: Charging complete.

**Setting ON/OFF Function:**
- The MHU sends the ON/OFF signal to the BCM via CAN.  
- The BCM then relays this as LIN signal `0x31` to the WLC to set the ON/OFF state.

**Reminder - Forgotten Phone in Car:**
- When IGN changes from ON to OFF, and the driver or assistant door is opened with a phone present on the pad, the WLC sends the LIN signal `0x35` with logic `0x01` to notify the user.  
- **Note:** Some smartphones (e.g., iPhone) may not trigger this notification due to their unique characteristics. This is not a fault of the wireless charger.

**Foreign Object Detection (FOD):**
- If a large object (e.g., a coin with a diameter >26 mm) is detected between the WLC and phone at the center of the pad, the WLC sends the LIN signal `WLC_FOD_Error (0x37)` with logic `0x01`.  
- Upon removal, it clears the error with logic `0x00`.  
- Charging resumes automatically when the object is removed.  

**Note on Qi Standard Passing:**  
FOD detects only large objects like coins (>26 mm diameter), placed directly at the center between the charging coils of the WLC charger and the phone. It may not detect smaller objects or objects misplaced outside the center of the WLC.

---

#### SMK Unit LF Frequency Interference Prevention:
This function helps avoid interference between the wireless charging frequency and the smart key unit frequency band:
- LIN signal `FOB_Searching (0x30)` values:  
  - `1`: Searching mode ON.  
  - `0`: Searching mode OFF.  
- Wireless charging halts while LF mode is active.  
  - Example: Charging stops if the driver carries the smart key out of the vehicle during IG ON.  
  - Operation resumes when LF mode is completed.

---

#### LIN Signal Error Reporting:
Errors reported via LIN signals (managed by BCM):  
- Internal IC error.  
- FAN fault.  
- Temperature sensor error (e.g., sensor disconnected).

5.17. Mechanical Requirements.

**5.17.1 Load.**  
**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast.  
The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.

**Special events:**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur, and the intended service life will not be reduced.

**Misuse events:**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact.  

The vehicle must be dimensioned that:
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations. Either to the same or neighboring components (principle “deformation before break”).
</page>

<page number="37">
5.17 Mechanical Requirements  

5.17.2 Vibration Behavior.  
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 30Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VinFast. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.

5.17.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics.  
Not applicable.

5.17.4 Deformation.

5.17.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance.  

**Fan:**  
If the electrical control unit contains cooling fans, no tonal frequency bands are acceptable (adjacent bars must not be exceeded by 3dB).

**S&R, General:**  
Noises perceived by customers as disturbing have to be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier has to guarantee that components are free of noise disturbances in their vehicle environment and geometrical integration. Similarly, while exposed to vehicle- and audio system excitation under all environmental conditions and over the fixed component service life. There must not be squeak or rattle noise due to body excitation (e.g., wind load, torsional flexing) or real relative movements on surfaces. This requirement must be met for the entire range of operating and environmental conditions like temperature and humidity.  

To evidence the absence of disturbing noise, requirements must be coordinated with the responsible testing team. The supplier must support the development of vibration and acoustic behavior for subsystems in the complete vehicle environment. Constant acoustic quality of delivered parts must be ensured. This involves pointing out problems and making active proposals to solve them. The supplier must also provide parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation as requested free of charge.

Several validation cycles for electrical systems and functions are planned to guarantee correct implementation and will be carried out according to mentioned standards. The generic Function Release Step (FRS) is outlined in the picture. The detailed timing and description of each FRS are defined in the FRS Plan (see “VINFAST_FRS_plan.pdf”). The FRS plan has to be fulfilled by every electric component.

#### Diagram Description:
The diagram outlines the Function Release Steps (FRS). It includes stages such as Setup for Network Testing, Subsystem Testing, Labcar Testing, and Field Testing moving toward the Final Release (FR).

Components are subjected to these validation cycles to ensure functionality standards, compliance, and system integration.

6.3 Physical testing

For early physical and software testing Lab Cars, Network Test Bench, and several Subsystem Test Benches will be set up. Parts such as ECUs, sensors, actuators, connectors, etc., shall be delivered free of charge for physical testing, e.g., 12 units for FRS LC2. Key electrical tests will be defined to support the road release of test vehicles. 

Generally, all main simulation and testing activities on vehicle level are outlined in DVP. Tests in supplier responsibility are outlined in respective component/system specifications. Engine start needs to be possible after 5 weeks of the vehicle’s non-operative state (idle time).

6.4 Vehicle Testing

The testing must be performed as defined in the VF testing standards. The component has to withstand the following tests on complete vehicle level:

**Durability testing:**
- Rough road durability run
- Lateral force durability run
- Drive train shortened durability run
- Long distance durability run (mixed circuit)

**Special events:**
The design and development process covers the following events:
- Extreme braking (ABS-braking forward/rearward on Belgium block from 40kph)
- Bump & Pothole test at 40kph
