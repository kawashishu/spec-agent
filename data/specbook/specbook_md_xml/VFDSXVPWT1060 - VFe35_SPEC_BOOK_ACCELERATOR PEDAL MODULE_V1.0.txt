## 3 Terms

### 3.1 Pedal angle
The pedal angle is the angle which the pedal plate describes about its axis of rotation at the midpoint of the film hinge. The pedal angle is specified in degrees of angle [°] as well as in percent [%] of the mechanically maximum possible pedal angle if required.

**Figure 1:** XZ section through the accelerator pedal module (schematic diagram, in the motor vehicle coordinate system according to DIN ISO 4130).

### 3.2 Force application point
The force application point is the point on the pedal plate at which the force to actuate the accelerator pedal module is applied.  
The distance of the force application point from the pivot axis of the pedal plate is always measured vertically with respect to the pedal plate.  
If not otherwise specified, the force application point on the pedal plate is at a distance of 175 mm from its pivot axis.

### 3.3 Actuating forces
The actuating forces are the forces applied by the driver’s foot to the accelerator pedal module during operation.
</page>

<page number="6">
### 3.4 Misuse Forces
Misuse forces are the forces that are applied as the result of irregular operation such as pressing down on the accelerator pedal while entering the vehicle.

### 3.5 Pedal Position Sensor
The pedal position sensor registers the pedal angle defined by the driver and converts it into proportional electrical signals.

---

### 4 Coordinate System
The accelerator pedal module is to be represented in a clockwise rotating, orthogonal coordinate system. The origin of the coordinate system is located at the base of the module on the mounting plane of the screw connection point to the body. 

- **Z-axis:** Projected upward in the direction of the screw axis with positive values.
- **Y-axis:** Runs to the right (viewed in the direction of travel), parallel to the axis of rotation of the film hinge with positive values.

*A schematic diagram of the coordinate system is shown in Figure 2.*

---

### 5 Functional Requirements
The accelerator pedal module is arranged in the installation area "Interior, without special requirement." Consequently, this arrangement gives rise to ambient conditions (e.g., temperature spectrum and test duration) in accordance with standard VFDST00028131.

#### Environmental Stressors and Conditions:
- Subjected to dry dust, dust containing grease, snow, snow slush, water, ice, moist dirt, sharp-edged stones, metal and/or magnetic parts, and corrosive media such as thawing salts, lubricants, and brake fluid.
- Subjection to electromagnetic vibration from devices such as mobile telephones and DVD players, as outlined in VFDST00034902.

#### Design Considerations for Stress and Strain:
Stress and strain induced by increased temperatures or vibration excitations must be considered in the design layout of the accelerator pedal module.
</page>

<page number="7">
### 5.1 Requirements relating to the operating mechanism of the accelerator pedal module.
The accelerator pedal module is to be designed such that the pivot axis of the pedal plate is arranged below the standard force application point of the driver’s foot as defined in section 3.2 (“Upright accelerator pedal”). The accelerator pedal module must be equipped with two spring elements, not hindering each other, for the purpose of producing the legally required self-reset of the pedal plate which also serves the purpose of providing operational feedback for the driver. The pedal angle that can be produced by the actuating force must be limited by solid, dampened stops.

The mechanically realized pedal angle must be 16° ± 0.5°.

#### 5.1.1 Basic force/angle characteristic.
The force-angle characteristic shown in Fig. 3 is to be realized and must be ensured at room temperature. The specifications defined in VFDST00034902 apply in terms of extreme temperatures. All specified values refer to the standard force application point in accordance with section 3.2.

In the variant for automatic transmission vehicles, the kick-down force boost described in section 5.1.2 is to be superimposed on this basic characteristic.

#### Characteristics and Properties:
- **Entry in the characteristic curve:**  
    The entry in the characteristic curve should be as small as possible (target: 0.2°) and must take place within the first 0.5° pedal angle without overshoot.  
- **Runout of characteristic curve before end stop:**  
    The runout of the characteristic curve should meet operational requirements for performance, ensuring smooth transition without excessive force.

#### Figure Description:
**Figure 3:** The diagram illustrates the definition of force characteristics for manual transmission vehicles. It includes key features such as entry angle, actuating angle, gradient (m), hysteresis, force increase, force regression, and runout angle. This visual representation serves to define operational behavior and the force-angle relation across the pedal's actuation range.

### 5 Functional Requirements

#### 5.1 Requirements Relating to the Operating Mechanism of the Accelerator Pedal Module  

The accelerator pedal module is to be designed such that the pivot axis of the pedal plate is arranged below the standard force application point of the driver’s foot as defined in section 3.2 ("Upright accelerator pedal"). The accelerator pedal module must be equipped with two spring elements, not hindering each other, for the purpose of producing the legally required self-reset of the pedal plate which also serves the purpose of providing operational feedback for the driver. The pedal angle that can be produced by the actuating force must be limited by solid, dampened stops.  

The mechanically realized pedal angle must be **16° ± 0.5°**.  

##### 5.1.1 Basic Force / Angle Characteristic  

The force-angle characteristic shown in Fig. 3 is to be realized and must be ensured at room temperature. The specifications defined in VFDST00034902 apply in terms of extreme temperatures. All specified values refer to the standard force application point in accordance with section 3.2.  

In the variant for automatic transmission vehicles, the kick-down force boost described in section 5.1.2 is to be superimposed on this basic characteristic.  

###### Figure 3  
Description: Force characteristic for manual transmission vehicles illustrating entry angle, force increase, gradient, hysteresis, and runout angle.

The characteristic curve must exhibit the following properties:

- **Entry in the characteristic curve:**  
  The entry in the characteristic curve should be as small as possible (target: 0.2°) and must take place within the first 0.5° pedal angle without overshoot.  
- **Runout of characteristic curve before end stop:**  
  The runout of the characteristic curve should be as small as possible and must take place within the last 0.3° pedal angle before the mechanical end stop.  
- **Position of characteristic curve:**  
  The position of the rising branch of the characteristic curve is defined by the characteristic of the pedal force shown in Fig. 4.  

###### Figure 4  
Description: Pedal force characteristic illustrating pedal travel and pedal force ranges for rising branch in manual transmission vehicles.

- **Gradient of characteristic curve:**  
  The gradient of the pedal characteristic curve must be within the following value range:

<page number="9">
### 5.1.2 Kick-down force boost for automatic modules
To facilitate use in automatic transmission vehicles, a pedal force boost, referred to as kick-down force boost, is superimposed on the basic characteristic defined in section 5.1.1. This boost is active in the end area of the pedal angle.

#### Figure 5: Force characteristic for automatic module
The superimposed kick-down force boost characteristic must exhibit the following properties:

- **Starting point of kick-down force boost (KD start):**
  - In the rising branch of pedal angle change, the kick-down force boost must start at a minimum of 13.2° pedal angle and not later than 1.6° pedal angle before the mechanical end stop.

- **KD Force boost:**
  - The maximum force boost must be (40 +5 / -10) N compared to KD start.

- **Force decline (KD decline):**
  - The ratio between KD force decline and KD force boost must fall within the range of 3:7 and 6:7.

- **Ratio between force rise (KD rise) and force drop (KD decline):**
  - The ratio between KD rise and KD decline must be between 1:1.6 and 1:3.

- **End point of kick-down force boost (KD end):**
  - In the decreasing branch of pedal angle change, the kick-down boost must terminate 1.6° before the mechanical end stop at a minimum and 13.2° pedal angle at a maximum.

The resulting kick-down haptics must be coordinated with the constituent’s corresponding technical department.

<page number="10">
# 5.2 Operational safety
The outer surfaces and edges of the accelerator pedal module, with which contact can be made during assembly and vehicle use, must exhibit no sharp burrs.

# 5.3 Actuating characteristic
The response characteristics, proportionability, and pedal travel are defined by the functional requirements in section 5.1. The resulting actuating characteristic in the vehicle is to be coordinated with the corresponding constituent’s technical department.

# 5.4 Acoustics
The accelerator pedal module must not radiate any disturbing mechanical vibrations. This requirement applies at functional, operational, and interfering noise levels, both to air-borne noise as well as structure-borne noise excitation. Noises produced during operation or by other influences (e.g., knocking against the accelerator pedal module with the foot) must not produce perceivable reverberations.

A quiet noise without reverberations as part of the kick-down force boost is permitted in agreement with the corresponding technical departments.

# 5.5 Strength requirements

## 5.5.1 Operating strength
The accelerator pedal module must retain its full operability over the required service life. Verification of this requirement is to be provided by the tests described in VFDST00034902. In addition, the constituent shall perform an operating strength test in the vehicle at the same time as testing the acoustic and functional properties.

## 5.5.2 Failure characteristics
In the case of pollution (e.g., sand, water) or when operating forces are applied in misuse situations, precautions must be taken (even in combination with extreme temperatures) to ensure that the pedal cannot jam due to sticking or snagging. The possibility of instabilities occurring in the force-angle characteristic (stick-slip effect), the sticking of the pedal plate, or a signal being output to the control unit contrary to the driver’s choice must be ruled out.

The accelerator pedal module must be designed to clearly identify damages caused by misuse of the driver. A defined damage chain must be complied with during misuse.

After a crash, the accelerator pedal module shall not have sharp edges or fractures that could result in injury to the driver’s foot. Thus, for the housing material, no brittle materials shall be used that may split. A glass fiber content of the housing material of > 30% must be avoided.
</page>

<page number="11">
5.6 Corrosion.  
The metal parts of the accelerator pedal module must have their surfaces coated as specified in VFDST00000100 for drawing parts or VFDST00007000 for minor corrosion stress (value 1). Non-coated parts must pass the tests outlined in VFDST00034902 without corrosion, visual impairment, or functional degradation.

5.7 Requirements relating to the sensor system.  
The sensor system must precisely and unambiguously record the pedal angle position and convert it into voltage signals proportional to the pedal angle. The system must have a redundant configuration with two galvanically isolated sensors providing voltage signals such that U1 equals 2 x U2. Power for the sensors is supplied through the engine management, and each channel must operate on its separate voltage source.  
All output signals conforming to VFDST00034902 must operate under all specified temperature conditions and throughout the module's service life.

5.7.1 Electrical characteristics.  
Output signals beyond the ranges defined herein are classified as errors by vehicle evaluator systems. Such signals must not occur during trouble-free operation.

5.7.1.1 Electric characteristics of the manual transmission variant.  
Figure 6 illustrates the progression of two output signals relative to the pedal angle. It also includes pedal force hysteresis to demonstrate the correlations.  
In this figure, "Voltage sensor 1" and "Voltage sensor 2" are plotted alongside "Force F" over the pedal angle. The relationships between electrical idle, full throttle, and force hysteresis are depicted.

<page number="12">
5.7.1.2 Electrical characteristics of automatic transmission variant  
Fig. 7 shows the progression of the two output signals over the pedal angle. The progression of the pedal force hysteresis is also shown to illustrate the interrelationships.  

Figure 7: Force/voltage angle diagram for automatic transmission variant.  

The voltage values specified in Table 2 are to output by the sensors as a percentage of the supply voltage UB.  

**Table 2: Voltage values of the output signals**  
| Voltage description        | Signal | Value [% of UB] | Tolerance [% of UB] |  
|----------------------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------|  
| Sensor 1 at idle speed     | U1     | 15              | ± 1                |  
| Sensor 1 at end stop       | U1     | 80              | ± 2.6 ¹           |  
| Sensor 2 at idle speed     | U2     | 7.5             | ± 1                |  
| Sensor 2 at end stop       | U2     | 40              | ± 2.6 ¹           |  
¹ Misuse +5%  

The electrical characteristics detail the behavior of the sensors in response to pedal movement, ensuring functional accuracy and compliance under standard and misuse conditions.

<page number="13">
5.7.2 Signal quality  
All output signals must be output either infinitely variable or with a minimum resolution of 10 bits (referred to the voltage range from 0 V to UB).  

- **Linearity:**  
  The linearity ∆U(ϕ) at a constant supply voltage UB (from the interval 4.5 V ≤ UB ≤ 5.5 V) at the pedal angle ϕ is assessed in terms of a regression straight line y = αϕ + b over the measuring range (total actuating range of the pedal) from 0 - 16° pedal angle (independent linearity).  
  ∆U(ϕ) = Umess(ϕ) - (αϕ + b),  
  where Umess(ϕ) is a sensor voltage value of the accelerator pedal module at the angle ϕ. Permissible deviations are defined in **Table 3.**

- **Micro linearity (∆m):**  
  The micro linearity at the point ϕ (pedal angle) over the angle interval ∆ϕ ([ϕ - ∆ϕ/2, ϕ + ∆ϕ/2]) is  
  ∆m(ϕ) = Umess(ϕ) - y∆ϕ(ϕ).  
  Here, Umess(ϕ) is a sensor voltage value of the accelerator pedal module at the angle ϕ, and y∆ϕ = βϕ + c represents the linear regression of the sensor characteristic at the angle interval ∆ϕ. Permissible deviations are again defined in **Table 3.**

**Table 3: Signal Quality**  
| Description               | Condition          | Min  | Max  | Unit       |
|---------------------------|--------------------|------|------|------------|
| Linearity ∆U(ϕ)           | 4.5 V ≤ UB ≤ 5.5 V | -2.0 | 2.0  | % of UB    |
| Micro linearity ∆m         | ∆ϕ = 0.2°         | -0.25| 0.25 | % of UB    |
| Synchronism over entire temperature range | Synchronism = 100 ⋅ (2 ⋅ U2 - U1) / UB | -2.0 | 2.0  | %          |
</page>

<page number="14">
5.7 Signal Quality  
The signal quality must be guaranteed over the entire temperature range and service life of the accelerator pedal module. The sensor system must be designed such that a change in the output signal occurs 1.5 ms at the latest after a change in the actuation angle. The signal must have executed at least 63 % of the change within this time (including dead time).  

5.7.3 Electrical Requirements  
If not otherwise specified, the requirements defined in VFDST00028122 shall apply. The requirements defined in VFDST00027101-02-05 must be taken into account during the development of the accelerator pedal module.

All required properties must not be influenced by voltage fluctuations within this range (taking into account the ratiometry specified in section 5.7.1).  

The voltage progression over the time between 0 V and operating voltage UB while switching on and off can be arbitrary. This must not cause damage to or functionally impair the accelerator pedal module.  

The internal resistance of the power supply unit can adopt the following values:  
0 < Ri ≤ 33 Ω  

5.7.3.2 Current Intake  
No sensor must exceed the current intake values specified in Table 4.
