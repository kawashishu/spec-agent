1.4 Camera installation structure design.  
The VF89FL infrared camera is fixed with an extension bracket through the plastic bottom cover. The plastic bracket has a positioning function. The camera and steering cover are fixed by 3 D2.5mm screws. The screws pass through the plastic bracket of the bottom cover and are locked with the steering shroud screw post.  

The total weight of the camera with the bracket does not exceed 100 grams. Therefore, the design of the camera and its fixed components must comply with the vibration standards specified in VFDST00028131-10.4 p26.

2 Installation specifications.

2.1 Installation area and requirement.
Through communication with customers, the IR-Camera was installed inside the steering shroud and fixed on the screw boss inside the steering shroud through the plastic bracket. Recommended mounting height is 22.45 +/- 0.5 mm. The recommended locking torque is ST3.0x8.5, torque 3.0 +/- 0.45 Kg.cm. The actual torque shall be adjusted by the steering shroud assembly supplier.

Figure 2-1 provides the schematic diagram of camera installation using 3-ST3.0x8.5 mm screws, showing placement inside the steering shroud.

Figure 2-1 provides a schematic diagram of camera installation by 3-ST3.0 *8.5 mm screws.  
Figure 2-2 illustrates the overall schematic diagram of camera installation.  

2.2 Installation direction.  
The camera is installed in a vehicle with the connector interface oriented horizontally. The angle between the optical direction and the steering column is 0.16°, as depicted in Figure 2-3.  

2.3 Camera optical view angle.  
The camera's viewing angle is defined as FOV H = 66.74°, V = 53.74° @1300 x 1000 resolution. This configuration is sufficient to cover the entire head range of the driver during vehicle operation.
