The testing must ensure a Mileage Target Life of 160,000 km or 10 years, whichever comes first.

**Reference**  
DVP_for Component: VFDSXXDCL0107.

### 3.8 Appearance Approval – Applicable for all Visible Parts
AAR is a PPAP deliverable.  

The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing). For each step of the process, suppliers are responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design, adhering to agreed timelines with VF to obtain OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  

The process begins in the early phase (PT build) to ensure AAR Approval at LS. Suppliers must integrate this activity into their development processes and ED&D Costs.

### 4. Function Safety, Homologation, and Safety Regulations
Safety is a critical factor in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety relates specifically to E/E systems.
