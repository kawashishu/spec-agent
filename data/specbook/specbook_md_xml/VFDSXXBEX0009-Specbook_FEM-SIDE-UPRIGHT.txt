</page>

<page number="19">
3.5 Material requirement and corrosion.

Prohibited or Restricted Substances, Emissions & Toxicology.  
The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification have to be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier through the complete product life cycle according to VFDST00007601.  
IMDS material data sheets have to be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID according to the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and VFDST00007601.  
Specific targets on vehicle indoor air quality are defined according to VFDSXVCVC3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline.

### Corrosion requirements and classifications:
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very high corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.  

### Additional Material Requirements:
- Material combinations shall be chosen so no galvanic corrosion occurs (includes fasteners and attached brackets). Proper coatings (paint, plastic coatings, insulating spacers) must be added in case of critical material combinations.  
- Avoid water and dirt accumulation—always provide drainage at the lowest positions.  
- Avoid dirt traps—sand can act as an abrasive and damage painted body surfaces by micro movements.  
- Contact surfaces to the body should be dry, large enough for low pressure, made of non-abrasive material, and minimize micro-movement.  
- Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

### Corrosion Tests:
The parts must pass both system/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests.

#### **Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:**  
Salt spray test: ISO9227 (Acceptance criteria: see below).

#### **Component Test for Organic Coatings:**  
Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B (Acceptance criteria: see below).

#### **Alternative Tests:**  
Alternative tests proposed by the supplier must be accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test Criteria:
| **Area**              | **Corrosivity** | **Metallic coatings**       | **Organic coatings**     | **Pass criteria**     |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|

| High/not visible for customer   | High           | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227     | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust      |

**Note:** Additional criteria related to CCT tests must be referred to separately.
</page>

<page number="20">
Cycle B.

High/visible, very high corrosivity:  
- 720 h NSS → ISO 9227.  
- 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B.  
- Stone-chipping protection where needed.

**Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:**  
- **Rust creep according to ISO4628-8:**  
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.  
- **Blistering:**  
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  
- **Edge corrosion:**  
  - ≤ 10%.  
- **Weld seam corrosion:**  
  - ≤ 5%.  
- **Degree of rusting:**  
  - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).  

**Stainless steel:**  
- Avoid direct contact with other metals (to prevent galvanic corrosion). In most cases, insulating coating is needed.  
- Test criteria for high visible parts:  
  - 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check especially areas with crevices.
- Execute component tests with assembled sub-systems where possible and in positions as installed on the vehicle.  

**Aluminium parts:**  
- Aluminium parts in high visible areas must be painted or anodized.
- Test criteria for Painted Aluminium: Refer to test criteria for organic coatings.

</page>

<page number="21">
Acceptance criteria: no surface defects.  
Also: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.

### Electric parts
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.  
Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.  
Electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  
Terminals and connectors: Do not place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is first of all a requirement for tightness. Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  
Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.  
Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Reason: Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.  

### Prevention of stone chipping issues
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:  
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.  
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help prevent severe issues.  
- In areas of high stone-hitting risk, choose part materials and paint with the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.  
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.  
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle, deepen them so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.  

### 3.6 Traceability
For part requirements follow specifications — please refer to VinFast standard VFDST00010501.  

### 3.7 Labeling of Parts
Supplier must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. A figure is required to indicate the position of the label on the part.
</page>

<page number="22">
3.8 Vehicle Architecture.
The complete vehicle must pass the requirements from the vehicle layout plans. All changes on parts and modules, which affect the vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence of the vehicle, must be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation. The definition and technical geometric specifications regarding complete vehicle dimensions, interior, and exterior are based on GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.

Styling Technique Convergence:
Changes on parts and modules affecting the exterior and/or interior styling surfaces of the vehicle must be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for evaluation. The supplier must provide part or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops (e.g., tooling demands, assembly sequence) based on defined requirements from VinFast module leads. Technical input can be provided in formats such as office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.

3.9 Vehicle Safety.
Cooperation with VinFast vehicle safety department:
