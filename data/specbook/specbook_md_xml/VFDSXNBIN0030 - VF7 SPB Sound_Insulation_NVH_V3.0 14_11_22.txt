### 6 Average Transmission Loss Value for the Roof NVH

The random incident absorption coefficient values for the Roof NVH have been measured per SAE J2883 standards. These values outline the absorption coefficient performance across a wide range of frequencies:

**Absorption Coefficient Values per Frequency (Hz):**
- At 400 Hz, the SAC value is 0.20.
- At 500 Hz, the SAC value is 0.30.
- At 630 Hz, the SAC value is 0.40.
- At 800 Hz, the SAC value is 0.50.
- At 1,000 Hz, the SAC value is 0.70.
- At 1,250 Hz, the SAC value is 0.90.
- At 1,600 Hz, the SAC value is 1.00.
- At 2,000 Hz, the SAC value is 1.05.
- At 2,500 Hz, the SAC value is 1.05.
- At 3,150 Hz, the SAC value is 1.00.
- At 4,000 Hz, the SAC value is 0.95.
- At 5,000 Hz, the SAC value is 0.87.
- At 6,300 Hz, the SAC value is 0.82.
- At 8,000 Hz, the SAC value is 0.87.
