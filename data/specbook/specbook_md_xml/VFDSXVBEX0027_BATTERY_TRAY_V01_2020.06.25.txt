5 Description and scope of work.

5.3 Material requirement & Corrosion.

- **Stainless steel:** Avoid direct contact with other metals to prevent galvanic corrosion; insulating coating is typically required. High visible parts must pass a 720-hour NSS ISO 9227 test without surface change, particularly in crevice areas. Sub-system component tests should be conducted in their vehicle-installed positions.

- **Aluminium parts:** Aluminium parts in visible areas must be painted or anodized. Painted Aluminium follows organic coating test criteria, while Anodized Aluminium must pass 480-hour NSS ISO 9227 without surface change. Sub-system component tests should also be conducted in their vehicle-installed positions.

- **Chromed metal parts:** Must meet a 240-hour NSS ISO 9227 test without base material corrosion.

- **Chromed plastic parts:** Subjected to the CASS test (DIN EN ISO 9227) for 48 hours (Exterior) or 24 hours (Interior). Acceptance criteria include no surface defects. Also, a 240-hour NSS ISO 9227 test for surface defects must be passed.

- **Electric parts:** Electrically functional units in enclosed casings or boxes must be ventilated through moisture-resistant membranes in wet locations. Material combinations must avoid galvanic corrosion with noble metals such as steel, copper, stainless steel, brass, and conductive rubber. Corrosion-resistant treatments on fasteners and brackets must be fully compatible with other materials. Electrical components must also be installed to prevent vibrations from causing fretting corrosion.

5 Description and Scope of Work.

5.1 Technical Requirement.

Terminals and connectors should not be placed at the lowest points to prevent corrosion damage. Corrosion protection for terminals is primarily achieved through ensuring tightness and protecting electrical connections from humidity.

Grounding surfaces in corrosive environments must be water-tight to prevent degradation. Aluminium alloys containing copper and iron content greater than 1% should be avoided for sealing surfaces due to their susceptibility to corrosion, which could compromise sealing integrity and allow moisture ingress.

### Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues.
To minimize damage from stone chipping, design measures should include:
- Providing shielding parts for easily damageable areas.
- Enlarging radii in high-risk areas to reduce severity.
- Using part materials and paint with the same color to avoid visible abrasion marks in high-risk impact zones.
- Avoiding designs with edges pointed towards the vehicle's driving direction.
- Integrating chromed styling elements in lower vehicle regions to prevent them from being easily impacted by stones.

5.4 Traceability.

Specifications for part requirements are outlined in VinFast standards VFDST00010502 and VFDST00010501. Suppliers should adhere to these standards to ensure compliance.

5.5 Labeling of Parts.

All parts must be labeled according to VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Suppliers must create visual figures showing the proper label placement on the components.

5.6 Vehicle Safety.

### Cooperation with VinFast Vehicle Safety Department.
Suppliers are required to actively support the integration of vehicle safety functionalities. Compliance with applicable laws, market ratings, and OEM requirements relevant to product lifetime must be prioritized.

**General Demands:**
- Safety functions must be thoroughly defined and prepared at the system level through expertise, CAE, and testing.
- Project-related supplier data should be provided to VinFast freely upon request and can be shared within the project framework.
