</page>

<page number="9">
3.6 Labeling of Parts.

Suppliers must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Suppliers are required to create a figure demonstrating the position for sticking labels on parts, including setup details with pictures.

3.7 Testing and Validation and DVP&R.

Testing and validation responsibilities follow RASIC. DVP (Design Verification Plan) includes both virtual and physical testing for systems, subsystems, and components at all relevant levels in line with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase. Detailed test plans for hardware tests must be documented in the DVP&R file and coordinated with the Testing & Validation department. Test specifications include:

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for All Visible Parts.

AAR (Appearance Approval Report) is a PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) deliverable. The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401, detailing quantity of parts and timing. Suppliers are responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design within agreed timelines for OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR approval. This process starts in the early PT build phase to secure AAR approval at LS. Suppliers must incorporate this activity into their development process and ED&D costs.

4 Function Safety, Homologation and Safety Regulations.

Safety plays a crucial role in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety is focused on electronic/electrical systems.

4.1 Functional Safety Requirements.

The supplier must ensure that the developed and manufactured parts comply with the IATF 16949:2016 standard (Quality management system requirements for automotive production). Additionally, compliance with ISO 26262:2018 (Road vehicles - Functional safety) is mandatory.
