5.1 System concept.

CodeBeamer ID: SPB-189515  
Status: New  

The ADAS system developed for VFe35/e36 is designed to provide driving assist functionality up to level 2 of automation, as defined by SAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers (https://www.sae.org/). The system is intended to assist drivers in enhancing driving and road safety. However, it is important to note that the ADAS system is not designed to drive the vehicle autonomously at any time. Drivers are fully responsible, must remain alert, and are required to maintain control of the vehicle at all times. Misuse of ADAS functions by drivers may degrade the system's performance. Drivers must have a complete understanding of the operational principles and rules of the ADAS system whenever they enable it or expect assistance from it. Compliance with local traffic rules is mandatory for drivers.  

Figure 4-1 illustrates SAE levels of driving automation.

The ADAS systems for VFe35 include the functions listed below and their allocation to various ECUs. There are three separate ECUs:  
- **SCAM ECU**: Connected to MRGEN ECU, managing forward-looking traffic functions.  
- **Quanta ADCU**: Responsible for parking and low-speed monitoring functions.  
- **Hella ECUs**: Managing corner radar functions.  

These three ECUs host all ADAS functions and communicate with one another via FD HS CAN. SCAM and ADCU are integrated into the vehicle network through CHS, PT, and INFO CAN. ADAS sensors are connected to ADCU via private CAN lines.

The ADAS system configuration is described as shown in Table 3. In particular, VinFast designated part number, usage per car, procurement code, part applicability on vehicle variants of VFe35. Furthermore, the ADAS functions associated with particular hardware components are also linked. Each component is associated with its function via colour coding. The number of components is indicated next to the function location. Safety-rated ASIL levels for components and functions are also shown. All part information is managed by unique company ID with an EEPxxx format.

6 Complete ADAS system functional arbitration.

CodeBeamer ID: SPB-189702.  
Status: New.  

As there are a number of features interacting with each other, feature arbitration shall be defined with consideration of safety, functionality, and performance. The following matrix defines complete feature prioritization:

**Feature prioritization criteria:**  
- **H:** Feature A has higher priority; Feature B will be inhibited to be active.  
- **E:** Both features can coexist. Neither Feature A nor Feature B shall be inhibited to be active.  
- **L:** Feature B has higher priority; Feature A will be inhibited to be active.  
- **M:** There is no predefined priority between their activations, but whichever is active first will inhibit the other one.  
- **NC:** NOT CO-EXIST.

7 EE architecture for ADAS system.

CodeBeamer ID: SPB-189703.  
Status: New.  

The Electrical and Electronic (EE) architecture for the ADAS system is presented in a detailed arbitration matrix. The matrix categorizes interactions between various ADAS features and specifies their prioritization rules based on safety, functionality, performance, and compatibility. Interactions are defined as follows:  

- **High (H):** Feature A has higher priority, and Feature B will be inhibited from being active.  
- **Equal (E):** Both features can coexist; neither Feature A nor Feature B will be inhibited.  
- **Low (L):** Feature B has higher priority, and Feature A will be inhibited from being active.  
- **Medium (M):** No predefined priority exists; the feature that is activated first will inhibit the other.  
- **Not Co-Exist (NC):** The features cannot coexist or operate simultaneously.  

The matrix visually illustrates the prioritization settings for features across categories, including:  
- High-Level features (e.g., Highway Assist, Auto Lane Changing).  
- Longitudinal features (e.g., Forward Collision Warning, Adaptive Cruise Control).  
- Lateral features (e.g., Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keeping Assist).  
- Emergency systems (e.g., Advanced Automatic Emergency Braking).  
- Parking features (e.g., Remote Parking, Fully Automated Parking).  
- Standalone systems (e.g., Driver Monitoring System, Traffic Sign Recognition).  
 
This comprehensive matrix serves as the functional arbitration framework ensuring safe, optimized, and integrated operation for the ADAS system on VFe35/VFe36 vehicle platforms.

This diagram demonstrates the bus architecture utilized in the VFe35 BEV PLUS variant. It illustrates the connectivity among various components, including ADAS, SAS (EPS1/EPS2), IPC TBox, MDU, HUD, and BCM. The diagram uses color-coded paths to show data flow, signal transmission between modules, and CAN networks.

**Figure 6-4 EE architecture of VFe35 BEV ECO variant.**  
This visual represents the EE architecture for the VFe35 BEV ECO variant. Similar to the PLUS variant, it details the connections and pathways amongst multiple modules, such as ADAS, IPC TBox, SAS, HUD, and BCM. Data flow is indicated using colored lines correlating to various networks such as CHS_CAN500K, Body-CAN500K, and HV_CAN500K.

Both figures highlight the modular architecture and differing setups depending on the vehicle variant, emphasizing the integration of the ADAS into the overall vehicle system.

### XII.1 - ADAS VFe36  
This diagram presents the Electrical and Electronic Architecture (EE architecture) for VFe36 vehicles. It visually describes the integration of the ADAS system components, including driver monitoring systems, sensors, modules, and communication networks. Specific connections are shown between the main ADAS unit, sensors (front and rear), and major network nodes such as BCM (Body Control Module) and VCU (Vehicle Control Unit). Interaction points across sensors, modules, and external interfaces ensure coordinated functionality for ADAS features within the system.

Calibrating ADAS sensors is a precision process that is frequently complex and time-consuming. Some sensors can be calibrated in a repair shop, others require that a vehicle be driven, and many sensors call for both procedures. Calibration is required whenever a sensor or its mounting bracket is fixed initially. Most ADAS sensors are very precisely aimed and require calibration if their positions are disturbed in any way.
