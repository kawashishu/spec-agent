### **8 Deliverables**

#### **8.1 Technical Deliverables**  
Work Interface Chart (RASI): The main supplier obligations are described in the RASI. The supplier status (“System Development Supplier”) is defined in the System/Component Specification.  

RASI is defined as follows:  

**R: Responsible**  
Responsible for executing activities to fulfill requirements. Entitled to request necessary support from other project team members.
