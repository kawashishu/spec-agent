6 Supplier responsibilities.  
The supplier is responsible to provide and ensure completion of assigned work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to mitigate the risk of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

### Customer service requirements.  
**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
Spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall ensure the life cycles of the project and meet requirements in GTC after VinFast’s end of production of the vehicle, except as specified in the SPB.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly must provide VinFast’s after-sales engineering department with information regarding the design, usage, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes:
- BOM table,
- Parts structure and function description,
- Fault diagnosis,
- Special tools for maintenance,
- Relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearance and parts performance).
