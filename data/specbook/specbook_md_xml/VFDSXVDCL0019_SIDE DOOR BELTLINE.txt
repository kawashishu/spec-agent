5.1.1 Project Requirements.

**Quality Requirements.**  
Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements.” The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed. Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging and logistic specifications, etc.).  

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.

Allowing for all of the tolerances which may occur in components and assemblies (BIW door assembly, glass and pillar covers), the beltline molding must remain firmly perfect ergonomic opening and closing of the door in its defined on-body location. The components are to be laid out such that the functions in connection with and to the adjacent systems are ensured.

- The system/the component should remain firmly attached over at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.  
- Should be designed for high-volume production.  
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime.  
- Emit no disturbing noises.  
- Should remain firmly attached over 100,000 open-close cycles on the front door and 50,000 cycles on the rear door.  
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.  

**Additional Requirements.**  

**Certification.**  
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product, and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing.

### 5.1 Technical Requirement  

#### 5.1.1 Project Requirements  
##### Quality Requirements  
Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements”.  

The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.  

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.  

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging and logistic specifications, etc.).  

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.  

Allowing for all of the tolerances which may occur in components and assemblies (BIW door assembly, glass, and pillar covers), the beltline molding must remain firmly perfect for ergonomic opening and closing of the door in its defined on-body location.  

The components are to be laid out such that the functions in connection with and to the adjacent systems are ensured.  

- The system/the component should remain firmly attached over at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.  
- Should be designed for high-volume production.  
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime.  
- Emit no disturbing noises.  
- Should remain firmly attached over 100,000 open-close cycles on the front door and 50,000 cycles on the rear door.  
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.  

##### Additional Requirements  
###### Certification  
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing, and component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved via the PPAP process.  
- Component/subsystem integration and certification are the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. The supplier must complete all component/subsystem tests.  
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.  
- In any event, the supplier is obligated to complete all specified test requirements.  
- The component/subsystem supplier must provide VINFAST's product release engineer with a complete component/subsystem test certification plan approved by the engineer. The plan shall include at least: the number of samples, the test sequence, the place, and the time of each test.  

#### 5.1.2 General Description of the System / Component  
It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.  

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers based on this specification have to be agreed upon between the department creating the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.  

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process to achieve:  
- System-specific requirements.  
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of the markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.  

For technical proposals that exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time schedule.  
The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.  

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all legal requirements of selling markets acting or known with a fixed release date on the date of homologation on the Class B and C common platform. VINFAST shall also monitor ongoing changes to rating protocols to ensure the achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.

5.1.16 Geometrical Integration

**RPS (Reference Position System):**  
The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. A RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts must happen among the RPS-system VFDST00000011 [34] according to the interior and BIW department.

**Tolerance Analyses:**  
Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single components and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:  
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses  
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms  
- Thermal expansion has to be considered  

**Standard Information:**  
- **GB15743-1995:** Car side door strength  
- **GB/T 10125:** Corrosion resistance test  
- **QC/T29087-1992:** Dimension tolerance is not noted in the welding process  
- **QC/T714-2004:** Shape and position tolerances of outer covering parts of welded assembly

**Corrosion Requirements**

**General Categorization:**  
For the determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosively position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosively Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosively Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosively:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosively:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

**Corrosion Tests:**  
The parts must pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

**Component Test For Metallic Surfaces:**  
- **Fog Test:** ISO6270 CH (Acceptance criteria detailed below)  
- **Salt Spray Test:** ISO9227 (Acceptance criteria detailed below)
