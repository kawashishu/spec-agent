3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.  
AAR is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing).  

For each step of the process, the supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VinFast to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  

The process will start in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS. Suppliers must include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.  

4 Function Safety, Homologation and Safety Regulations.  
Safety is one of the key issues in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety is concerned with E/E systems.  

4.1 Functional Safety Requirements.  
- The supplier shall ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet IATF 16949:2016 standard, Quality Management System requirements for automotive production.  
- The supplier shall ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet ISO 26262:2018 standard, Road Vehicles - Functional Safety.

**4.3 Homologation and Safety Regulation Requirements.**  

**4.3.1 North America.**  

*a. Homologation and Safety Regulation Activities.*  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations such as European standards, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation required to be submitted to the relevant authorities.  

*b. Self-Certification and Test Report(s).*  
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requires suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  

The supplier should also become familiar with the laboratory test procedures used by the USA/Canada governments to evaluate product compliance against each FMVSS/CMVSS. (*Refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer Handbook.*)  

*c. Duty to Notify VinFast of Non-Compliance.*  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. Suppliers must notify VinFast of the issue.

</page>

<page number="10">
The Supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on non-compliance issues with the UN-ECE regulations within five working days after determining the existence of such non-compliance or safety-related defects. The Supplier must propose a risk assessment and resolution plan.
