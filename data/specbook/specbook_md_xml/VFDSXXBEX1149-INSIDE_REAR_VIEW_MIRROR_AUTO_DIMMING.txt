3.2.1 Component / System Description.

An inner rearview mirror (IRVM) is a part of indirect vision devices that provides a clear view of the rear of the vehicle to the driver, within the driver's field of vision. The rear view is achieved through a mirror glass. The reflectivity of the mirror glass can be controlled via an EC cell behind the glass to reduce glare to the driver caused by traffic behind. A sensor integrated into the mirror measures the incoming light intensity and controls the dimming function accordingly.

This system operates as an FSS (Full Service Supplier), meaning the supplier assumes complete responsibility for the supplied system within its designated boundaries. The supplier is required to deliver the parts as fully integrated modules, including all relevant add-on parts.

**Functional Responsibility:**
All parts of the assembly must be matched accurately to ensure compatibility. Functional dimensions must strictly adhere to prescribed requirements.

**Weight Target:**
The target weight for the mirror assembly should not exceed 600 g.

**System Development Requirements:**
The system developer must design all technical solutions and meet requirements based on available vehicle and design data during the design process. This includes:
- Ensuring the component requirements are met.
- Compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to the selling markets.

**Mandatory Documentation for Release:**
The following sheets and documents must be provided as part of the release:
- Drawings (2D, 3D).
- Simulation results, including mold flow analysis and NVH studies.
- Quality regulations.
- Results and documentation of test validation.
- Documentation and evidence of DVP (Design Validation Process) and FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis).
- Electric and Electronics component data sheet and specifications.
- Electric and Electronics block diagram.
- Material Data Sheet outlining materials used.

**Supplier Obligations:**
The supplier must submit a detailed timing chart outlining a clear project plan. This chart must be consistently updated to ensure consistent progress control and be provided during quotation submission. Additionally, supplier quotations must include a detailed component and process cost breakdown.

COLOR & MATERIAL INTERIOR SPECBOOK  

### 3.2.2 Functions  

#### 3.2.2.1 Main Functions  
- Provide indirect view of the rear traffic.  
- Adjust the field of view for different seat positions.  

Mirror assembly will be attached to the windscreen. The supplier is responsible for defining and developing the attachment. Attachment should be robust enough to prevent NVH and also meet Head Impact requirements.  

#### 3.2.2.2 Component Functions  

**1. Reflective Surface**  
The IRVM shall allow the driver to see rear traffic via a reflective surface. The IRVM shall fulfill all legal requirements for all applicable markets. It shall also be adjustable to ensure proper vision for all drivers.  

**2. Environment Brightness and Rear Light Detection**  
Sensors to measure the environment brightness and incoming light from rear traffic that might disturb the driver are to be included. The measured data should be communicated to the outer mirror for controlling the auto-dimming function of the outer mirror.  

**3. Auto Dimming**  
Auto Dimming can automatically dim and clear the Mirror Glass according to ambient and incident light levels, thereby reducing glare. Output from the Inner Mirror (IRVM) is a 1.1-1.4V, 49Hz PWM signal with a variable duty cycle of 0% - 100%. The supplier is responsible for providing an additional control unit if required. Variable levels of dimming shall be possible.
</page>

<page number="13">
3.2.2.3 Interfaces  
The components must be designed to ensure functionality in combination with all adjoining systems and interfaces.  

The concept will be defined during the engineering phase between the Supplier and VinFast. The Supplier will develop fixation and function of the Inner Mirror System using provided input and will report any deviations from the process.  

The Supplier will analyze and integrate additional elements necessary for the Assembly, Orientation, and Fixation of the Inner Mirror System.  

The interfaces must be developed in cooperation with VinFast and with consideration of a quality method such as FMEA.  

Measures must be taken to prevent contact corrosion, particularly when various metallic materials are used.  

Care must be taken to ensure the snug fit of parts even in the case of unfavorable tolerances of the components or surroundings.  

**Relevant module interfaces:**  
- Windscreen  
- Sensor Farm Area (Windshield Camera + Covers + Brackets)  

---

3.3 NVH & Driving Comfort  

**General:**  
The VINFAST target system for the Inner Rear View Mirror (IRVM) is oriented toward reference vehicles. The gas and water tightness are essential for achieving acoustical tightness and must be appropriate and sufficiently achieved.  

All possible measures must be taken to prevent disturbing sounds (e.g., relative movement, squeak and rattle, temperature, flexural torsion) during operation. Wind noise and whining noise must be completely removed or deadened to the greatest possible extent to ensure acceptable performance.  

**Squeak and Rattle Effects:**  
Disturbances such as squeak and rattle (S&R), especially during high-speed driving or at specific humidity levels, are to be avoided by using suitable profile designs and high-quality material pairings with appropriate surface coating processes.  

The NVH team may assist in material pairing selection to prevent the generation of buzzing, squeak, or rattle noise.  

**Seal System Considerations:**  
All seal system components must be designed to reduce aerodynamic resistance and optimize aeroacoustic characteristics.  

Testing Requirements:  
Noise freedom must be confirmed through coordination with the NVH-testing team.  

**Natural Frequency:**  
To achieve subjective targets, low vibration at maximum speed must be ensured. The 1st eigenfrequency of the mirror assembly must exceed 55Hz, as measured on the trimmed body.
</page>

<page number="14">
The supplier has to guarantee:
• No amplification of vibrations on inner mirrors.
• Avoiding of noise caused by the function of components or by joints due to unfavorable tolerances.
• No whistling, buzzing, squeaking and rattling noises during high speed driving.
• All the functions must be fulfilled over the whole operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).

### 3.4 General CAE Requirements
Refer to SOR:
- **VFSRXXCVC0201 VFCAE-001-FEM-GENERAL_Analysis requirement**

### 3.5 Material Requirements
#### Prohibited or Restricted Substances, Emissions & Toxicology
The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification have to be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier through the complete product lifecycle according to **VFDST00007601**.

IMDS material data sheets have to be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID according to the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and **VFDST00007601**. Specific targets on vehicle indoor air quality should adhere to **VFDSXVCVC3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline**.

All the materials described are proposals from VINFAST. The system supplier is responsible for definition and confirmation of all materials.

Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and **Part 1: General Project Requirements** for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

#### Corrosion Requirements
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In cases of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).

Avoid water and dirt accumulation and always provide drainage in the lowest positions.
</page>

<page number="15">
Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements.

Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.

Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

### Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass System/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

#### Component test for Metallic surfaces:
**Salt spray test:** ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.

#### For Organic coatings:
**Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B**, acceptance criteria see below.

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

#### Test criteria:
| Area                           | Corrosivity       | Metallic coatings             | Organic coatings               | Pass criteria                |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low           | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227         | 96 h → ISO6270 CH              | No red rust                 |
| Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, Wet area | Medium | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227         | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust            |
| High/not visible for customer | High             | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227         | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust, CCT: See below |
| High/visible, very high        | Very high        | 720 h NSS → ISO 9227         | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B + stonechipping protection where needed | NSS: No red rust, CCT: See below |

#### Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:
- **Rust creep according to ISO4628-8**: 
  - Galvanized steel: \(d ≤ 4\ \text{mm}\).
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: \(d ≤ 1-2\ \text{mm}\).
- **Blistering:** Blister size max. \(S2\) (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).
- **Edge corrosion:** ≤ \(10\%\).
- **Weld seam corrosion:** ≤ \(5\%\).
- **Degree of rusting:** ≤ \(Ri 1\) (according to ISO4628-3).

For stainless steel:
- Pass criteria remains subject to additional evaluations as deemed necessary.
</page>

<page number="16">
Avoid direct contact with other metals to prevent galvanic corrosion; insulating coating is often necessary. Test criteria for high visible parts require 720 hours of salt spray testing per ISO 9227 without surface changes, with emphasis on areas with crevices. Component tests should be conducted with assembled sub-systems in installed positions.

### Aluminium Parts
Aluminium parts in high visibility regions must be painted or anodized. Painted aluminium follows organic coating test criteria, while anodized aluminium undergoes 480 hours NSS ISO 9227 testing without surface change. Tests should be executed on assembled sub-systems in installed positions.

### Chromed Metal Parts
Chromed metal parts must endure 240 hours of NSS ISO 9227 testing without base material corrosion.

### Chromed Plastic Parts
Chromed plastic parts are subjected to CASS tests per DIN EN ISO 9227:  
- **Exterior**: 48 hours duration  
- **Interior**: 24 hours duration  
Acceptance criteria include no surface defects and an additional 240 hours NSS ISO 9227 testing without defects.

### Electric Parts
Electrically functional casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as control units, must include moisture-resistant membranes (e.g., Gortex) for wet conditions. Material combinations must avoid galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and brackets. Protective surface treatments should ensure long-term corrosion resistance compatible across materials. 

Electrical components must minimize vibration to prevent fretting corrosion. Terminals should not be placed at low points and must provide tightness to protect electrical connections from humidity. Grounding connections in corrosive environments must be waterproof.
</page>

<page number="17">
3.8 Operational Strength (Stiffness / Strength / Durability)

- Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions (operating loads and special events).
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile.
- Definition of all requirements to ensure sufficient operational strength of complete vehicle, sub-systems, and components (this technical specification is the basis for all system and component technical specifications).
- Mounting force must be lower than dismounting force.

**Operating Loads:**

Operating loads occur during the intended use of the vehicle, derived by measurements with benchmark base vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast. The definition of customer usage is based on VinFast for MCE (mixed circuit Europe = long-distance durability run). The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car, which is 160,000 km. 

**Vehicle Lifetime:**  
The vehicle lifetime shall be at least 10 years.

**Environmental Operating Conditions:**  
- -35°C to +90°C ambient.  
- 0 - 100% relative humidity.  
- -100m to 3500m above mean sea level.
</page>

<page number="18">
### Special Events:
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking. The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.  

### Misuse Events:
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., kerbstone impact. The vehicle must be dimensioned to ensure:
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or at neighboring components (principle: "deformation before break").  

### 3.9 Appearance Approval - Applicable for All Visible Parts:
Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing).  
- For each step of the process, the supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  
- The process will start in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS.  

Suppliers must include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost. Additionally, Skull Cap & Base Cover visible parting lines need to be eliminated or reduced to the maximum extent.

# Testing and Validation

## 4.1 Test plan

The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the FSS SUP has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of his component has the FSS SUP. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on committed schedule. The FSS SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the FSS SUP site or their testing centers.

Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast/FSS SUP. If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedure, the testing has to be redone at the costs of FSS SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting has to be paid by FSS SUP if they are responsible for the failure.

### Data to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- No. of tested components/parts.

The FSS SUP is responsible to use the draft DVP&R provided by VF testing department. The initial data filling has to be done by the FSS SUP and has to be submitted to VF (at least 4 weeks after the nomination of the FSS SUP).

The FSS SUP has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart) and serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.

The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the FSS SUP. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department (VF), SQA (VinFast), and the FSS SUP before concept confirmation. After this approval, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the FSS SUP has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, the FSS SUP draws up a test plan for each single component.

The FSS SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the FSS SUP site or their testing centers.

Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast and the FSS SUP. If testing was done with incorrect parts, missing parts, or an inappropriate testing procedure, testing must be redone at the FSS SUP's expense. In case of negative test results, retesting must be planned and expenses borne by FSS SUP if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data must be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- Description of testing set-up (including pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Location of testing (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of testing (presented in a project plan format).
- Part variant and description.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The FSS SUP is responsible for utilizing the draft DVP&R provided by VF testing department. Initial data must be submitted by the FSS SUP to VF no later than four weeks after its nomination.

The FSS SUP has to develop a DVP for each development stage, including the prototype and serial stage (if specified in the master timing chart). Testing sequence and specimen numbers are to be determined in collaboration with VF validation engineers and lead engineers.

The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by VinFast departments and the FSS SUP. The DVP&R must be approved by the VF test department, SQA, and FSS SUP before concept confirmation, with weekly reviews post-approval. Scheduling delays must be countered with proposals from the FSS SUP to fulfill commitments.

Upon request, the FSS SUP must prepare a test plan for each individual component.

4.2 Test plan example.
The DVP must be updated weekly to include the designated points by the supplier.

4.3 General.
The FSS SUP must prepare a detailed, backdated testing plan in alignment with the vehicle timing chart.

The worst-case component/system variant must always be tested. To avoid redundant testing, mechanical and electrical tests should be combined whenever feasible.

The Supplier must download VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC. Development parts or partial body structures needed by FSS SUP for testing must be included in the quotation and ordered through VinFast.

Unless expressly agreed, a measurement report for every sample part must accompany the delivery. Test activity parts required by VinFast testing department must be supplied by FSS SUP free of charge.

The component developer must ensure compliance with all relevant legislation and VinFast internal requirements outlined in the performance specification.

All tests must include documented results with photo evidence, submitted to VF. All regulations of applicable target markets must be met.

Documentation standards must follow VinFast standards or, if accepted, FSS SUP standards. Evaluations and executions of tests must cover all development phases per specifications.

Tests must be presented in the required DVP&R template as an appendix to the quotation with sample inspection timing coordinated with the test department.
</page>

<page number="21">
4 Testing and Validation.

4.1 Test plan.
The test plan regulates who will conduct testing, when it should be done, and which testing devices are required. Results must be presented clearly, and the progress of testing must be monitored continuously. If VinFast requests verification of test results, the supplier (FSS SUP) must provide the necessary parts free of charge. The procedures and documentation associated with testing must receive approval from the validation engineer and component lead engineer at VinFast. The test plan must be updated weekly or amended as new information emerges due to development changes.

The FSS SUP is responsible for the complete safeguarding of its component. The testing must be scheduled in advance to allow approval or re-testing in case of failures within the agreed-upon timeline. The FSS SUP must provide relevant test protocols/reports to VinFast for verification and allow VinFast staff to attend tests at the supplier's site or testing centers. Any deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast and the FSS SUP.

If testing is performed with incorrect parts, missing components, or using a non-compliant testing procedure, those tests will need to be repeated at the supplier’s expense. If test failures are discovered, retesting must also be done at the supplier’s cost.

The DVP&R must include:
- Testing procedures aligned with standards, norms, and legal requirements.
- Descriptions and visual documentation of the testing setup.
- Responsible test department details.
- Information on where the testing took place (internal or external).
- Duration and timeline of the testing.
- Description and variant of the tested part(s).
- Quantity of tested components/parts.

The FSS SUP must utilize the draft DVP&R provided by VinFast's testing department. Initial data must be filled out by the supplier and submitted to VinFast within four weeks after the supplier's nomination. A DVP must be planned for every development stage, prototype, and serial stage according to the master timing chart. Testing sequences and specimen requirements must be planned in collaboration with validation engineers and component lead engineers at VinFast, with the test plan co-approved by relevant VinFast departments and the supplier. Regular weekly reviews must confirm adherence to the DVP&R schedule or identify delays, with the supplier offering proposals to maintain timelines.

Upon request, the supplier must draft an individual test plan for component testing.

4.2 Test Plan Example.
The DVP must be weekly updated to include specific data points by the supplier. 

4.3 General.
The FSS SUP prepares a detailed, backdated testing plan in alignment with VinFast's vehicle timeline. The worst-case component/system variant must always be tested. Efforts should be made to combine mechanical and electrical tests to avoid redundancy.

Suppliers must access VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal. Development parts or partial body structures needed for testing must be included in the supplier’s quotation to VinFast and ordered by VinFast.

Measurement reports must be provided alongside each sample part upon delivery. Parts required for testing at VinFast facilities must be provided free of charge by the supplier. Component developers must ensure compliance with all relevant legislation and VinFast performance specifications. All test results must be documented and presented in the required format (photos included).

The FSS SUP must evaluate and execute necessary tests according to specifications for all development stages, with results documented in DVP&R templates attached to the supplier’s offer. Samples must be provided punctually or by agreed dates to allow for coordinated inspection by the test department.

4.4 Release by Test Departments.
VinFast's test department will approve components only after agreed test targets are met by the supplier during complete vehicle integration tests. The supplier must submit test reports indicating positive results for all required tests. If issues arise, the supplier must provide detailed reports, participate in follow-up discussions, and propose solutions to ensure milestone and target adherence. Test reports must clearly state whether results are OK or NOK.

4.5 Analyses and Test Reports.
The FSS SUP must provide electronic measurement reports with agreed measurement concepts for all parts during prototype phases. Each test sample must undergo detailed analysis upon completion of its test.

Test data must include measurements verified through specific values and documented in a report to be delivered to VinFast for approval. Test results and documentation from initial inspections or parallel development inspections must assist progress decisions. Tests associated with series production must align with scheduled intervals or specific requirements.
