2 General Document Guidelines.

2.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.  
This version is legally binding.  

This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard.  

Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g. what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g. level 3 vs level 2, level 2 is applicable).  

2.2 Language.  
This document is written in English.  

All official project documentations must be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.  

2.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.  
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.  

- **Shall**  
  The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.  

- **Should**  
  The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.  

- **May**  
  The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

### General Project Guidelines

#### 3.1 Development Scope Abstract
This document details the technical requirements of the short-range radar (SRR) used by VinFast in VF8 Base.  
The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics.  
The contractor ensures that the development of the components respect all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements.  

Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details must be reported immediately.  
The contractor is a "System Development Supplier" with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.  

#### 3.2 Initial Situation and Objective
The objective is to provide all the necessary technical information required to develop an SRR for VinFast cars.  

#### 3.3 Classification of the System / Component  
##### 3.3.1 Millimeter Wave Radar Sensor  
Millimeter wave (mmWave) is a special class of radar technology that uses short-wavelength electromagnetic waves. Radar systems transmit electromagnetic wave signals that objects in their path then reflect. By capturing the reflected signal, a radar system can determine the range, velocity, and angle of the objects.  

---

#### 3.4 Execution Regulations  
The supplier must ensure that the developed parts meet the requirements of applicable laws and specified requirements by VinFast. Suppliers need to obtain type certification of the parts and submit all necessary documents to support the type certification of the whole vehicle. When synchronous development is completed, suppliers are required to provide documentation proving their compliance with regulatory requirements.  

##### Table of Relevant Standards:  
- **ISO 20653:** Degrees of protection provided by enclosures (IP Code).  
- **ISO 16750.1:** Road vehicles — Environmental conditions and testing for electrical and electronic equipment — Part 1: General.

### 6.3 SRR Functions

#### 6.3.1 Short Range RADAR  
The Master and slave SRR detect obstacles located at the rear of the vehicle by transmitting microwaves. These microwaves, upon encountering obstacles, are returned and converted into electrical signals. The signals are sent to the SRR Master located on the right side. The SRR Master processes the data and calculates the obstacle positions and distances.  

Once relevant distance and position information is obtained, this data is transmitted through the CAN bus to the instrument cluster and HMI. The HMI speaker provides an audible alarm, while the HMI displays the obstacle information.  

The system includes a self-checking function. Whenever a fault is detected, an audible alert is triggered, and the corresponding fault is displayed on the HMI.

7. Testing and Validation and DVP&R.
DVP and PC test responsibility follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for System, Subsystem & Component Level inline with Complete Vehicle Specification book in the concept phase. Detailed test plan for hardware tests in file DVP&R and need work with Testing & Validation department:

- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

7.1 Proof of Compliance.

7.1.1 Testing Plan (DVP+FRS Plan).
Refer to data from the T&V team:  
VF8 DVPRXVEEP9295_DVPR_SRR-M-VF8Base.

7.1.2 Vehicle Testing.  
1. Vehicle Alarm Function Test.  
Primarily through integrating the DBC communication matrix, various alarm scenarios were simulated to monitor whether the alarm signals met the expected criteria. Details are provided in the BSD test report.

2. BSD Test.  
Primarily, the motion trajectories of the ego-vehicle and the target vehicle were simulated to confirm whether radar detection was normal and whether the alarm met the customer’s requirements. Details are provided in the BSD test report.

3. Calibration Test.  
Primarily focused on confirming whether site calibration and after-sales dynamic calibration functions met the customer’s requirements. Details are provided in the SRR test report.

8 SRR Calibration.

8.1 Radar supports EOL calibration and after-sales (AS) calibration.  
1. In the production line or AS change of a new radar, AS calibration will start automatically.  
2. In the plant, turning on the hazard light for at least 5 seconds will initiate EOL calibration, regardless of whether the hazard light is on.  
3. Once the EOL calibration starts, it should be finished within 80 seconds; otherwise, the time-out function will trigger, reverting the process to AS calibration. To restart EOL calibration, turn on the hazard light again for 5 seconds.  
4. In the AS market, send a clear command by OBD for the following scenarios:  
   - The radar has already been calibrated but requires recalibration due to movement or re-installation.  
   - Radar has an angle error DTC resolved by staff.  

**Note:** If a new sample does not receive any trigger commands, it will automatically undergo after-sales calibration.  

The specific calibration process is illustrated in the accompanying figure.

8.3 EOL calibration triggering Mechanism

The EOL calibration triggering mechanism is visually represented using a flowchart. It outlines the processes for both End-of-Line (EOL) radar installation and after-sales radar installation. The mechanism operates through various triggers such as hazard light activation and OBD commands, followed by calibration processing, status readings, and problem-solving steps. Key decision points include the calibration timeout duration (80 seconds), calibration status, and result values against standard thresholds. Successful calibration results are stored, while failures result in diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and corresponding error storage.
