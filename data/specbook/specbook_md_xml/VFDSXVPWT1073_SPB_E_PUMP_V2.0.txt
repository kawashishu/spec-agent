Vehicle Documentation Systems or components that fulfill safety regulations of authorities or legal requirements must be remarked on the drawings. The reasons and the characteristics which must be documented are listed by authorities.  

These demands will be requested during the development of the part and by the latest in the PTO phase.

5. Description and scope of work.

**5.1 Technical requirement.**  
This specification establishes the technical cooling module requirements for the BEV electric pump.  

It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.
</page>

<page number="7">
The system developer commits to developing all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design-process to achieve the purpose of the project. The technical and commercial release will be handled by the customer according to change management.

For BEV vehicles, thermal management electric pumps are an essential component of the cooling system. The goal is to have a validated electric pump for BEV variants that support E-motor cooling, power electronics, and HVAC.

### 5.2 System Description
Electric coolant circulation pumps are one of the key auxiliary devices used for cooling powertrain components and accessories, including cabin heating and electronic circuits cooling. The aim is to gather product portfolio information to enable a well-informed selection of e-pumps required for BEV applications.
</page>

<page number="8">
5.3 Package layout overview.

Complete vehicle is still under development. Use dimensions provided as reference to confirm technical feasibility and provide initial quotation. More accurate dimensions/envelops will be provided once they are available.

The system designer has to coordinate all components of the module in relation to: Packaging, Function, Fixing, and tolerances.

Dimensions shown are for reference, defined based on BEV layout. The objective is a compact design, taking into account the overall low cost and acceptable quality. It is the responsibility of the supplier to confirm the most cost-effective alternative(s) for each variant.

5.3.1 Function.
The coolant pump is subjected to:
- Operating temperatures ranging from –30°C to +100°C.
- Pressure loss in system 0.3 to 0.9 bar (Pump loss not included).
</page>

<page number="9">
- Operating Voltage: 12V.  
- Communication: PWM.  
- Pump coolant flow rate must range between 8LPM to 25LPM.  
- All pumps must be robust in construction with quiet operation.  
- The pump must provide a fixation method as well as mounting points to the vehicle. The pump fixing strategy must be defined by the supplier.  
- The electric and hydraulic connections must be adapted individually as per requirements.  
- Each pump must be designed to operate continuously at maximum efficiency with the coolant. The pump should preferably be non-overloading with a continuous rising head characteristic from design point to shut off.  
- The selected motor must suit the pump’s operational requirements. The motor input KW must be at 120% of the designed capacity (rated).  
- The pumps and motors must be free from undue vibration and capable of withstanding stresses during startup, normal operation, and tests.  
- Components must withstand water spray and, in some cases, water splash from wheels and be submerged in water during wading.  
- Earth and positive connections must be situated in a dry and clean area or withstand water, dirt, and snow. Sensitive parts and electrical connections must be watertight.  
- Pumps must be OBD2 compliant to support the US market.  
- Pumps must be delivered with brackets for fixation.  

### 5.3.2 System Requirements  
System suppliers must define characteristic curve/values matching thermal and electrical requirements from HVAC and high-voltage components. Pump selection will be based on coolant type and characteristics.  

The following requirements must be fulfilled:  
• Geometry.  
• Acoustics, vibrations, resonances.  
• Life due to the operational profile.  
• Service and ease of repair.  

**Characteristic Curves:**  
Suppliers must provide characteristic charts. Pumps must be tested to plot the characteristic curves, such as capacity against head, power, and efficiency.

### 5.3.4 Interfaces

The components must be designed in a way that functionality is guaranteed in combination with all adjoining systems and interfaces. Below is an overview of major interface points:  
- Coolant Lines  
- Electrical connection  
- Pump mounting brackets  
- BIW (clearances, packaging, resonances, stiffness)  
- E drive motor  
- Chassis (clearances to chassis components, e.g., fuel system, braking system, piping, etc.)  
- Complete vehicle performance targets  

The system must be able to withstand ambient temperature variations from -30°C to 40°C and corrosive environments. Additionally, it should endure all types of road load conditions as well as moderate violence from reckless driving on poor roads or under off-road conditions.  

The most significant interfaces are the pump mounting and fixation strategy as they influence pump positioning and clearances with its surroundings. Supportive interfaces improve durability, static and dynamic behavior, and tolerance stack-up.  

**Weight Management:**  
The system mass should be less than 0.5 kg.

Detailed test plans for hardware tests in file DVP&R must involve collaboration with the Testing & Validation department. Testing requirements include:  
- Declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirements.  
- Description of testing setup and devices used, supported with pictures.  
- Identification of where the testing was performed (internal/external).  
- Duration and timelines for testing, presented in the form of a project timeline.
