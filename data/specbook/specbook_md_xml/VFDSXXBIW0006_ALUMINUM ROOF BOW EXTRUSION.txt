It must be ensured that at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification. Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification are to be agreed between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.

For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of the supplier, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time-schedule.

The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of selling markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class D and C common platform.

VINFAST shall also monitor ongoing changes of rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.

For the documentation of the release, the following sheets and documents are necessary:
- Quality regulations  
- Results / documentation of test validation  
- Documentation of the DFMEA  

All parts of the assembly must be matched to each other. Functional dimensions must be fulfilled according to the prescription.

The supplier must ensure that the developed parts comply with PRC regulations and VINFAST specifications, obtain component type approval, and submit all necessary documents to support vehicle type approval.

Upon completion of the synchronous development, the supplier shall provide the necessary documentation to prove that its products have met the promised regulatory requirements.

The parts shall be in accordance not only with the drawings and specifications listed here, but also with any additional requirements on the SOR. Any items in the drawings, specifications, and SOR may be changed in the future, and the parts shall be in accordance with the changed requirements.

The main supplier obligations are described in the work interface chart (RASI). The status of the supplier ("Built to Print" or "System Development Supplier") is defined below System/Component Specification.

RASI is defined as followed:
- **R: Responsible**
  Responsible for proper execution of the activities to fulfill the requirements. She/he is entitled to request the necessary support from other project team members.
- **A: Approval**
  Obligation to decide/responsible for release. If no decider is defined, the person who is responsible for execution R is the decider.
- **S: Support**
  Obligated to provide active support (even if this requires capacity, expenses, and/or transfer of know-how). This project team member must proactively assist the person responsible for execution R in achieving the targets.
- **I: Information**
  Right to information. This team member is entitled to demand information from R.
