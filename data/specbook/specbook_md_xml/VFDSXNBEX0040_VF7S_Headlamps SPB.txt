### Serviceability
Timing targets for the serviceable lamp at the dealership.

### Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions

#### Description of the Part:
The feature list provides useful information. Regions where the product is used, such as the UK, Australia, South Africa, Japan, and other right-hand drive countries, should follow the low beam pattern specific to those regions. It is essential to identify whether the product is used in ECO or PLUS variants.

#### Functional Requirements:
Front headlamps (comprised of left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH)) are part of the exterior in the lighting commodity for VF7 (VF34). The headlamps are mounted to the front bumper upper panel and to the fender.

Two variants of front headlamps exist for ECO and PLUS models, used across various markets (ECE, VN, and NAS), making a total of four variations:
- ECO (NAS)
- ECO (ECE, VN)
- PLUS (NAS)
- PLUS (ECE, VN)

For regions such as the UK, Australia, South Africa, Japan, and other right-hand drive countries, headlamps should follow the right-hand drive low beam pattern.
