### 5 Description and scope of work

#### 5.6.2 Triggering Time and Airbag Inflation Time
The triggering time or 'time to fire' (TTF) refers to the deployment time determined by the Airbag Control Unit (ACU). Pending the type and severity of the impact, the ACU sends out triggering voltage to the airbag(s).

The inflation time refers to the duration required for the airbag to be triggered by the ACU, reach its restraint position, and achieve full inflation. The minimum required inflation time for the VF35/e35 airbag modules is as follows:

**VN Airbag System:**
- **Driver Airbag Module (DAB):** TTF + TBD milliseconds (ms)
- **Passenger Airbag Module (PAB):** TTF + TBD ms
- **Side Airbag Module (SAB):** TTF + TBD ms

System and Vehicle Testing Activities.

In addition to the Component Level Testing Activities for the restraint system modules listed in Section 6, it is crucial that System and Vehicle levels of testing activities are conducted to facilitate the development outlined in Sections 5.6.1 to 5.6.4. The work contents are frequently categorized into:
i. Virtual Testing Activities or Computer Aided Engineering (CAE).
ii. Sled Testing Activities.
iii. Full Vehicle Crash Testing Activities.

The findings from these testing activities confirm the airbag requirements on module and system levels, the effectiveness of protection coverage, and Time to Fire (TTF) for specific load cases, typically dictated by high-speed impacts (Front and Side). Once the testing activities confirm these requirements, the airbags are installed into the vehicle and validated with Physical Full Vehicle Crash Testing Activities. Following confirmation through testing, this document will be updated accordingly.

**Figures:**

System and Vehicle Testing Activities.

Beside Component Level Testing Activities of restraint system modules listed in Section 6, it is important that System and Vehicle levels of testing activities are conducted to support development as outlined in Sections 5.6.1 to 5.6.4. These testing activities are divided into three categories:
i. Virtual Testing Activities or Computer Aided Engineering (CAE).
ii. Sled Testing Activities.
iii. Full Vehicle Crash Testing Activities.

The results from these activities confirm the airbag requirements at the module and system levels, including protection effectiveness and Time to Fire for load cases dictated by high-speed impact (Front and Side). Upon validation, the system will be installed in the vehicle, with further Physical Full Vehicle Crash Testing Activities conducted. This document will be updated to reflect the findings from testing.

7.3 Homologation and Safety Regulation Requirements.
The supplier must ensure homologation compliance for their parts, products, or systems concerning North American regulations.

7.3.1 North America.
a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.
Suppliers must meet regulations such as FMVSS and CMVSS and ensure submission of required documentation to authorities.

b. Self-certification and test reports.
Suppliers are responsible for certifying compliance before product sales and providing evidence through test reports.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance.
Suppliers must inform VinFast if they detect any FMVSS, CMVSS, or European regulatory non-compliance.
</page>

<page number="16">
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

### 7.3.2 Europe

#### Homologation and safety regulation activities
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.

#### Test report(s) and Certificate(s)
The supplier is responsible for getting their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain parts of the UN-ECE at authorized technical service(s). The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.

VinFast also requests that suppliers provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings to be submitted to the relevant authorities to gain certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any). The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

#### Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
