7 Supplier responsibilities.

The supplier is responsible to provide and ensure efficient completion of designated work. Supplier responsibilities are listed to mitigate the risk of establishing an employer-employee relationship under the contract.

**Customer service requirements.**

**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The supplier must ensure the support period for after-sales spare parts aligns with the life cycle of the project and the requirements in the General Terms and Conditions (GTC), even after VinFast ends production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this Supplier Package Book (SPB).

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly must provide the VinFast after-sales engineering department with the necessary information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes details such as the BOM table, parts structure and function descriptions, fault diagnosis protocols, special maintenance tools, and relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearance and parts performance specifications).

8 Intellectual Property / Copyright.

Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).

9 Insurance / Warranties.
