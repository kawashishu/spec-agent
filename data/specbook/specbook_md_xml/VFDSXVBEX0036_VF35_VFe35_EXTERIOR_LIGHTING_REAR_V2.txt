Material Requirements & Corrosion.

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. Corrosivity Low: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. Corrosivity Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. High Corrosivity: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. Very High Corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. 
- Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. For critical material combinations, proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).
- Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in the lowest positions.
- Avoid dirt traps, where sand can act as an abrasive and may damage the painted body through micro movements.
- Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, provide low pressure, and be made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.
- Ensure burr-free edges and use a paint system with good edge coverage.

Corrosion Tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests, as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

### Component test for Metallic surfaces:
- Salt Spray Test: ISO9227 (acceptance criteria see below).

### For Organic Coatings:
- Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B (acceptance criteria see below).

Alternate tests may be proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test Criteria:
| Area | Corrosivity | Metallic Coatings | Organic Coatings | Pass Criteria |
|------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 96 h → ISO6270 CH | No red rust |
| Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, wet area | Medium | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust |
| High/not visible for customer | Medium | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | CCT: See below |
| High/visible, very high | Very High | 720 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B + Stonechipping Protection where needed | |

### Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings after CCT:
- **Rust Creep** according to ISO4628-8:
  - Galvanized Steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1–2 mm.
- **Blistering:** Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).
- **Edge Corrosion:** ≤ 10%.
- **Weld Seam Corrosion:** ≤ 5%.
- **Degree of Rusting:** ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

### Stainless Steel Guidance:
- Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion), in most cases, insulating coating is required.

### Test Criteria for High Visible Parts:
- 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check areas with crevices.
- Execute component test with assembled subsystem where possible, installed in the vehicle's position.

### Test Criteria for Aluminium Parts:
- Aluminium parts in highly visible areas must be painted or anodized.
  - Painted Aluminium: Refer to test criteria for organic coatings.
  - Anodized Aluminium: 480 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.
- Execute component test with assembled subsystem where possible, installed in the vehicle's position.
</page>

<page number="16">
Chromed metal parts must withstand 240 hours of NSS testing according to ISO 9227 without base material corrosion.

Chromed plastic parts are required to pass the CASS test according to DIN EN ISO 9227. The test duration is 48 hours for exterior components and 24 hours for interior components. Acceptance criteria include no surface defects. Additionally, chromed plastic parts must also pass 240 hours of NSS testing according to ISO 9227 without surface defects.

Electric parts must adhere to the following requirements:
- Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes must be ventilated using a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (e.g., Gortex) when installed in wet locations.
- Material combinations must be selected to avoid galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and attached brackets.
- Direct contact with noble metals like steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, or conductive/anti-static rubber in wet environments must be avoided. Surface treatments on steel fasteners must provide long-term corrosion resistance and compatibility with adjacent materials.
- Electrical components must be positioned to prevent fretting corrosion caused by vibrations.
- Terminals and connectors should not be placed in the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for ensuring tightness, as electrical connections must remain protected from humidity.
- Grounding surfaces must be water-tight if located in a corrosive environment.
- Aluminium with copper and iron content exceeding 1% should be avoided for sealing surfaces due to high corrosion sensitivity, which can compromise the seal and allow moisture ingress.

**Prevention of stone chipping issues:**
To minimize the risk of damage caused by stone chipping on bodywork and related parts, the following design measures must be implemented:
- Provide shielding components wherever applicable to protect easily damageable parts.
- Enlarge radii of parts in high-risk areas to reduce the severity of impacts.
- Use materials and paints with the same color in high-risk areas to conceal abrasion marks effectively.
- Avoid developing components with edges facing the vehicle’s driving direction.

## Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them, so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.  

## Test Plan
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.  

### Test Procedure and Documentation
The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or when new data/information due to development changes is needed.  

### Responsibility for Safeguarding 
The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of their component lies with the SDS. Testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The SDS has to ensure that VinFast receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast and SDS.  

### Retesting Conditions
If testing is done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the tests must be redone at the cost of SDS. In case of negative test results, retesting has to be re-planned and paid for by the SDS if they are responsible for the failure.  

### Required Data for DVP&R
- Testing with declaration of the standard, norm, and legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and timeline of the testing (in the form of project plans).
- Part variant and description of part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The DVP&R must be agreed upon between T&V (VinFast), SQA (VinFast), and the SDS before concept confirmation. After concept confirmation, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. In case of scheduling delays, the SDS must submit proposals to fulfill the committed schedule. Upon request, the SDS will create a test plan for each component.  

### Failure Analysis
Any failure in the tests conducted by VinFast will result in an analysis of the root cause. If the failure is attributed to the supplier, the supplier must take full responsibility, and VinFast will support issue resolution. Suppliers are free to attend centralized tests.

12 Appearance Approval Process.

The Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is applicable to suppliers supplying components affecting CMF appearance that require VinFast Approval prior to PPAP deliverables. This report verifies that the VinFast Design Quality team has inspected the final product and it meets all the required appearance specifications for the design. Harmony review is significantly important to ensure the components' quality or state of being homogeneous with adjacent parts.

Design Quality requires all suppliers to submit non-commercial value sample parts. Suppliers are required to submit complete assembly parts known as purchase parts (P-level) and child parts known as component parts (D-level). The quantity of parts to be submitted is outlined in document VFDST00038401 for details.
