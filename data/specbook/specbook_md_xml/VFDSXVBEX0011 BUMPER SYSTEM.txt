5 Description and scope of work.

5.1.1 Radar Cover.

Material Properties:
Material properties provided by the manufacturer typically refer to frequencies in the MHz range and below. At higher frequencies, the material properties differ significantly from the data sheets. The material roughness should be less than or equal to lambda/10 (≤ ~400 µm).

Materials used in the bumper or secondary surface structure should exhibit the following properties:
- Synthetic materials with low dielectric loss factors at the specified radar frequency to achieve low transition damping.
- Synthetic materials with low dielectric constants (εr) to ensure minimal surface reflection.

Painting:
The secondary surface can be painted; however, comprehensive analysis and control of potential painting categories are essential to prevent substantial performance degradation.

Typically, the secondary surface involves multiple layers of primer, paint, and varnishes. These layers, combined with structural material, affect both surface reflection properties and transmission damping. All metallic materials degrade or block sensor radiation and should not be used as a secondary surface.

The use of elements containing metallic particles requires verification. The applicability of metallic paints is dependent on:
- The percentage of metal content in the paint.
- The size and shape of the metal particles in the paint.
- The number and thickness of various paint and primer layers.

The maximum number of painting layers must not exceed four, considering their one-way attenuation limits.

### 5.2 General CAE Requirements
For detailed CAE requirements, please refer to Appendix 2 titled "CAE-FEM-GENERAL" in the VinFast Statement of Requirement (SOR) Specification Book. The document outlines finite element modeling requirements necessary to support the VinFast SOR. This information is intended exclusively for Project VINFAST and must not be reproduced, distributed, or shared without express authorization. Rights are reserved under applicable laws, and offenders may be held liable for damages.

### 5.3 Material Requirements & Corrosion
VinFast material and corrosion requirements refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation (RFQ) and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC.

#### Corrosion Classification
Corrosivity positions for system components are classified as follows:
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Positions not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road salts (deicing agents).
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Positions moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road salts.
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default classification for exterior positions directly exposed to road spray.
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default classification for positions affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

#### General Material Guidance
- Exterior vehicle areas are considered high corrosivity zones.
- Materials must prevent galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and brackets. Apply coatings such as paint or plastic insulation to critical combinations.
- Design systems to avoid water and dirt accumulation by providing effective drainage at the lowest positions.
- Prevent dirt traps to minimize damages from abrasives caused by micro movements.
- Ensure burr-free edges with adequate paint coverage, particularly on edges susceptible to abrasion.
- Contact surfaces must remain dry. Use durable, non-abrasive materials with sufficient pressure absorption to avoid deformation or damage during application.
- Prioritize minimizing micro movements to ensure structural integrity.

Edge protection and materials design must fulfill these specifications to meet VinFast's standards and durability expectations for automotive components.

### Electric Parts:
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when located in wet environments.

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.  

Avoid direct contact with more noble metals, such as steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber, in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.

#### Terminals and Connectors:
Do not place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness: electrical connections must be protected from humidity.

#### Groundings:
Grounding connection surfaces must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.
