5.1. Technical requirement  

5.1.1. Project Requirements  

5.1.1.1. Quality Requirements  
Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements”.  

The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.  

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.  
Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistic specifications etc.).  

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.  

The components are to be laid out such that the functions in connection with and to the adjacent systems are ensured:  
- The system/the component should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000km, whichever comes first.  
- Should be designed for high-volume production.  
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime (unless activated).  
- Be fully functional as part of the active hood system when sensors are triggered.  
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.  

5.1.1.2. Certification  
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product, and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing, and component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.  
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. Supplier must complete all component/subsystem tests.

5.1.5.13. Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization.

To ensure a cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) must be provided through the diagnosis interface or central data interface for pyrotechnical components. Compliance with the following requirements is necessary:
- Enable sequential deployment of all components to avoid noise and pressure peaks and allow for component deployment checks.
- Ensure that no solid combustion residues remain after deployment; residues shall not be classified as toxic waste or hazardous substances per valid waste legislation. Otherwise, the components must be dismantled and disposed of separately.
- Successful deployment of pyrotechnical components must be immediately and clearly visible—either acoustically, directly at the vehicle, or through feedback at the deployment tool.
- Clearly mark positions of pyrotechnical components, including hidden components like battery safety terminal clamps and active safety headrests.
- Non-deployed pyrotechnical components must be removed, and pre-dismantling should be avoided if technically possible, ensuring accessibility of fasteners.

5.1.5.14. Recycling.

### Recycled Materials
Material selection must focus on reducing material variety and compatibility with available recycling procedures (proven recycling technologies). 
Secondary raw materials such as post-consumer recyclables and post-production recyclers (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fibers, recycled textiles, and foams) must be prioritized based on market availability. Recycled materials must be marked according to established parts marking standards and reported to VINFAST’s environmental compliance expert team.

### Recycling Scheme
Components must be designed for cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The recycling scheme must:
- Include a simple layout for the recycling process and information about preferred recycling partners.
- Provide cost estimations. 
- Be submitted to VINFAST’s environmental experts before the PTO Production Try-Out milestone.

5.1.5.15. Geometrical Integration.

The classification relies on the RPS (Reference Position System). This testing range classification occurs in the functional area. The main goal of the determination concept is ensuring consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. A clear RPS concept is expected.
</page>

<page number="15">
5.1.5.13. Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:
