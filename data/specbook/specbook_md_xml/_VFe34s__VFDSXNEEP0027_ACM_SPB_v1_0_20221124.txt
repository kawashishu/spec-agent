###### 5.3.1.1 Purpose  

- The purpose of the airbag control unit (ACU) and peripheral sensors (satellites) is to detect a vehicle impact and release the restraint system, i.e., airbags, belt pretensioner, etc., in case of frontal, side, and rear collisions and vehicle rollover. For certain markets, airbag suppression due to the presence of children or absence of passengers is enabled by ACU. Post-crash functions, including door unlock, battery cutoff, warning light, etc., are initiated. Additionally, ACU monitors the status of the belt buckles for the seatbelt reminder function.  
- ACU is equipped with an internal acceleration sensor and provides the interface to satellite sensors. Its functionality includes self-monitoring and diagnostic functions. ACU is configurable for safety and country-specific requirements, as well as option code-relevant functions.  
- The satellite sensors connected to ACU provide signals for crash recognition, based on physical principles such as acceleration and pressure.  

###### 5.3.1.2 System Overview  

The airbag system includes ACU, ignition circuits, satellite sensors, belt buckle switches, and the SBR mat. The number of squibs depends on the vehicle variant.

### 5 Functional and Technical Requirements

#### 5.3 Functions

##### 5.3.1 Overview Functions Description

###### 5.3.1.1 Purpose
- The purpose of the airbag control unit (ACU) and peripheral sensors (satellites) is to detect a vehicle impact and release the restraint system (e.g., airbags, belt pretensioner) in case of frontal, side, and rear collisions as well as vehicle rollover. For certain markets, airbag suppression due to the presence of a child or absence of passengers is enabled by the ACU. It also initiates post-crash functions (door unlock, battery cutoff, warning light, etc.) and communicates and monitors the status of the belt buckles for the seatbelt reminder function.
- The ACU is equipped with an internal acceleration sensor and provides the interface to the satellite sensors. The functionality includes self-monitoring and diagnostic functions. It is configurable for safety, country-specific requirements, and option code-relevant functions.
- The satellite sensors connected to the ACU provide signals for crash recognition based on physical principles (acceleration and pressure).

###### 5.3.1.2 System Overview
The airbag system includes the ACU, ignition circuits, satellite sensors, belt buckle switches, and the SBR mat. The number of squibs depends on the vehicle variant.

#### 5.3.2.6.1.2 Functional Description
The Seat Belt Warning feature alerts the driver when any vehicle occupants, including the driver, fail to buckle their seat belt. It detects unbuckled seat belts in occupied seats and provides two levels of driver alerts:

1. **First Level Warning:** Activated visually when the power mode is ON (Driver Present state) and any occupant’s seat belt is not fastened.
2. **Second Level Warning:** A visual and audible warning activated when the vehicle speed exceeds 25 km/h and the safety belt is unbuckled, based on the relevant seating position requirement.

The seat belt warning uses a seat belt warning symbol (SWS) displayed on the MDU and an audible chime played through the IPC speaker. The MHU operates the SWS and chime based on ACM requests. The blinking frequency is set to 1Hz, and the chime is synchronized with the blinking.

5.9 Installation.  

The supplier shall support in generating a feasible concept and solution for the installation of the ECU and associated sensors to the vehicle. The supplier shall provide detailed guidelines to the CAD packaging team since this component has specific packaging and handling requirements. This section shall be updated after a fixing solution is confirmed and 3D CAD data is frozen.  

5.9.1 Installation Location.  

The AMC ECU should be ideally installed on the floor of the vehicle on the tunnel, in a central location near the front of the vehicle. However, this position can be changed due to packaging constraints but a central location should still be maintained. In VFe33 and VFe34 vehicles, this happens to be under the front row seats. The mounting location of the ECU is shown in the figure below:  

*Figure: The mounting location under the front row seats is highlighted to indicate the installation position of the ECU on the vehicle floor.*  

5.9.2 Assembly Concept and Requirements.  

The part has an arrow showing the driving direction and as such should be installed parallel to the arrow shown. It is to be secured using 3 nut bolts such that the part should not be movable after tightening the bolts with the correct torque requirements provided on the drawings and in the detailed guidelines by the supplier. The assembly method is shown in the figures on the next page.
</page>

<page number="48">
5.9.2 Assembly Concept and Requirements.

Great care should be taken while handling the ACM ECU and during its assembly. If the ECU is accidentally dropped, then it cannot be fitted to the vehicle as it would have damaged the sensors inside. Always secure the ECU first in its location and then tighten the bolts. Then connect it with the harness before supplying power. Once power is supplied, make sure that the ECU is protected from accidental impacts since this may cause the airbags to be deployed causing excessive injury and damage to operators/technicians working on the vehicle. For details please refer to the document (40227087_SPE_000_AG_Install_Guide_ACU.pdf) provided by the supplier.
