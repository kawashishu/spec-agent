**Function**  

#### Requirements:
Most important functions of door trim:
- Covering of DIW and other systems according to styling requirements, considering targets of legal/market requirements.
- Tightness against water, air leakage, dust.
- Noise absorption.
- Absorbing properties in case of side impact.
- Integration of add-on parts.
- Providing full functionality over lifetime.

#### Overall Function:
Primary targets for the development of the ASM door trim are:
- (Content incomplete or not provided in raw text).
</page>

<page number="15">
Avoidance of functional and qualitative problems from known systems. Use of standard parts and common parts where possible and convenient. Process reliability in manufacturing, packaging, transport, and assembly. Minimize effort of overall production sequence: production, packaging, transport, and assembly on the line. Prevention of displacement Integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of the part package (Simultaneous Engineering) from the concept phase onward. Early inclusion of the developers of neighboring components (body shell, inner side finisher, etc.). General reduction in cost as compared to predecessor model. Further improvement of the acoustic, optical and functional characteristics. Functionality has to be ensured within temperature range -30° (-5° for Vietnam market) till +85°C. Support of side airbag performance. Support of sound performance. Fulfilling ergonomic requirements. Sufficient clearance between door trim and seat adjustment devices min 70 mm.

**Stiffness / rigidity / stability of shape**  
Especially in the area of the operating elements, the door trim assembly has to assure that no instability is noticeable. Irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, visible waviness under climatic change loads are prohibited.

**Door trim requirements**

Avoidance of functional and qualitative problems from known systems. Use of standard parts and common parts where possible and convenient. Process reliability in manufacturing, packaging, transport, and assembly has to be ensured. Minimize effort of the overall production sequence: production, packaging, transport, and assembly on the line. Prevention of displacement integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of the part package (Simultaneous Engineering) from the concept phase onward. Early inclusion of developers of neighboring components (body shell, inner side finisher, etc.) is required. A general reduction in cost as compared to predecessor models is necessary. 

Further improvement of acoustic, optical, and functional characteristics is targeted. Functionality must be maintained within the temperature range: -30° (-5° for Vietnam market) to +85°C. Components must support side airbag performance and sound performance while fulfilling ergonomic requirements. Sufficient clearance between door trim and seat adjustment devices—minimum of 70 mm—is mandatory. 

### Stiffness / Rigidity / Stability of Shape
Especially in the area of operating elements, the door trim assembly must ensure that no instability is noticeable. Irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, visible waviness under climatic change loads are prohibited.

### Door Trim Requirements
No detaching, fracturing, or splitting of parts is allowed during crash tests or airbag deployment, even at low temperatures.

### Materials
- Components must follow material and production-compliant design principles to avoid production flaws such as tool parting points, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, and stress zones.
- Material-compliant fits, curvatures, and corners must allow visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces.
- Uniform, proportionally accurate, and material-compliant run-out of edges, corners, and ribs is required.
- Concepts and production methods should facilitate homogeneous surfaces and grain structures.
- Visible screw points, screw covers, and dummy covers must be avoided.
- Surfaces must be free of burrs in visual and haptic zones.
- It should not be possible to recognize components through grilles, trim covers, indentations, joints, or cavities. The overall impression must be neat and tidy.

### Additional Surface and Material Requirements
- Correct material pairing, surfaces, and connections must be ensured to avoid disturbance noise.
- Surfaces should be free of disturbing noise and odor and designed according to ISO 1302 standards.
- The tightness of door panels must prevent uncomfortable airflow to passengers.

### Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:
To ensure a cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, the recycling function for pyrotechnical components must adhere to the following:

1. Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoiding noise and pressure peaks and verifying each deployment).
2. After deployment, pyrotechnical components should not leave solid combustion residues that would be classified as toxic waste or hazardous substances. Non-compliant components must be dismantled separately as hazardous substances.
3. Deployment of pyrotechnical components must be visibly successful (acoustic feedback, visual feedback, or deployment tool feedback).
4. Mark positions of pyrotechnical components (including concealed ones such as battery safety terminal clamps or active safety headrests).
5. Ensure removability of pyrotechnical components in cases of non-deployment, avoiding pre-dismantling where technically feasible.

---

### Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT:
- **Rust creep according to ISO4628-8:**  
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1–2 mm.  
- **Blistering:** Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  
- **Edge corrosion:** ≤ 10%.  
- **Weld seam corrosion:** ≤ 5%.  
- **Degree of rusting:** ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

---

### Guidelines for Interior Areas:
The interior is generally considered a dry area, which translates to low corrosivity. Exceptions may include floor areas or spots exposed to wetness or abrasion by shoes or drinks.  
When combining different metals, avoid galvanic corrosion by coating the parts.
</page>

<page number="34">
Edges, especially painted edges, shall be burr-free for good edge coverage and avoiding wear.

At least new seat structure components made from uncoated (blank steel) must be corrosion-free, and areas with corrosion risk must not be visible to the customer. Consider extreme positions of the seat-rests. For other invisible areas, test criteria may be lower than mentioned, but it must be ensured that no corrosive products appear in visible areas, and all functions over the lifetime must be assured.

**Vehicle tooling:** Usually stored in the trunk, considered low corrosivity exposure. For tool surfaces with wear, the corrosivity might be medium.

**See also:** Corrosion requirements for electric components.

---

### Test Plan
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be performed and what testing devices are necessary. It displays the results, the visual status, and the progress of testing. The control of test results must be ensured at all times. If VinFast requires verification of test results on its own, SDS must deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. Weekly updates are required during the testing phase or any development changes.

---

### Responsibility
The responsibility for the full safeguarding of components lies with the SDS. Testing must be planned to ensure timely approval and/or re-testing for negative results. SDS must facilitate VinFast’s attendance at testing facilities or provide all relevant protocol/reports. Deviations must be mutually agreed upon by VinFast and SDS. Testing errors due to incorrect procedures, missing parts, or wrong components must be redone at SDS's expense.

Negative test results will require re-planning at SDS's cost.

---

### Data Included in DVP&R:
1. Testing declaration (standard, norm, legal requirement).
2. Description of test setup (devices used, pictures included).
3. Responsible test department.
4. Testing location (internal/external).
5. Time and duration (project plan format).
6. Part variant and description.
7. Number of tested components/parts.

**Note:** SDS must use the VinFast-provided DVP&R template and is responsible for its content.
</page>

<page number="35">
The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart) and serial stage. In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimen are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST.

The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VINFAST departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department VINFAST and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule. Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.

### Testing
#### General
The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart. 

- It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.
- In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.
- Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS have to be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered by the SDS from VINFAST.
- Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.
- Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for only its component. Moreover, it must be guaranteed that all internal VINFAST requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VINFAST.

- All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved.
- All tests must be documented according to VINFAST standard, or alternatively to SDS standard, if this is accepted by VINFAST.
- The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification.
- The tests have to be brought in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.

Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (in coordination with the test department). VINFAST "Logistics" determines the number of sample parts. VINFAST "Purchase" orders the parts.

A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.
</page>

<page number="36">
The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS.

**Release by Test Departments**  
The responsible VINFAST test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved from the SDS and during the complete vehicles integration tests.  
The SDS must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any problems (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the SDS must submit a test report, must be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions (to keep all milestones, to observe all targets, etc.).  
OK or NOK result needs to be stated on the first sheet of the report.  

**Analyses and Test Reports**  
The SDS has to provide measurement reports according to VINFAST specification (VFDST00008900) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts.  
After the individual tests, the test samples have to be analyzed in detail.  
The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report has to be handed over to the responsible VinFast department for release.  
Upon request, the results together with the documentation of the tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development) are to be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests carried out parallel to series production are to be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.  

**Test Report/Information**  
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (part no., change index, materials, production process, additives like grease, and every deviation from the approved serial process).  
- All parts have to be labeled with description.  
- Eventual reason for testing in case of e.g. negative test results and attachment of earlier test reports.  
- Testing with exact naming of testing standard, norm, legal requirement, or exact description of agreed testing procedure.  

**Documentation of Results**  
- Short description of the result (pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of result OK/NOK, pictures of the parts in testing position, etc.).  
- Comparison with targets of the specification book, testing specification, legal requirements.  
- Recommendation.  
- Description of corrective measures or further approach in case of negative test result.   
- Progress of testing status.

### Geometrical Integration
**RPS (Reference Position System):**  
The classification of the testing range occurs within a functional area. The goal of the determination concept is to produce consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly assembly and component testing. A RPS determination concept must be carried out with the quality assurance measures established in the SE process. This concept will serve as the foundation.
</page>

<page number="39">
### Tolerance Analyses
