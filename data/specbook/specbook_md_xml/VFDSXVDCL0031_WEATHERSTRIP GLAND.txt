5 Description and scope of work

5.1 Technical requirement

5.1.1 Project Requirements

5.1.1.1 Quality Requirements  
Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements”.  
The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.  

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.  

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging and logistic specifications etc.).  

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.  

The components are to be laid out such that the functions in connection with and to the adjacent systems are ensured.  

- The system/the component should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.  
- Should be designed for high-volume production.  
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime (unless activated).  
- Be fully functional as part of the active hood system when sensors are triggered.  
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.  

5.1.1.2 Certification  
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product, and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing. Component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.  
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. The supplier must complete all component/subsystem tests.  
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.

Project VINFAST IMDS-ID @ XXXX.

Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary”. The marking consists of brief type designations which have been defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<). 

Material safety data sheets (SDS) according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (incl. national chemical inventory 2017) have to be provided for milestone concept confirmation.

- Removal of pyrotechnical components is required in cases of non-deployment, avoiding pre-dismantling when possible.

5.1.5.15 Recycling:
Recycled materials must be prioritized, emphasizing reducing material variety and compatibility with existing recycling procedures (proven recycling technologies). Secondary raw materials such as recycled polymeric PET fiber, textiles, foams, and thermoplastics are preferred based on market availability. Recycled materials must adhere to parts marking standards defined in the specification book and be reported to VINFAST’s environmental compliance team.
</page>

<page number="16">
Recycling scheme. This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. 

The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling scheme has to be provided to environmental experts’ team at VINFAST before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

Geometrical Integration.

RPS (reference position system): The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. A RPS concept for design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to occur among the RPS system VFDST00000011 [34] according to the interior and BIW department.

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. European, Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS), and Canadian motor vehicle safety standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.

b. Self-certification and test report(s).
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before offering those products for sale. VinFast requests suppliers conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. Test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.

The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate product compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS.  

(*) Refer Appendix 8 of Manufacturer Handbook.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations.
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item they have manufactured.  

The supplier must notify VinFast of such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  

The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

7.3.2 Europe.

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.

b. Test report(s) and Certificate(s).
The supplier is responsible for getting their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before offering those products for sale. VinFast requests suppliers conduct tests as specified in certain UN-ECE regulations at authorized technical service(s). Test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.

VinFast also requests suppliers provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings, to be submitted to relevant authorities to obtain certification for EC vehicle type-approval (if any).
