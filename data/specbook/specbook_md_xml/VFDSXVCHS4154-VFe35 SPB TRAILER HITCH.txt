3 Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions.

* Mounting clearance standard: Comply with UNECE R55 released 15.6.2018.

Figures:
- The towball height must be 21.2mm above the rear-most mounting point.
- The towball height must be between 350mm & 420mm from the ground to the center of the towball when the vehicle is in its laden position. Rear-most mounting point measurements are also indicated.
- Clearance spaces follow the vertical plane and coupling point dimensions, adhering to UNECE R55 limits such as angles, distances, and tolerances.

Illustrations depict:
1. Specific vertical and horizontal clearance dimensions around the towball coupling point.
2. Maximum allowable measurements for angles, distances from the ground, and plane limits to ensure compliance with regulations.
