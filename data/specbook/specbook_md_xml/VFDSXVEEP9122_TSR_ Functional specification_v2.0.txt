According to Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 2021/1958, an intelligent speed assistance system shall comprise a speed limit information function (SLIF) and either a speed limit warning function (SLWF) or a speed control function (SCF). In VinFast project, all three functions are required.  

This document focuses on SLIF and SLWF-related requirements; for SCF requirements, please refer to the Adaptive Cruise Control function specification.  

Relationship between ZF, VinFast, and GSR acronyms is as follows:  

| ZF   | VinFast          | GSR                       |
|------|------------------|---------------------------|
| TSR  | TSR              | SLIF                      |

| ISLC | ISA              | SCF                       |

5.4.3 / / Function configuration and Disclaimer  

Requirement ID: FS-226186  
Type: --  
Status: New  

Function configuration is defined as below:  

1) For VF35 ICE and VF36 ICE: Only use front camera to detect traffic signs and speed limit signs.  
2) For VFe35 BEV and VFe36 BEV: Combine front camera detection and map system information jointly for ISA function (performance requirement from GSR cannot be satisfied only with front camera detection) and only use front camera for TSR function.  

Note that these two functions are only assistance functions and are designed to help drivers maintain a speed below the recommended speed limit and provide traffic sign information. They are not designed to replace the driver observing the traffic signs and obeying traffic rules for the environment they are driving in.  

It is recommended that the OEM deploying such functions makes it clear to the driver either via a disclaimer in the vehicle HMI or vehicle user manual.

For all signs except 'Stop Sign' and 'No Entrance Sign,' their display message shall be sent out once they are driven past by the host vehicle, until the host vehicle has driven the APV_Dis_keep_TSR distance.

For TYPE2 and TYPE3, signal 0x80.ADAS_TSR_Typ2 and 0x80.ADAS_TSR_Typ3, higher signal value holds a higher priority. The current display signal can be terminated by a new signal with a higher value.

0x80.ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value will always show explicit and implicit speed limit value. Typ2 shows the implicit sign (not value) and condition speed limit value. (The speed limit value of 0x80.ADAS_TSR_Typ2=1 to 6 will be sent in 0x80.ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value and 0x80.ADAS_TSR_Typ2, while the other speed limit value of 0x80.ADAS_TSR_Typ2=7 to 12 will be sent in 0x80.ADAS_TSR_Typ2_value and 0x80.ADAS_TSR_Typ2).

**Note:**  
1. Current speed shall be the vehicle display speed (0x40D.MHU_DigitSpeed, always received with KPH unit).

According to the GSR requirements.

<page number="45">
Ÿ System shall use one timer for both acceleration and deceleration.

Ÿ The timer shall be started when the current speedometer speed > 100% of the perceived speed limit, and it shall be reset when the current speedometer speed ≤ 100% of the perceived speed limit.

Ÿ If any of the conditions listed in ID1712 (a), (b), (c), or (d) are met when the timer reaches 3 seconds, the acoustic warning shall be triggered. Otherwise, at the 4th, 5th, and 6th seconds, the system shall repeat checking the conditions in ID1712 (a), (b), (c), or (d) and determine whether to trigger the acoustic warning or not.

Ÿ When the timer reaches 6 seconds, the system shall always trigger the acoustic warning.

**Note**: These requirements mean that every condition shall hold its own timer. If any of these timers expire, no matter whether the vehicle is accelerating or decelerating, the acoustic warning shall be triggered.

The cascaded acoustic warning shall be provided until the speedometer speed is less than or equal to the perceived speed limit or for at least 3.0 seconds after the initial activation of the cascaded acoustic warning.

The acoustic warning shall not last more than 5.0 seconds, even in cases of successive speed limit changes, in order to minimize driver annoyance.

The cascaded acoustic warning shall terminate immediately upon deliberate driver action, such as adjusting the target cruise speed through the SET or SPEED+ or SPEED- button.

#### SET SPEED+/-
- The acoustic warning shall be inhibited once the ISLC function has been activated. 
- For Non-EU countries: If the ISLC function is activated (internal signal from ACC), the acoustic warning shall be inhibited. 
- For EU countries: The acoustic warning shall NOT be inhibited when the ISLC function is active. If the driver manually overrides the ISLC function by increasing the target speed, visual and acoustic warnings shall resume and be ready after the next perceived speed limit.

**Note**: EU countries reference RU 2021/1958 Annex II.

When the vehicle is decelerating due to any of the following events, the cascaded acoustic warning shall either not be provided or terminate immediately:
1. Full release of the accelerator control, except when the driving speed of the vehicle is actively controlled by a vehicle system, or during brief deceleration due to gear selection.
2. Manual disengagement of a vehicle system controlling the driving speed.
3. Activation of the service braking system.
</page>

<page number="46">
1. Activation of an endurance braking system.

After a warning has been terminated, the system shall be prepared to provide the next warning after one or more of the following conditions are applied:
1. The speedometer speed dropped below the perceived speed limit.
2. Reapplication of the accelerator control after the condition in point (a) leading to the termination of warning.
3. Reengagement of the vehicle system controlling driving speed after the condition in point (b) leading to the termination of warning.
4. The perceived speed limit has changed to a lower value.

When the TSR displays the perceived speed limit, even when the speedometer speed is lower than the perceived speed limit, the system shall also provide a subtle and non-annoying audible notification each time when the perceived speed limit changes. (This will be done by MHU.)
