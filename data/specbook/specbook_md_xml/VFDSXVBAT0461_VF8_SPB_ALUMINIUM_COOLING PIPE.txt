**Overview:**  
Batteries work based on the principle of a voltage differential, and at high temperatures, the electrons inside become excited, decreasing the difference in voltage between the two sides of the battery. Because batteries are only manufactured to work between certain temperature extremes, they will stop working if there is no cooling system to keep them in a working range.  

Cooling systems need to be able to keep the battery pack in the temperature range of approximately 20-40 degrees Celsius, while also minimizing the temperature difference within the battery pack (no more than 5 degrees Celsius).  

The battery cooling system consists of a patented serpentine cooling pipe that winds through the battery pack and carries a flow of water-glycol coolant. Thermal contact with the cells occurs through their sides to transfer heat away via a liquid system.

There are three types of Aluminum Cooling Pipes in the Battery Pack VF8.

**Type 1:** MOD11002080_Aluminum Cooling Pipe 10s.  
- The Liquid System is depicted winding through the pack.  
- A serpentine cooling pipe is shown in detail, designed to efficiently transfer heat away.  
- The Aluminum Cooling Pipe component is labeled, demonstrating placement within the assembly.  
- The Inlet-Outlet Port and Thermal Silicone Pad are identified as integral elements of this system, ensuring thermal management and structural support.

Figures above illustrate the configuration and components of the MOD11002080 cooling pipe system within the battery pack.
