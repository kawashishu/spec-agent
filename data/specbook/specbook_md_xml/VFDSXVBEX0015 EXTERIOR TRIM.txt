5.3 Material Requirement.  
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).  

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity.  

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  

- Avoid water and dirt accumulation. Always provide drainage in the lowest positions.  
- Also avoid dirt traps where sand can act as an abrasive and damage the painted body with micro movements.  
- Ensure contact surfaces to the body are dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive materials. Minimize micro-movement.  
- Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.
