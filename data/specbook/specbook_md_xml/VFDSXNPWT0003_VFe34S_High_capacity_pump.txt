### Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions
An electrical pump is utilized to move the coolant from the radiator to essential powertrain components. Through its controller, the pump determines the volume of coolant circulated at given temperature ranges, ensuring target temperature maintenance. The system incorporates two high-capacity electric pumps: one for the battery circuit and another for the EDS circuit.

Refer to drawings PWT71026002 and PWT71026004.

## Vibration durability test:

The elastic support of the pump is used to fix the pump on the vibration testing equipment, and the connecting pipe should be as long as possible. Working conditions include operating at the rated working point. 

**Test procedure:** Sweep the pump in three directions of X, Y, and Z, determine the corresponding frequency of the maximum vibration of the electric pump in the frequency range of 10 Hz-200 Hz, and vibrate 2 million times at this frequency (3 directions in total). 

### Performance curve:
The graphical representation illustrates the water pump's performance curve, showcasing the correlation between flow rate (Q) in liters per minute, differential pressure (ΔP) in kilopascals, efficiency (η), and power (P) in watts.

Air Mixing Test.

Mixing amount is air 20% (1 minute), 14% (1 minute), 8% (1 minute), 2.5% (7 minutes). Test water temperature is 75°C. The test is conducted 5 times and under rated working point conditions. Applied voltage is 13V with a carrying angle of 16 degrees (outlet upward). The test medium is a water/ethylene glycol mixture, and the test pretreatment consists of 10 minutes of dry-running.

Chemical Resistance Test.

Chemical substances are introduced by spraying or brushing the pump wet, then placed for 48 hours at the required test temperature:
1. Organic diesel oil at (140 ±5) °C.
2. E85 fuel (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline) at (23 ±5) °C.
3. Brake fluid DOT at (140 ±5) °C.
4. Coolant additive (undiluted antifreeze) at (140 ±5) °C.
5. Engine oil (compound oil) at (140 ±5) °C.
6. Vehicle cleaner at (140 ±5) °C.
7. Gearbox oil at (140 ±5) °C.
8. Hydraulic oil at (140 ±5) °C.
9. Windshield cleaner at (23 ±5) °C.

Vehicle Safety.

Cooperation is required with the LD vehicle safety department. The supplier is responsible for actively supporting the integration of vehicle safety functions. Part/system CAE models must be provided upon demand to support and meet vehicle data freeze milestones. These models must be implemented within LSDYNA and validated for numerical and physical stability. FE meshes must adhere to homogeneity requirements based on part axles/geometry, with a density of millimeters. Non-compliance with meshing guidelines requires re-work of FE meshes. The supplier must plan, perform, and finance activities for generating validated CAE material cards. This includes tests on the system and components.

Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability).

All requirements are applicable for the respective subsystem unless specified otherwise. The test items listed in the DVP are not exhaustive, as the complete vehicle undergoes numerous functional tests during development. Testing details, evaluation criteria, and loading programs are outlined in the respective testing standards (DVP).

Weight Management.

Vehicle weight significantly influences energy consumption. The primary goal is to minimize the complete vehicle weight. A weight-optimized design must be maintained for all components throughout development. Suppliers are required to propose weight reduction potentials and their impact on cost, timing, and quality. The VFe34 system weight must not exceed 0.6 kg.

Temperatures and Pressures.

The coolant temperature range is -40°C to 125°C. Ambient temperature is 23°C ±5°C. The medium is water/glycol mixture. Medium temperature is 23°C ±5°C. At U =12V ±0.2V, various PWM values are tested to analyze the flow, head, and current at different valve opening degrees.
