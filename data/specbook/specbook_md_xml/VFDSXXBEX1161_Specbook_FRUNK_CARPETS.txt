VFDSXXBEX1162  
DVP_FRUNK_CARPETS  

**3.7.1 Test plan.**  
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times.  

For tests, the B2P SUP is contracted.  

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.  

The B2P SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the B2P SUP site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast and B2P SUP.  

If testing is done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the expense of B2P SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned, and the retesting must be paid by B2P SUP if they are responsible for the failure.  

**Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:**  
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirement.  
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).  
- Responsible test department.  
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).  
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).  
- Part variant and description of the part.  
- Number of tested components/parts.  

The B2P SUP is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by the VF testing department. The B2P SUP has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.  

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. Upon request, the B2P SUP must use a test plan for each single component.  

**3.7.2 Test plan example.**  
DVP has to be weekly updated into following points by the supplier.
</page>

<page number="9">
3.7.3 Testing  
3.7.3.1 General.  

The B2P SUP provides in time a detailed testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart.  
It must be guaranteed, that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.  
In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.  

The Supplier has to download the VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC.  
Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.  

The component developer must assure all relevant legislations for only his component.  
Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VF-requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled.  
All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VF.  
All relevant target market law obligations have to be achieved.  

All tests must be documented according to the VinFast standard, alternatively to B2P SUP standard, if this is accepted by VF.  

The B2P SUP has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for all development phases according to the specification.  
The tests have to be brought in the required DVP&R template (as an enclosure to the offer).  

Samples for sample inspections must be made available on time or no later than the agreed date (in coordination with the test department).  

In order to coordinate the form and the surface, corresponding samples have to be presented by the B2P SUP at the corresponding approval offices at VF with Cubing report and Appearance Approval report (see VF Standard Color Matching / Appearance Approval VFDST00038400).  
Matching parts have to be present from B2P SUP. Timing will be provided by the matching department.
</page>

<page number="10">
Matching parts to be provided from B2P SUP free of charge, measured and marked according to VinFast Standards.

**Marking of Sample Parts:**
- Marking of sample parts must adhere to VF Standard VFDST00008700.  
- Preparation of measurement reports must follow VF Standard VFDST00008900.

**Evaluation System of Parts:**
- Parts evaluation complies with VF Standard VFDST00008300 (from sample parts).  
- Reference points systems must adhere to VF Standard VFDST00000011.

### 3.7.3.2 Release by Test Departments
The responsible VF test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the B2P SUP during complete vehicle integration tests.  
- B2P SUP must submit positive test reports for all required tests according to DVP&R.  
- In case of negative results, wrong parameters, or processes, B2P SUP must provide a test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions to ensure milestones and maintain targets.  
- Test reports must clearly state OK or NOK results on the first sheet.

### 3.7.3.3 Analyses and Test Reports
The B2P SUP is required to provide detailed measurement reports (VFDST00008900) in electronic format with aligned agreements and specified measurement concepts for all parts during prototype stages.  
- After individual tests, detailed analyses of test samples must follow.  
- Measurement and test results must be proven with individual values and documented in test reports, which are then handed over to the responsible VF department for release.

Upon request, results and documentation from tests (e.g., initial sample inspections, inspections conducted parallel to development) must be provided to the specialist department responsible for release.  
- Tests conducted parallel to series production are to be planned and documented as required.

### 3.7.4 Test Report Information
- Include a description or image of the part alongside relevant documentation (e.g., part number, change index, materials, production process, grease additives, deviations from serial processes).  
- All parts should be labeled with a description.  
- Include reasons for testing (e.g., negative test results), attaching earlier test reports.  
- Provide exact naming of testing standards, norms, legal requirements, or an exact description of the agreed testing procedure.

### 3.7.5 Documentation of Results
- Include a short description and detailed results in various formats (e.g., pictures, tables, photo documentation, comparisons with earlier test reports).  
- Evaluate results as OK/NOK, accompanied by images of testing procedures.  
- Compare test results with the specification book, testing specifications, and legal requirements.  
- Provide recommendations and describe corrective measures or further approaches in case of negative test outcomes.

These properties include rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety. FEM calculations will be applied to meet mechanical properties requirements. Tool-dimensioning for injection molding will be optimized via simulations.

Upon request, operative calculation models representing the development status must be made available to VinFast technical departments at no extra cost. Calculative documentation (e.g., FEM) must be produced before tool dimensioning.

**3.7.8 Component testing:** Detailed required testing is defined within the DVP, which must be agreed upon by VinFast and the B2P SUP. This agreement is binding.

**3.7.9 Mechanical integration tests:** The following tests are conducted as part of mechanical integration testing in a complete vehicle:
