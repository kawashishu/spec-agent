### 5. Description and Scope of Work  

#### 5.1 Technical Requirement  

##### 5.1.1 Project Requirements  

###### 5.1.1.1 Quality Requirements  
Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements.”  

The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.  

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.  

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistic specifications, etc.).  

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.  

Allowing for all of the tolerances which may occur in components and assemblies (BIW hood assembly, hinge assembly, FEM attachment), the latch must lock/secure the hood to the body at the defined closed position.  

The components are to be laid out such that the functions in connection with and to the adjacent systems are ensured.  

- The system/the component should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.  
- Should be designed for high-volume production.  
- Be maintenance free over the vehicle lifetime.  
- Emit no disturbing noises.  
- Be fully functional over 30,000 open-close cycles.  
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.  

##### Additional Requirements  
Refer to: General Engineering Requirements VinFast.  

##### 5.1.1.2 Certification  
The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST.  

The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.

Material data sheets have to be provided by supplier to VINFAST:  
**Project VINFAST IMDS-ID @ XXXX**.  

Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations which have been defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<).  

Material safety data sheets (SDS) according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (incl. national chemical inventory 2017) have to be provided for milestone concept confirmation.

- Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand (e.g., to support and reach vehicle data freeze milestones). These must be realized within LsDyna, as well as validated, numerical, and physically stable.  
- FE meshes must be homogeneous, according to part axles/geometry and with a density of 8-10mm. Non-compliance with meshing guidelines requires the FE meshes to be reworked.  
- For generating validated CAE material cards, activities must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier. This includes principal tests on systems as well as components.  
- The supplier's test matrix must be defined according to full vehicle timing demands. Before higher scaled tests are planned (e.g., sled or vehicle crash tests), supplier optimization test series must be completed.  
- Supplier-specific parts, required for testing activities at any project party, must be provided by the supplier free of charge to relevant testing facilities. Costs for physical parts and CAE models needed by suppliers must be taken into account by the supplier.

General Requirements:  
- For each single target value, a mandatory 20% safety margin has to be applied.  
- Occupant survival area integrity must be preserved versus part behavior and fluids. This includes parts directly and indirectly in contact with any passengers.  
- No edges below 3.2mm during and after impact.  
- Electrical system integrity must be maintained during impact and for post-crash functions.  
- All relevant tolerances must be considered.  
- Robust target achievement must be ensured.  
- Asymmetries must be investigated on each side until a reliable worst case is confirmed by VinFast.  
- No modifiers for any rating.  

Additional Requirements:  
The actuators are part of the APSS (active pedestrian safety system) ensuring that the hood is upright in time to protect pedestrians in case of impact. The key parameters for actuators are piston stroke, piston force, and retaining force.  
- All components must function within a temperature range between -30°C to +85°C and a relative humidity range of 10%-95%.  
- Hardware verification should ensure activation time and required forces at all conditions (lower boundary, room temperature, and upper boundary).  
- Tests (such as fall towers or high-speed video measurements) must utilize a state-of-the-art approach and verify both force vs. time and activation height vs. time.  
- The fixation brackets must sustain activation forces under all conditions without significant deformation, ensuring the hood-popping function remains operational.
</page>

<page number="19">
The supplier must ensure that the bracket deformation does not compromise the activation process. For example, the piston must remain securely engaged with the hinge counterpart throughout the activation and holding phases despite bracket deformation. 

The supplier must provide components for testing, partake in activator tuning, and ensure specialist involvement in local testing and troubleshooting processes.
