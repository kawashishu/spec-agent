</page>

<page number="11">
When selecting materials, attention should focus on reducing variety and ensuring compatibility with proven recycling technologies. 

Secondary raw materials, such as recycled polymeric PET fibers, recycled textiles, foams, and thermoplastics, must be prioritized for availability in the market. All recycled materials must comply with marking standards and be reported to VinFast's environmental compliance team.

### Recycling Scheme
Design for recycling is required to facilitate cost-effective recycling at the end of life. Suppliers are required to provide a simple recycling layout, including preferred recycling partners and cost estimates, to VinFast's environmental team before the PTO milestone.

### Evaporative Emissions
- Not applicable

### Drainage and Depollution
Complete fluid drainage is essential for safe end-of-life vehicle treatment. Drainage schemes, including tests for drained fluid types, mass (in kg), and percentages, must be presented to VinFast before the PTO milestone.

### Material Requirements & Corrosion
Refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and General Project Requirements for detailed specifications. Corrosion positions must be classified as follows:
1. **Corrosivity Low**: Used for positions resistant to macro wetness, mud, dirt, or salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium**: For positions moderately exposed to the above conditions.
3. **High Corrosivity**: Default for exterior positions exposed directly to road spray.
</page>

<page number="12">
4. Very high corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations must be chosen to prevent galvanic corrosion. This also applies to fasteners and attached brackets. If critical material combinations exist, proper coating such as paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers must be added. 

Drainage should always be provided at the lowest positions to avoid water and dirt accumulation. Dirt traps where sand acts as an abrasive and damages the painted body by micro movements must be avoided. Contact surfaces to the body should be dry, large enough for low pressure, and constructed from non-abrasive material. Micro-movement should be minimized. Furthermore, ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

Corrosion tests:
System/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests are mandatory for all parts.

Component test for metallic surfaces:
- Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria defined below.

For organic coatings:
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria defined below.

Alternative tests are allowed if proposed by the supplier and accepted by a corrosion engineer.

### Test criteria:
| Area                          | Corrosivity          | Metallic coatings               | Organic coatings               | Pass criteria                |

Acceptance criteria: No surface defects.  
Also: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.

---

**Electric parts:**  
(Details not provided in the current content.)
</page>

<page number="14">
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex), when in wet locations.

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion. Terminals and connectors should not be placed on the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness; electrical connections must be protected from humidity. Grounding connections must have water-tight connecting surfaces if placed in a corrosive environment.

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content greater than 1% are highly sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal quickly, allowing moisture to enter.

### Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts from stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable components.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help prevent severe issues.
- In high stone-hitting risk areas, choose part materials and paint matching the same color to avoid visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements in the vehicle’s lower areas, ensure they are recessed deeply to prevent damage from stones.

### Test Plan
The test plan regulates who will conduct the testing, when it will occur, and which testing devices are required. The plan also includes visual representation of the results and an overview of testing progress. Control of test results must be ensured at all times. If VinFast requires verification of test results independently, the supplier development system (SDS) must provide the necessary parts free of charge.

The test procedures and associated documentation must be approved by the validation engineer and component lead engineer at VinFast. The test plan should be supplemented and updated weekly or when new data/information arises due to development changes. Responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the component rests with the SDS. Testing must be planned to ensure approval or re-testing in case of negative results, adhering to the committed schedule.

The SDS must ensure VinFast receives all relevant test protocols and reports for verification.
