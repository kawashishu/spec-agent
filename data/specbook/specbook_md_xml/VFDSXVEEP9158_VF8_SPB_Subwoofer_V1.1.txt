Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g. recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance experts team at VinFast.  

5.16.2 End of Life Treatment.  

**Dismantling Scheme**  
The dismantling scheme describes the requirements to the contractor in terms of a simple, unmixed dismantling of the component as well as its accessibility when assembled.  
Dismantling scheme has to be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

**Recycling Scheme**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.
</page>

<page number="26">
5.16 Design for Recycling  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling scheme must be provided to environmental experts team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

5.16.2 Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization  
To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:  
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks/check of deployment per component).  
- After the deployment of pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that are classified, according to waste legislation, as toxic or hazardous substances. Otherwise, the components shall be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances.  
- Successful deployment must be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle/via feedback from the deployment tool).  
- Mark positions of pyrotechnical components (especially “hidden” components, e.g. battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest).  
- In cases of non-deployment, removal of pyrotechnical components is required. If technically possible, pre-dismantling shall be avoided to ensure accessibility of fasteners.

5.16.3 Eco-Design  
Parts Marking  
Parts marking should follow the rule "as few characters as possible but as many as necessary." Markings consist of brief type designations as defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). Codes are enclosed in arrowed brackets, represented by mathematical signs for "more than" (>) and "less than" (<).

5.16.4 Lifecycle Analysis  
N/A

5.16.5 Emissions & Toxicology  
Harmful Substances in Components and Materials  
The emission behavior of the E/E product that directly contacts the interior compartment must be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Volatile organic compound emissions in the passenger compartment must be minimized accordingly.  
Required testing must be arranged by the supplier in agreement with VinFast's specialist department to ensure confirmation of emission characteristics. Measurements must be conducted at VinFast-approved testing institutes. Suppliers are encouraged to obtain a list of approved institutes from VinFast. Additional requirements may be specified in project-specific documents (e.g., Emission Guideline).

5.17 Mechanical Requirements.

5.17.1 Load.

**Operating loads.**  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast.  
The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.

**Special events.**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. <100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.

**Misuse events.**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned so that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or neighboring components (principle “deformation before break”).

5.17.2 Vibration Behavior.

**NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior.**  
The maximum vibration level is to be defined by the supplier (brackets must be developed to avoid resonances below a certain frequency).  
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 35Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VF. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.

5.17.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics.

**No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.**

The component must be stable over time. No deformation or shrinkage over time, temperature, moisture, dirt, UV radiation allowed. Glues must keep the specified adhesion. This is especially valid for the membrane, suspension, voice coil-, dust cap- and membrane glue.

Req ID: 30560.  
Check-in date: 11.07.18.  
S&R, General.  
Noises which are perceived by the customers as disturbing have to be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps and forming.  
The supplier has to guarantee that their components are free of disturbing noise in their vehicle environment and their geometrical integration under all environmental conditions and over the fixed component service life. No squeak and rattle noises must occur under excitation of the body (wind load, torsional flexing, etc.) if real relative movements evolve on the surface. This must be guaranteed under all operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).  
To evidence the disturbing noise freedom, the requirements must be coordinated with the responsible testing team.  
The supplier is responsible for supporting the development of vibration and acoustic behavior of the subsystem within the complete vehicle environment and has to ensure constant acoustic quality of delivered parts. This includes active support to identify problems and propose solutions. Necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation must be delivered free of charge upon request.
