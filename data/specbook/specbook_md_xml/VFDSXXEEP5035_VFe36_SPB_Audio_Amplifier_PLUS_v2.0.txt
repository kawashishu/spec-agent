2 General Project Guidelines  

2.1 Development Scope Abstract  
This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the external amplifier.  
The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics.  
The contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements.  
Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details have to be reported immediately.  
The contractor is a "System Development Supplier," with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

2.2 Initial Situation and Objective  
The system is planned for use in various vehicle models, for various country-specific packages, and for various combinations of optional equipment. Adaptation of system functions to a given vehicle shall be accomplished by modular component population of the necessary modules and coding via the diagnostics interface.  
The design of the amplifier shall avoid noise generation like squeak and rattle as well as noise generation due to the moving parts. Furthermore, the electronics shall be designed to work without a fan or external cooling under the required temperature conditions.

2.3 Classification of the System / Component  
- Amplifier, electronic appliance.

2.4 Execution Regulations  
- International general electronic standard.

2.5 Development and Supply Scope  
The supplier status is "System Development Supplier," which means that the supplier has complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

<page number="9">
This responsibility includes the following: 
- Define, develop, 3D-design all parts within the system.  
- Create release drawings.  
- Ensure the function of the system.  
- Perform any required simulations or calculations on system level.  
- Validate the system according to the technical targets and tests stated in this specification.  
- System timing (in terms of project management, development, and industrialization).  

The agreed work-share is documented in the section “Work Interface Chart.”  

### 2.5.1 Work Interface Chart (RASI).
Work Interface Chart (RASI).  
The main supplier obligations are described in the work interface chart (RASI).  
The status of the supplier (“Built to Print” or “System Development Supplier”) is defined below System/Component Specification.  

RASI is defined as follows:  
**R: Responsible**  
Responsible for proper execution of the activities to fulfill the requirements. She/he is entitled to request the necessary support from other project team members.  

**A: Approval**  
Obligation to decide/responsible for release. If no decider is defined, the person who is responsible for execution R is the decider.  

**S: Support**  
Obligated to active support (even if this requires capacity, expenses, and/or transfer of know-how). This project team member must proactively assist the person responsible for execution R in achieving the targets.  

**I: Information**  
Right to information. This team member is entitled to demand information from R.

- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks/check of deployment per component).  
- After deployment of the pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that are classified according to the status of the respectively valid waste legislation as toxic waste or hazardous substances (otherwise the components shall be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances).  
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle or via the feedback at the deployment tool).  
- Marking positions of pyrotechnical components (especially “hidden” components, e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest).  
- In case of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is required. In this case, pre-dismantling, if technically possible, shall be avoided (accessibility of fasteners).

### Eco-Design  

**Parts Marking**  
Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for "more than" (>) and "less than" (<).

**Lifecycle Analysis**  
Not applicable.

**Emissions and Toxicology**  
**Harmful substances in components and materials**  
The emission behavior of the E/E product with direct contact to the interior compartment has to be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment have to be minimized accordingly. Required measurements for confirmation of the emission characteristics have to be done by the supplier in agreement with VinFast's specialist department. Testing institutes approved by VinFast are required, and the supplier must obtain an overview of all approved testing institutes. Additional requirements can be found in project-specific documents (e.g., Emission Guideline).  

**Volatile Organic Compounds**  
Components have to be checked according to ISO12219. The conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured through the complete product life cycle. The test result is evaluated by VinFast's specialist department. In any case, the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health has to be attested in written form on demand.  

The supplier must provide measurement results regarding VOC and Fogging for materials before the milestone purchase release.

### Mechanical Requirements

**Load**  

**Operating Loads:**  
Operating loads are the loads that occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived from measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast. Customer usage is based on VinFast's long-distance durability standards run for mileage targets specified in chapter 5.18.

**Special Events:**  
Special events are events of small frequency (approximately <100) that belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS braking. The vehicle must prevent these events from affecting functional integrity while ensuring no safety-relevant damages occur.

**Misuse Events:**  
Misuse events are occurrences outside the intended vehicle usage, e.g., curbstone impact. The vehicle must be dimensioned to ensure:
- Damages post-misuse are recognizable by the driver (e.g., tilt conditions in steering wheel or wheel).  
- A defined damage chain is upheld, favoring replaceable parts over crucial body structures.  
- Damages occur alongside recognizable plastic deformation within the same or neighboring components. ("Deformation before break.")

**Vibration Behavior**  

**NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior:**  
The maximum vibration level is to be determined by the supplier. Brackets must avoid resonance below defined frequencies. Components’ eigenfrequencies while mounted must exceed 35Hz, with proper alignment of fixation concepts with VinFast. Additional requirements may be defined in chapter 5.17.6.

### 5.17.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, or Fatigue.

### 5.17.4 Deformation
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, or Fatigue.

### 5.17.5 Pressure
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, or Fatigue.

### 5.17.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance

#### Fan
If the electrical control unit contains cooling fans, no tonal frequency bands are acceptable (adjacent bars must not exceed 3dB).

#### Audio Acoustics
Leakage and rattle-free mounting of the speakers must be possible. This is enabled by a wide basket mounting interface, a foam ring attached to the basket, and rigid basket material. The basket’s front side must allow sealed connection to the speaker grille (e.g., through a flat surface or a foam ring attached).

The component must remain stable over time. No deformation, shrinkage due to temperature, moisture, dirt, or UV radiation is allowed. Adhesives must retain the specified adhesion, particularly for the membrane, suspension, voice coil, dust cap, and membrane glue.

#### S&R General
Noises perceived by customers as disturbing must be eliminated through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier must guarantee that components are free from disturbing noises in their vehicle environment and geometrical integration. This includes excitation under all environmental conditions and during the component's service life.

Even during excitation of the body (wind load, torsional flexing, etc.), components must not exhibit squeak or rattle noises due to relative movements on the surface. This guarantee extends across operational and environmental conditions (temperature and humidity). The supplier must coordinate requirements with the responsible testing team to evidence noise freedom.

The supplier is responsible for supporting the development of vibration and acoustic behavior within the complete vehicle environment, ensuring consistent acoustic quality. Necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation must be actively provided free of charge.

### 5.18 Durability / Life Time
The specified durability is 10 years or 160,000 km (whichever comes first).
