5.17 Mechanical Requirements.

5.17.1 Load.
**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads refer to the loads occurring during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are determined by measurements conducted with selected benchmark vehicles on tracks specified by VinFast.  
The definition of customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target of the anticipated customer mileage of the car as defined in chapter 5.18.

**Special events:**  
Special events are rare occurrences with small frequency (approximately < 100) that fall under the intended use of the vehicle, such as ABS braking.  
The vehicle must be designed so that special events will not affect the system function, cause safety-related damages, or reduce the intended service life.

**Misuse events:**  
Misuse events refer to situations not included in the vehicle usage intention, such as curbstone impacts.  
The vehicle must be designed to ensure:  
- Damages resulting from misuse are easily recognizable by the driver (e.g., noticeable steering wheel inclination or wheel inclination conditions).
- A defined damage chain is maintained after a misuse event (e.g., replaceable parts are damaged before body structure components).  
Cracks or damages only occur along with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either on the same or neighboring components (following the principle of "deformation before break").
</page>

<page number="34">
5.17.2 Vibration Behavior.  
NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior.  
The maximum vibration level is to be defined by the supplier (brackets must be developed to avoid resonances below a certain frequency).  
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 35Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VF. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.  

5.17.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics.  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.  

5.17.4 Deformation.  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.  

5.17.5 Pressure.  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.  

5.17.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance.  

**Fan.**  
If the electrical control unit contains cooling fans, there are no tonal frequency bands acceptable (adjacent bars must not exceed by 3dB).  

**Audio Acoustics.**  
Leakage and rattle-free mounting of the speakers must be possible (wide basket mounting interface, foam ring attached to basket, rigid basket material). Basket front side must allow sealed connection to speaker grille (i.e., through flat surface or foam ring attached).  
The component must be stable over time. No deformation or shrinkage over time, temperature, moisture, dirt, UV radiation allowed. Glues must keep the specified adhesion. This is especially valid for the membrane, suspension, voice coil, dust cap, and membrane glue.  

Req ID: 30560.  
Check-in date: 11.07.18.  

**S&R, General.**  
Noises perceived by customers as disturbing must be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier must guarantee that their components are free of disturbing noise in their vehicle environment and their geometrical integration. Similarly, at vehicle- and audio system excitation under all environmental conditions and over the fixed component service life.  

There must not be squeak and rattle noise due to body excitation (wind load, torsional flexing, etc.) if relative movements evolve on the surface. This must be guaranteed under all operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity). To evidence the disturbing noise freedom, requirements must be coordinated with the responsible testing team.  

The supplier is responsible for supporting the development of vibration and acoustic behavior of the subsystem within the complete vehicle environment. The supplier must ensure constant acoustic quality of delivered parts, actively support problem identification, and propose solutions. Necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation must be delivered free of charge as requested.
