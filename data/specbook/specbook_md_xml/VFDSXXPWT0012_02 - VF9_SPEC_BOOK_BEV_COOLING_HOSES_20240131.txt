2 Specification summary.

Technical requirements summary:

- Refer to DVP for targets and acceptance criteria.

Material:
- EPDM
- PET
- PA66GF30%
- SS304
- 51CrV4

Functional / Performance:
Provide a flexible connection between moving components (engine and e-motor) and fixed connections in the car (radiator, expansion tank, pumps, etc). It must permit the flow of coolant at a high temperature / pressure and must be flexible to absorb movements of the engine and e-motor without ruptures, transmission of loads, and significant flow restrictions.

Part quality:
Sealing surface should be smooth and free from tool marks. No visual bubbles should be observed in the part when subjected to 2 bar air pressure during a water dip test.

Strength:
Details available in DVP report - VFTEXXPWT0122 / 02.

Durability / Fatigue:
Details available in DVP report - VFTEXXPWT0122 / 02.

Durability / Impact:
Details available in DVP report - VFTEXXPWT0122 / 02.
