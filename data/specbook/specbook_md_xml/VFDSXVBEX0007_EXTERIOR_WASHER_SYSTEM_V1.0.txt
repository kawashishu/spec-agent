Test Plan. The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results must be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.  

**Additional Guidelines for Test Procedures:**
- The documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.  
- The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or whenever new data/information due to development changes is needed.  
- The SDS bears full responsibility for safeguarding the component. Testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing for negative results.  
- SDS must ensure VinFast receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and can attend any testing at the SDS site or testing centers. Deviations from approved procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast and SDS.  
- If testing utilizes incorrect parts, missing parts, or inappropriate procedures, testing must be repeated at SDS's expense. Negative results require re-planning and retesting, also at SDS’s expense when responsible for the failure.  

**Required Data in DVP&R:**
1. Testing declaration specifying standard, norm, or legal requirement.  
2. Description of testing setup, including devices and accompanying pictures.

In case of any problems (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the SDS must submit a test report, must be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions to keep all milestones and observe all targets. OK or NOK result needs to be stated on the first sheet of the report.

Analyses and test-reports.
The SDS has to provide measurement reports (VFDST00008900) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during the prototype generations. After the individual tests, the test samples have to be analyzed in detail. The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report has to be handed over to the responsible VF department for release.

Upon request, the results together with the documentation of the tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development) are to be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests carried out parallel to series production are to be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.

Test-report and information:
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (part number, change index, materials, production process, additives like grease, and any deviation from approved serial process).
- All parts have to be labeled with a description.
- Eventually, the reason for testing (e.g., negative test results and attachment of earlier test reports).
- Testing with exact naming of testing standards, norms, legal requirements, or exact description of an agreed testing procedure.

Documentation of results:
- Short description of the result (pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of result OK/NOK, pictures of the parts in testing position, etc.).
- Comparison with results of the specification book, testing specifications, legal requirements, etc.
- Recommendation.
- Description of corrective measures or further approach in case of negative test results.
- Progressional testing status.
- Listing of all tests in a table with responsible person, part status, comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the SDS has to give a new date for re-test with countermeasures to VF for approval with the responsible person and company to do the test.

The VF test engineer has to be informed in periodic intervals with actual status and progress. If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.

- Uniform, proportionally accurate and material-compliant run-out of component edges, corners, and ribs.  
- Selection of concepts and production methods that facilitate homogeneous structures and grain structures.  
- Avoidance of visible screw points and screw point covers, as well as dummy covers.  
- Surfaces free of burrs in the visual and haptic zones.  
- Design ensuring no view of other parts (it should not be possible to recognize other components through grilles, trim covers, indentations, joints, and cavities; creating a neat and tidy overall impression).  
- Correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts must be ensured.  
- Surfaces must be free of disturbing noise in contact with the environment at all temperatures and driving conditions.

**Surface Standards:**  
- Surfaces have to be designed according to DIN EN ISO 1302.  
- Quality requirements at the supplier for production material adhere to "VFDST00055300."

Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

### Corrosion Requirements

**Corrosivity Classification**   
The determination of corrosion requirements involves classifying the corrosivity position for each component in the system based on the criteria below:  

1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default classification for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

**General Guidelines on Material Selection**  
- The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity.  
- Material combinations must prevent galvanic corrosion, ensuring proper coating or insulation if critical material combinations occur (e.g., using paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers).  
- Avoid water and dirt accumulation by providing drainage at the lowest positions and preventing dirt traps to reduce surface abrasion and damage.  
- Contact surfaces to the body must be dry, large enough to maintain low pressure, and made of non-abrasive materials. Minimize micro-movement.  
- Edge coverage must ensure burr-free edges and utilize a paint system with reliable edge coverage.  

**Corrosion Testing**  
The parts must pass both system/component-level tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests.  

**Component Testing for Metallic Surfaces:**  
The testing procedures and protocols must adhere to VinFast standards and ensure compliance with corresponding environmental requirements.
