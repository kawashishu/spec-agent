</page>

<page number="2">
1 Scope:
This document defines corrosion requirements to ensure an objective and reproducible test procedure for the referred tests through the complete project. It is required that the requirements for corrosion protection are harmonized and applied on subsystems, components, and material to ensure the vehicle's resistance to corrosion. If necessary, the corrosion requirement has to be discussed with the VinFast corrosion experts for confirmation.

3 Material Requirements & Corrosion.

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low.**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium.**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High Corrosivity.**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very High Corrosivity.**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

<page number="6">
The vehicle Exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes also fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (Paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).

Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in lowest positions. Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements. Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.

Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

### Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

#### NSS:
Neutral Salt Spray  

#### CCT:
Cyclic Corrosion Test  

#### CASS-Test:
Copper Accelerated Salt Spray Test  

#### Component test for Metallic surfaces:
- Salt spray test: ISO 9227, acceptance criteria see below.

#### For Organic coatings:
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO 11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.
- Alternative tests possible if proposed by supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

**Stainless steel:**
Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion), in most cases an insulating coating is needed.  
Test criteria for high visible parts: 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check especially areas with crevices.  
Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.  

**Aluminium parts:**
Aluminium parts in high visible areas have to be painted or anodized.  
Test criteria Painted Aluminium: see test criteria for organic coatings.  
Test criteria Anodized Aluminium: 480 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.  
Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.  

**Chromed metal parts:**
240h NSS ISO 9227 without base material corrosion.  

**Chromed plastic parts:**  
CASS-Test according to ISO 9227; duration:  
- 48h for Exterior  
- 24h for Interior  

Acceptance criteria: no surface defects.  
Also: 240h NSS ISO 9227 without surface defects.  

**Electric parts:**  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (type Gortex), when in wet locations.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes also fasteners and attached brackets.  
Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners, etc., that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible to other materials.  
The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  
Terminals, connectors: Don’t place Terminals on lowest points. Corrosion protection of Terminals is first of all a requirement for tightness: Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  
Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight, if placed in a corrosive environment.
