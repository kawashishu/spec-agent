Status  
Functional Responsibility  

**BEV Coolant Circuit:**  

The minimum coolant level in the Expansion tank must be located at the topmost point of the system for the circuit to function effectively. The Expansion tank must also provide adequate expansion volume to prevent coolant loss when the coolant expands due to temperature increases or vaporization after shutdown.  

Dimensions are defined based on ICE and BEV applications, focusing on providing a compact design. The supplier is responsible for ensuring cost-effective alternatives for each variant while maintaining acceptable quality.  

A single Expansion tank with different caps has been defined to support the vehicle programs:  

1. **ICE application:** The coolant temperature in the engine circuit may range from -30°C to 135°C, with ambient air temperatures between -30°C and 120°C. Normal working temperature for coolant is 110 ±10°C, and pressure varies between -10 kPa and 150 kPa overpressure.  
   
2. **BEV application:** The coolant temperature in the BEV E-drive and heating loops may range between -30°C and 95°C. Normal working temperature is below 90°C, and the pressure may vary from -10 kPa to 50 kPa overpressure.  

Cooling Expansion tank geometry shall fit within CAD model boundaries with small deviations accepted. It must be self-contained, with parts assembled within each other, and shall provide three mounting points. The exact location of these points must be confirmed. The supplier should propose the most cost-effective way to support both tank applications.  

Expansion tank geometry must accommodate filling gun compatibility and off-the-shelf caps.  

Expansion tank caps will differ for the two applications:  
- **Pressure release valve limit for ICE Expansion tank:** 1.5 bar.  
- **Pressure release valve limit for BEV Expansion tank:** 0.50 bar.  

Expansion tanks must include an integrated level sensor as part of their design.

BEV Expansion neck:
The BEV expansion neck has critical dimensional specifications, including an outer diameter of 52 mm and an inner diameter of 48 mm. The neck measures 36.9 mm in width at its intermediate section and has inner diameters progressively narrowing to 30 mm and 29 mm. The total depth of the neck reaches 37 mm, with specific features such as thread patterns and ridges designed for compatibility with BEV caps. 

ICE Expansion neck:
The ICE expansion neck features dimensions optimized for usage in internal combustion engine systems. Key measurements include an outer diameter of 51.6 mm and an intermediate width of 48.3 mm. The inner section narrows to measurements of 42 mm, 33 mm, and lastly 29 mm. The neck features a total depth of 37 mm, with additional threading and ridges designed for ICE caps and sealing purposes.

3 Requirements

3.2.2 Function

The expansion tank is part of a pressurized cooling system designed to push air bubbles up and move out of the system. The expansion system provides a volume for the expansion of the coolant as it is heated as well as a means of de-aerating the coolant within a pressurized closed circuit. The pressure cap is used to maintain pressure in the system. The expansion tank is a functional subsystem designed to meet thermal management requirements. Each component should be verified as follows:

- The minimum coolant level in the expansion tank must be located at the topmost part of the system for the circuit to work in the most effective manner.

- The expansion port should be located on the top side of the tank, and the output port should be positioned on the bottom side of the tank.

- The expansion tank must provide sufficient expansion volume to prevent the loss of coolant when the coolant expands. Expansion may occur due to increased temperature or vaporization after shutdown.

- To accommodate expansion due to coolant temperature increases, a minimum of 2.3 liters of total expansion tank volume can be assumed.

- The size and design of the reservoir must limit the flow rate and prevent aeration or air entering the system.
</page>

<page number="11">
- If required, baffles should be molded within the tank to minimize turbulence and ensure the coolant jet is directed along the tank at an optimal angle for dissipating kinetic energy effectively.

## 3.2.3 System requirements
General experience indicates that one Expansion tank is typically used in ICE applications, but multiple tanks may be implemented as per specific requirements. Cooling module suppliers must confirm system layouts.

The following requirements must be fulfilled:
- **Geometry**
- **Acoustics, vibrations, resonances**
- **Longevity under operational profile**
- **Ease of serviceability and repair**

The supplier is tasked with overseeing all development phases of the Expansion tank to ensure compliance with system performance criteria. The supplier-led activities include:
- Creation of the system concept
- Refinement of the packaging
- Proper sizing of the Expansion tank
- Evaluation of coolant flow distribution
- Identification of leakage pathways
- Assessment of cooling module pressure loss
- Analysis of uniformity in coolant flow

Providing flow rate data is crucial, as it serves as a boundary condition for cooling system simulation.

## 3.2.4 Interfaces
The components must be designed to guarantee functionality when integrated with adjoining systems and interfaces.

### Major interface points:
- **Coolant Lines and Pump**
- **Body-in-White (BIW)** – Clearances, packaging constraints, resonances, stiffness
- **Engine Assembly**
- **E-motor assembly and battery connections**
- **Chassis components** – Clearances to the fuel system, braking system, piping, etc.
- **Complete vehicle performance parameters**
- **Electrical connections**

The system is designed to endure ambient temperature fluctuations between -30°C to 100°C in corrosive environments. It is also expected to withstand various road load conditions, including challenging scenarios such as reckless driving on poor roads and off-road.

### Critical interfaces:
The tank fixation points are the most critical interfaces. A two-top and two-bottom-pin fixation strategy significantly influences the positioning of the cooling module and its clearance with surrounding systems. They also interact with the NVH insulation positioned between the FEM and the cooling module.

These interfaces should provide structural support and enhance durability, static performance, dynamic behavior, and tolerance alignment.
