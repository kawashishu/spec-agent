Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. 

The Supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

4.3.2 Europe.
a. Homologation and safety regulation activities:
The Supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.

6 Supplier responsibilities.
Suppliers are responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

### Customer service requirements.
**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need to ensure life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST end-of-production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).

7 Intellectual Property / Copyright.  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).

8 Insurance / Warranties.  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).
