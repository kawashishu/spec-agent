4 Definitions and applicable documents.

4.0 CAD Data/Transfer data-CAD Requirements.
All CAD data must be designed with CATIA V5 following the VF standard VFDST00000014. CAD data transfer from VinFast to the supplier will be completed through the Supplier collaborative module. For more details, refer to the Supplier collaborative module in the RFQ package.

4.1 Change Documentation and Part History Documentation.
During the development and production process, all changes within the contractor's framework must be documented and provided to VinFast and OEM/Supplier by the contractor (e.g., entries in a project manual). The data format may be defined by the contractor.

Vehicle Documentation Systems or components that must meet safety regulations or legal requirements must be indicated in the drawings. The reasons and characteristics that require documentation are listed by authorities. These demands will be requested during the development of the part and no later than the PTO phase.

5 Description and scope of work.

5.1 Technical requirement.
This specification establishes the technical cooling module requirements for the BEV electric pump. It must always be ensured that VinFast can audit the compliance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

The system developer commits to developing all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process to achieve the purpose of the project. 

The technical and commercial release will be carried out by the customer according to change management. For BEV vehicles, thermal management with an electric pump is a key component of the cooling system. The aim of the assignment is to have a validated electric pump for the BEV variants that support the cooling system requirements.

**5.2 System description**

Electric coolant circulation pumps are one of the main auxiliary devices used to cool power train components and other accessories such as cabin heating and electronic circuits cooling.  

The objective is to collect product portfolio information to make an informed selection of e-pump(s) necessary to support BEV applications.

<page number="8">
5.3 Package layout overview:

Complete vehicle is still under development. Use dimensions provided as reference to confirm technical feasibility and provide initial quotation. More accurate dimensions/envelops will be provided once they are available.

The system designer has to coordinate all components of the module in relation to: Packaging, Function, Fixing, and tolerances.

Dimensions shown are for reference, defined based on BEV layout but the objective is as compact as possible design, taking into account the overall low cost and acceptable quality. It is the responsibility of the supplier to confirm the most cost-effective alternative(s) for each variant.
