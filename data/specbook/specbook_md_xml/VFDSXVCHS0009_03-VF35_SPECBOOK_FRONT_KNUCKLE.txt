<page number="11">
Electric parts: Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex), when in wet locations.

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.

Terminals and connectors: Don’t place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily required for tightness, as electrical connections must be protected from humidity.

Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be watertight when placed in a corrosive environment.

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.

Joining Elements:

1. **Standard screws/Joining Elements**  
   - Coating: Galvanized Black passivation (trivalent chromium passivation) or Zinc-Aluminum Coating silver-gray  
   - Corrosion resistance target: min. 360h  

2. **SPR (Self Piercing Rivets)**  
   - Coating: Tin Zinc  
   - Corrosion resistance target: 96h  

3. **FDS (Flow Drill Screws)**  
   - Coating: Zinc Nickel  
   - Corrosion resistance target: 720h

<page number="12">
Prevention of stone chipping issues:
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone hitting risk, choose part materials and paints which have the same color, to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts which have edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.
For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.

**11 Production Quality**  

**11.1 In Process testing**  
In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuous improvement. Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan. When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked.  

The table that follows summarizes the various IP tests and the acceptance parameters for each. They form the basis on which to develop a complete Control Plan for these and their related significant process characteristics. The Control Plan will include frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.

11.2 Visual Inspection

All forgings will be 100% inspected in the as-forged condition, after heat treatment, and after machining at the time of packing. No surface defects (cracks, notches, malformed areas, etc.) in excess of this table are allowed. These allowable surface defect standards should be made available to the appropriate inspectors and operators at the various manufacturing facilities. The following applies to all surfaces, unless otherwise noted.

11.3 Dimensional Control  
The production supplier is responsible for writing the Control Plan and identifying significant characteristics (SC) in addition to significant and critical (SC, CC) features identified by VinFast. The supplier must establish initial process control and ongoing process capability reporting as per VinFast requirements. Characteristics requiring process capability are to be identified in the Control Plan, and capability must be established from 30 pieces randomly selected from a continuous production run of at least 300 pieces. Process capability must align with AIAG PPAP edition 4, and capability data must be included in the PPAP documentation.

When process capability has been demonstrated, X bar and R charts must be used unless specifically waived by VinFast ATI1. Acceptance by statistical process or sampling plans does not absolve the supplier of the responsibility to ensure that each part meets the purchase order requirements. If defects are identified in the sampling plan, the supplier must invoke the reaction plan specified in the Control Plan.

VinFast departmental requirements for acceptability of process capability numbers (Cp, Cpk, etc.) may supersede general guidelines. A documented fail-safe system, approved by VinFast, must be implemented to permanently remove non-compliant front knuckles at all forging, heat treating, machining, and assembly facilities.

11.4 X-RAY Inspection for Porosity, Voids, & Cracks (Applicable only for Casting)  
1. X-ray testing for internal discontinuities must follow the process control plan and be performed after casting during the PV and IP-I stages. This involves developing specific acceptance standards for critical areas prone to internal discontinuities (e.g., porosity, shrinkage). Standards must align with ASTM E155 and E505 references, approved by VinFast ATI1, and included in production control plans.

2. Operators must receive training in interpreting potential flaws with x-ray equipment following EN 473 or ISO 9712 standards for non-destructive testing personnel. Evidence of this training must be available for inspection by VinFast STA/ATI1.

3. Test equipment must detect discontinuities greater than or equal to ASTM E155 and E505 Plate 1 within defined critical areas. Film or real-time x-ray systems may be used if their defect detection capabilities meet these standards.

4. X-ray inspection equipment must allow inspectors to manually inspect any areas of the component as required. Automatic defect recognition systems may be used if their efficacy matches trained inspectors, proven during the 'run at rate trial' with the same component.

11.5 Fluorescent Dye Penetrant for Surface Defects (Casting/Forging) (crack check).

1. A fluorescent dye penetrant test for cracks and surface discontinuities will be performed on all exterior part surfaces, per ASTM E165 (method A) and ASTM E433.

2. Operators must receive appropriate training in interpreting potential flaws with the particular equipment chosen for the production dye penetrant inspection procedures in accordance with EN 473 (General principles for qualification and certification of NDT personnel) or ISO 9712 (Non-destructive testing - Qualification and certification of personnel). Evidence of this training shall be held on file for inspection by VinFast STA / ATI1.

3. Specified defects may be checked for severity by grinding removal if the following conditions are met:
   a) The removal method must be proven not to mask the defect to the fluorescent dye penetrant detection.
   b) The depth of removal must not create any stress raisers or thin out any wall thickness below the as-cast print specified minimum. The surface finishes after any material removal must be fine enough such that no notches are created which could initiate fatigue cracks (this is defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1mm and/or root radius less than or equal to 5mm).
   c) The depth of removal must not violate the part print tolerances.

4. If any defects in excess of the maximum allowable values and/or acceptance standards are found, refer to the reaction plan within the Process Control Plan.

5. All parts inspected during IP-II phase must be shown to be free from defects, for a period of 90 days in order that this requirement is revoked. Otherwise, dye penetrant inspection shall continue until ATI1 / STA is satisfied that this process is no longer necessary.

11.6 Feature Removal Standards & Surface Finish (Castings/Forging).

1. The maximum allowable flash will be no greater than 0.5 mm; a chamfer allowance of 2 mm (max) is acceptable to accommodate this requirement.

   - The use of controlled grinding operations on the part is approved for flash and sharp edge removal in order to ensure safe part handling.
   - In any areas where flash or other defects are removed, the minimum wall thickness detailed on the part model must be maintained.
   - In addition, the surface finish after any material removal must be fine enough so that no notches are present which could initiate fatigue cracks (this is defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1mm and/or a root radius less than or equal to 5mm).
   - In general, the removal of any material from a part must not compromise the part function.

As-cast surface roughness shall be less than or equal to cast surface Rz < 50, web & fettled areas Rz < 50. Equivalent specification to be followed for forged surfaces.
