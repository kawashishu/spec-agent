</page>

<page number="8">
3.3 Material requirement.

- Prohibited or Restricted Substances, Emissions & Toxicology:
  The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification have to be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier through the complete product life cycle according to VFDST00007601. IMDS material data sheets have to be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID according to the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and VFDST00007601. Specific targets on vehicle indoor air quality must conform to VFDSXVCVC3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline.

- For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
  1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
  2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
  3. **High corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
  4. **Very high corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

- Guidelines for materials and designs:
  - The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.
  - Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur—this includes fasteners and attached brackets.
  - In the case of critical material combinations, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers).
  - Avoid water and dirt accumulation; always provide drainage at the lowest positions.
  - Prevent dirt traps, where sand can act as an abrasive and damage the painted body through micro-movements.
  - Contact surfaces to the body should be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material.
  - Minimize micro-movements.
  - Ensure burr-free edges and provide a paint system with good edge coverage.

</page>

<page number="10">
### Stainless steel:
Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion), in most cases an insulating coating is needed. 

Test criteria for high visible parts: 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check especially areas with crevices.

Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

### Aluminum parts: [Not applicable for this Knuckle]
Aluminum parts in high visible areas have to be painted or anodized.

- **Test criteria Painted Aluminum:** Refer to test criteria for organic coatings.
- **Test criteria Anodized Aluminum:** 480h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.

Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

### Chromed metal parts:
240h NSS ISO 9227 without base material corrosion.

### Chromed plastic parts:
CASS-Test According ISO 9227; duration:
- **48h for Exterior**
- **24h for Interior**

Acceptance criteria: No surface defects.  
Also: 240h NSS ISO 9227 without surface defects.

### Electric parts:
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex), when in wet locations.

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur, including fasteners and attached brackets. 

Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners, etc., that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.

### Terminals, connectors:
Do not place terminals on lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is first of all a requirement for tightness: Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.
</page>

<page number="11">
Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.

Aluminum/sealing surfaces: Aluminum alloys with copper and iron content of >1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.

### Joining Elements:
- **Standard screws / Joining Elements:**
  - Coating: Galvanized Black passivation (trivalent chromium passivation) or Zinc-Aluminum Coating silver-gray.
  - Corrosion resistance target: min. 360h.

- **SPR (Self Piercing Rivets):**
  - Coating: Tin Zinc.
  - Corrosion resistance target: 96 h.

- **FDS (Flow Drill Screws):**
  - Coating: Zinc Nickel.
  - Corrosion resistance target: 720 h.

### Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues:
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts caused by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone hitting risk, choose part materials and paint with the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.

For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.

### Rear Knuckle Specific Material Requirements:
- **Process:** Tilt Gravity Die Casting process acceptable for knuckle.
- **Material Specification and Properties:** Refer to drawing.

Steel metal inserts: Refer to drawings.

<page number="21">
11.3 Dimensional Control. 
The production supplier is responsible for writing the Control Plan, identifying Significant Characteristics (SC) above the critical features (SC, CC) specified by VinFast, and establishing initial Process Control along with ongoing process capability reporting. The Control Plan must include features requiring process capability and must comply with AIAG PPAP edition 4. Capability data derived from 30 pieces randomly selected from a continuous production run of at least 300 pieces is required in the PPAP documentation. 

X-bar and R charts must be used to monitor the characteristics flagged in the Control Plan. Any defects found during implementation of the sampling plan necessitate invoking the reaction plan specified in the Control Plan. Acceptance criteria may be superseded by departmental requirements for process capability numbers (e.g., Cp, Cpk). Suppliers must implement fail-safe systems at all forging, heat treating, machining, and assembly operation stages to permanently remove non-compliant front knuckles. 

11.4 X-Ray Inspection for Porosity, Voids, and Cracks (Applicable only for Casting). 
1. X-ray testing for internal discontinuities must occur post-casting, as defined in the process control plan. Acceptance standards for critical areas prone to discontinuities must be approved by VinFast ATI1 and consistent with ASTM E155 & E505 standards. These standards are referenced in the production control plans.  
2. Operators must be trained per EN 473 or ISO 9712 standards to interpret flaws using chosen inspection equipment. Training records must be available for inspection by VinFast STA/ATI1.  
3. Test systems must detect discontinuities equal to or greater than ASTM E155 & E505 Plate 1 specifications in critical areas. Both film and real-time x-ray systems are acceptable.  
4. X-ray inspection equipment must provide manual inspection capabilities, and automated defect recognition systems are permissible following validated trial runs demonstrating the same reliability as trained inspectors.

11.5 Fluorescent Dye Penetrant for Surface Defects (Casting/Forging). 
1. Fluorescent dye penetrant tests for surface cracks and discontinuities must align with ASTM E165 (Method A) and ASTM E433 standards.  
2. Operators must undergo proper training for the dye penetrant inspection processes, adhering to EN 473 or ISO 9712 standards. Evidence of training must be retained for VinFast STA or ATI1 review.
</page>

<page number="22">
11.5 Fluorescent Dye Penetrant for Surface Defects (Casting/Forging) (crack check).

1. A fluorescent dye penetrant test for cracks and surface discontinuities will be performed on all exterior part surfaces, per ASTM E165 (method A) and ASTM E433.

2. Operators must receive appropriate training in interpreting potential flaws with the equipment chosen for the production dye penetrant inspection procedures in accordance with EN 473 (General principles for qualification and certification of NDT personnel) or ISO 9712 (Non-destructive testing - Qualification and certification of personnel). Evidence of this training shall be held on file for inspection by VinFast STA / ATI1.

3. Specified defects may be checked for severity by grinding removal if the following conditions are met:
   a. The removal method must be proven not to mask the defect to the fluorescent dye penetrant detection.
   b. The depth of removal must not create any stress raisers or thin out any wall thickness below the as-cast print specified minimum. The surface finishes after any material removal must be fine enough such that no notches are created which could initiate fatigue cracks (defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1 mm and/or root radius less than or equal to 5 mm).
   c. The depth of removal must not violate the part print tolerances.

4. If any defects in excess of the maximum allowable values and/or acceptance standards are found, refer to the reaction plan within the Process Control Plan.

5. All parts inspected during IP-II phase must be shown to be free from defects, for a period of 90 days in order that this requirement is revoked. Otherwise, dye penetrant inspection shall continue until ATI1 / STA is satisfied that this process is no longer necessary.

11.6 Feature Removal Standards & Surface Finish (Castings/Forging).

1. The maximum allowable flash will be no greater than 0.5 mm; a chamfer allowance of 2 mm (max) is acceptable to accommodate this requirement. The use of controlled grinding operations on the part is approved for flash and sharp edge removal to ensure safe part handling. In any areas where flash or other defects are removed, the minimum wall thickness detailed on the part model must be maintained. In addition, the surface finish after any material removal must be fine enough so that no notches are present which could initiate fatigue cracks (defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1 mm and/or a root radius less than or equal to 5 mm). In general, the removal of any material from a part must not compromise the part function.

As-cast surface roughness shall be less than or equal to cast surface Rz < 50, web & fettled areas Rz < 50. Equivalent specification to be followed for forged surfaces.

11.7 Microstructure (Casting) Casting [Aluminum]:

1. The microstructure appearance of the casting shall be performed to understand the silicon eutectic modification, grain size and secondary dendrite arm spacing to meet minimum mechanical requirements.

2. Microstructure shall consist of eutectic silicon particles and other complex constituents in the aluminum alloy matrix. Silicon particles shall be rounded.

3. The Aluminum-Silicon eutectic modification shall be at least class 4 in all areas according to Microstructure Control in Hypoeutectic Aluminum-Silicon alloys chart by American Foundry Society.

4. Secondary Dendritic Arm Spacing (SDAS) shall be less than 30 micrometers. Sections from the used tensile samples may be used. Frequency of check shall be once per heat treat batch.

Forging [Aluminum]:

1. The microstructure appearance of the forging shall be performed to understand the grain size, grain orientation, grain extension ratio, and end of flow lines to meet minimum mechanical requirements.

2. For the validation of the furnace heat treatment process per batch, test bars are to be taken from LH Knuckle and RH Knuckle. Specified areas from the component (FIGURE 11.4) are to be checked. It is intended that once sufficient data has been collected to show adequately reproducible mechanical properties throughout the heat treat lot, and with agreement of VinFast ATI1/STA, the sample size will be reduced to two (2) test bars from one (1) pair (4 in total) per heat treat lot.  
3. All tensile bar sizes and types should conform to BS-EN 10002-1. To ensure consistent testing, it is required that the testing be performed with 6mm gauge diameter test specimens. All other sample dimensions are to be derived from the BS-EN standard.  
4. In addition to meeting all ASTM B108 requirements, the individual strength criteria must be met in the tensile specimens designated in Sections M.2. The minimum mechanical properties are to be taken from the drawing.  
5. If minimum requirements are not met, refer to the reaction plan contained within the VinFast Product Development-approved Control Plan.  

**11.9 Casting and Forging Simulations**  
**Forging Simulation:**  
A proper forging simulation is required to prove that the forging is sound, free of imperfections in areas critical to quality, and meets all engineering requirements including fit and function.  
Forging simulation should report the following:  
- Tool filling velocity plots and simulation  
- Tool filling temperature plots and simulation  

**Casting Simulation:**  
A proper casting simulation is required to prove that the casting is sound, free of imperfections in areas critical to quality, and meets all engineering requirements including fit and function.  
Casting simulation should report the following:  
- Mold filling velocity and temperature plots and simulation  
- Air pressure/air entrapment plots  
- Fraction solid plots  
- Porosity plots  
- Solidification time plots  

**11.10 Impact Energy [Casting & Forging] [Steel/ Aluminum]:**  
An impact test should be carried out using the Charpy method to determine the impact energy of the part [J] at a temperature [X °C] and notch type [U or V] to be defined.

#### Figure 11-2 – Porosity Standards:
A detailed diagram specifies pore size and distribution allowances across different areas of the part.

#### Summary Table of Porosity Standards:
| **Area in Question** | **Pore Class Allowed** | **Quantity of Pores Allowed** |
|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Milled Surfaces       | 2.0 / 10              | 3                              |
| Through Holes         | 2.0 / 10              | 3                              |
| Threaded Holes        | 2.0 / 5               | None in 1st 5 threads; 2 in all other areas |
| Bushing Holes         | 2.0 / 10              | 3                              |

#### Example Interpretation:
For milled surfaces, up to 3 pores are allowed with a maximum diameter of 2mm, provided that they are not closer to each other than 10mm.
