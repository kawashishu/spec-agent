3.2.1 Appendix: RADAR COVER (MMR – SRR)

**Material Properties**  
Material properties provided by the manufacturer typically apply to frequencies in the MHz range and below. At higher frequencies, material properties can vary significantly from data sheet values.  

The roughness of the material should not exceed lambda/10 (≤ ~400 µm).  

Materials used for the bumper’s structure or secondary surface must meet the following criteria:  
- Synthetic materials with low dielectric loss factors at the specific radar frequency must be utilized to achieve low transition damping.  
- Synthetic materials with low dielectric constants (εr) must be used to minimize surface reflection.  

**Painting**  
The secondary surface can generally be painted, but it requires detailed analysis and control of possible painting categories to avoid significant performance degradation.  

Typically, the secondary surface will consist of several layers such as primer, paint, and varnishes. These layers, combined with the structural material, impact both surface reflection properties and transmission damping.  

Metallic materials degrade sensor radiation and must not be utilized as the secondary surface. Any elements containing metallic particles must be validated. The applicability of metallic paintings depends on the following:  
- The percentage of metal content in the paint  
- The size and shape of metal particles within the paint  
- The number and thickness of paint layers and primers  

The number of painting layers should be capped at four to meet maximum one-way attenuation standards.  

3.2.2 Parting Lines on Radius  
All parts with visible parting lines on the A-Face must be reworked before painting to achieve a high-quality finish.

3.3 General CAE Requirements.

Refer to SOR: VFSRXXCVC0201 DSUV_Appendix_2_CAE_FEM_General requirements.

3.4 Material Requirement.

- **Prohibited or Restricted Substances, Emissions & Toxicology:**
  The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification must be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier through the complete product lifecycle according to VFDST00007601. IMDS material data sheets must be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID, adhering to the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and VFDST00007601. Specific targets on vehicle indoor air quality must comply with VFDSXVCVC3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline.

3.4.1 Corrosion.

Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC ("VinFast").

- **Determination of Corrosion Requirements:**
  The corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
  - *Corrosivity Low:* Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
  - *Corrosivity Medium:* Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
  - *High Corrosivity:* Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
  - *Very High Corrosivity:* Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

- **General Considerations:**
  - The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity.
  - Material combinations must prevent galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and brackets. In cases of critical combinations, proper coatings such as paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers must be applied.
  - Drainage must be provided in lowest positions to avoid water and dirt accumulation.

Also: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.  

**Electric parts:**  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units shall be ventilated via a moisture/ wetness resistant membrane (type Gortex), when in wet locations.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes also fasteners and attached brackets.
</page>

<page number="14">
Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials. 

Electrical components must be installed to prevent vibrations causing fretting corrosion. Terminals and connectors should not be placed at the lowest points. Tightness is crucial for corrosion protection of terminals—electrical connections must be protected from humidity. Connecting surfaces of groundings must be water-tight if placed in corrosive environments. 

Aluminium sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content greater than 1% are highly sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal quickly, allowing moisture to enter.

### Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts due to stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:
- Provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts wherever possible.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas reduces the likelihood of severe issues.
- In areas of high stone impact, use materials and paints with the same color to avoid visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements in the lower areas of the vehicle, ensure they are recessed to reduce exposure to stone impacts.

### 3.4.2 Environmental Compatibility
Minimization of environmental impacts across a product's life cycle is critical for innovative product development. This requires:
- Use of recyclable materials.
- Use of recycled materials and renewable resources.
- Prevention of hazardous substances.
- Minimization of compartment emissions, including odor.
- Efficient use of resources.
- Waste prevention strategies.
- Identification marking of parts for end-of-life processing.
