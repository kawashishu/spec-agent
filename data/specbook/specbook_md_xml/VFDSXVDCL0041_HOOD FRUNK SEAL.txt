5. Description and scope of work

5.1. Technical requirement

5.1.1. Project Requirements

5.1.1.1. Quality Requirements  
Please refer to VINFAST “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements”.

5.1.1.2. Certification  
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product, and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle level system integration and certification. Vehicle level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing, and component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.  
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. Supplier must complete all component/subsystem tests.  
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.  
- In any event, the supplier is obligated to complete all specified test requirements.  
- The component/subsystem supplier must provide VINFAST's product release engineer with a complete component/subsystem test certification plan approved by the engineer. The plan shall include at least: number of samples, test sequence, place and time of each test.

5.1.2. General Description of the System / Component  
It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.  
Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification have to be agreed between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.  
The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design-process in order to achieve:  
- System-specific requirements  
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of system markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.  
For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of development the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality and time-schedule.  
The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.
</page>

<page number="9">
Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of system markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class B and C common platform. VINFAST shall also monitor ongoing changes in rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.

The supplier delivers the system as a module (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated).

### Add-on parts are:
- Drawings  
- Simulations  
- Quality regulations  
- Results/documentation of test validation  
- Documentation of the FMEA.  

All parts of the assembly must be matched to each other. Functional dimensions must be fulfilled according to the prescription.

#### Notes:
1. Serious (`a`) indicates significant defects; mild (`b`) represents tolerable minor defects.
2. The absence of A/B classification means defects are considered regardless of their appearance location.
3. Surface defects at part A are noted for the current rubber product belt surface.
4. For pressed rubber surfaces, details fall under part B defects.
5. Interior decorations requiring specific texture or color should follow relevant color plate references.
6. Products with bright stripes require protective film application; residual glue should not affect aesthetics after removal.
7. Injection head products must follow surface-specific requirements outlined in the drawing.

The supplier shall cooperate with the national authorities and VINFAST Company in the sampling inspection of the parts or materials provided by the supplier. The sampling inspection may be conducted by a technical service agency entrusted by the national authorities or by an independent and professionally qualified third-party certification agency jointly recognized by both parties. If the parts or materials provided by the supplier are found not meeting the requirements in the sampling inspection, VINFAST will punish the supplier according to the relevant regulations of the company, and the supplier will bear all the expenses of sampling inspection. If VINFAST products fail to meet the limits and measurement requirements of prohibited substances in automobiles, the supplier shall bear all losses caused thereby.

Concerning the compliance to legal requirements regarding prohibited substance IMDS-Material Data Sheets (MDS) have to be sent to VinFast via IMDS-System.

### Corrosion, surface:
- For the series, the support tube is unpainted. The surface is slightly oiled but free of oil accumulations.
- The oil used must not cause any odor nuisance in the passenger compartment or endanger the health of the driver and front passenger. For this reason, the lubricants required for production, which may adhere to the support tube, must be agreed upon with VINFAST.
- Suitable measures must be provided for material combinations on the support structure, e.g., steel/AL/Mg.
- For corrosion reasons, the parts must be loaded in covered areas protected from the weather (rain, snow). Parts must be transported in closed transport vehicles (e.g., trucks with tarpaulin).

### Generally:
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosively position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosively Low**: 
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosively Medium**: 
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. **High Corrosively**: 
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very High Corrosively**: 
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

### Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

#### Component test for metallic surfaces:
- **Fog test**: ISO6270 CH  
  Acceptance criteria: see below.
</page>

<page number="21">
Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.

For Organic coatings: Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.

Alternative tests are possible, if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

**Test criteria:**
- **Area:** Interior, mounted parts, dry area.  
  - **Corrosivity:** Low.  
  - **Metallic coatings:** 240 h NSS → ISO 9227.  
  - **Organic coatings:** 96 h → ISO6270 CH.  
  - **Pass criteria:** No red rust.

- **Area:** Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, wet area.  
  - **Corrosivity:** Medium.  
  - **Metallic coatings:** 480 h NSS → ISO 9227.  
  - **Organic coatings:** 5 cycle CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B.  
  - **Pass criteria:** NSS: No red rust. CCT: See below.

- **Area:** High/not visible for customer.  
  - **Corrosivity:** High.  
  - **Metallic coatings:** 480 h NSS → ISO 9227.  
  - **Organic coatings:** 10 cycle CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B.  
  - **Pass criteria:** NSS: No red rust. CCT: See below.

- **Area:** High/visible, very high.  
  - **Corrosivity:** High.  
  - **Metallic coatings:** 720 h NSS → ISO 9227.  
  - **Organic coatings:** 10 cycle CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B + stone chipping protection where needed.  
  - **Pass criteria:** NSS: No red rust. CCT: See below.

**Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:**
- **Rust creep:** According to ISO4628-8.  
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.
- **Blistering:** Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).
- **Edge corrosion:** ≤ 10%.
- **Weld seam corrosion:** ≤ 5%.
- **Degree of rusting:** ≤ Ri 1 (according ISO4628-3).

**General guidelines:**
- The interior is basically considered a dry area, meaning areas with low corrosivity. Exceptions might include the floor area or areas where wetness or abrasion (e.g., shoes or spilled liquids) could produce corrosion.
- Avoid galvanic corrosion when combining different metals by coating such parts.
- Edges, especially painted edges, should be burr-free to ensure good edge coverage and avoid wear.
- For seat structures with uncoated (blank steel): New parts must be corrosion-free, and any areas with corrosion risk must not be visible to the customer. Extreme positions of the seat-rests should be considered.
</page>

<page number="22">
On other invisible areas the test criteria may also be lower than above mentioned, but it must be ensured that no corrosive products appear in visible areas, and further the full function over lifetime must be assured.

Vehicle tooling: Usually stored in the trunk, considered to have low corrosively exposure. For tool surfaces with wear, the corrosivity might be medium.

### 5.4. Traceability
For part requirements, follow specifications as per VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

#### Labeling of Parts
Suppliers must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010.

### 6. Testing and Validation
DVP and PC test responsibilities must follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for system, sub-system & component level must align with the Complete Vehicle Specification Book in the concept phase. A detailed test plan for hardware tests in the file DVP&R must be prepared in collaboration with the Testing & Validation department:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirements.
- Description of how and with which devices the testing was performed (including testing setup pictures).
- Identification of where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Documentation of duration and the timeline of testing (presented in project plan form).
- Part variant description.
- Number of tested components/parts.

#### Ensure Mileage Target Life
160,000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first). Refer to DVP component **VFDSXVDCL0141**: **DVP_COMPONENT_HOOD FRUNK SEAL.**
