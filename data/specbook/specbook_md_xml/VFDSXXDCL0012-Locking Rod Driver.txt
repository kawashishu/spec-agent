**3.2 Technical requirement.**

3.2.1 Project Requirements.

3.2.1.1 Quality Requirements.

Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements.”

The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.  

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.  

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistic specifications, etc.).  

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.  

The finished assembly should meet all dimensional and form tolerance according to VFDST00018200:  
- The assembly structure should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.  
- Should be designed for high-volume production.  
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime.  
- Emit no disturbing noises.  
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.
</page>

<page number="7">
Additional Requirements.

Refer to Part 1: General Engineering Requirements VinFast.

Reset after actuation.
Hood must stay in open activating position minimum 350ms after ignition. After this time, no special requirement is given.

3.2.1.2 Certification.
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing. Component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. Suppliers must complete all component/subsystem tests.
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.
- In any event, the supplier is obligated to complete all specified test requirements.
- The component/subsystem supplier must provide VINFAST's product release engineer with a complete component/subsystem test certification plan approved by the engineer. The plan shall include at least: the number of samples, test sequence, place, and time of each test.

3.2.2 General Description of the System/Component.
It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification have to be agreed upon by the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:
- System-specific requirements.
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of system markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.

For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time schedule.

The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.
</page>

<page number="8">
**Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all legal requirements of system markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class B and C common platform. VINFAST shall also monitor ongoing changes of rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.**

**The supplier delivers the system as a module, with all relevant add-on parts already integrated. Add-on parts are:**
- Drawings
- Simulations
- Quality regulations
- Results / documentation of test validation
- Documentation of the FMEA

**All parts of the assembly must be matched to each other. Functional dimensions must be fulfilled according to the prescription.**
