Requirements:  
During the stiffness and rigidity testing, there must not be any permanent deformations, no breakage, and no customer-relevant modifications.  

Most important functions of the cockpit:  
- Optical trim.  
- Absorption of noises.  
- Absorbing properties in case of head-impact.  
- Integration of add-on parts.  
- Fulfillment of all functions over the lifetime.  

**Crosscarbeam IP:**  
- The cross car beam (CCB) should be used as the main fixation of the IP.  
- Master Reference Point between IP main carrier and CCB in Y=0.  
- Input about the kind of fixation and stiffness defined from SDS IP.  
- Technical CCB specifications are defined in the spec book CCB.  

**Airbag door:**  
- The airbag door contains an invisible breakup solution. The lid-carrier is horizontally divided, if possible symmetrical.  
- If the supplier believes another airbag door solution fulfills the requirements better, they have the responsibility to inform, present, and discuss the concept with VinFast.  
- The split line must be invisible on the dashboard skin (A-surface).  
- Hinge lines must not leave marks on the skin.  
- All break lines of the airbag door must be invisible and may be created by cutting with a cold knife or by laser.  
- The airbag door must be tested at all temperatures:  
  -- Room temperature (+20°C), low temperature (-30°C), and high temperature (+85°C).  
  -- All generator loads (Minimum/Nominal/Maximum load).  
  -- Testing temperature tolerance: ±2.5°C.  
- VinFast proposes incorporating an airbag shooting channel on the IP's backside using vibration welding, ultrasonic welding, or infrared welding.  
- Injection molded dashboards with integrated shooting channels are also acceptable if no split lines are visible on the A-surface of the dashboard, and all other requirements are met.  
- The target design eliminates the need for a separate door for the passenger airbag.  
- Integrated airbag doors must firmly attach to the dashboard to avoid risks of detachment.  
- No injury risks to occupants caused by the dashboard or airbag door during or after deployment (collision, secondary collision) must be ensured.  

**Opening Force of the Airbag Door:**  
- The airbag door's opening force must be agreed upon with the airbag supplier and specified in the production drawing.  
- Maximum opening force: Less than 2.3 kN.  
- For the airbag door's testing program, refer to the safety and restraint system specification. The appendix of the subsystem technical specification for safety and restraint systems contains validation programs for all development phases.

**Generally:**  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very high corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

---

**Corrosion Tests:**  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

**Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:**  
- **Fog test:** ISO6270 CH, acceptance criteria see below.  
- **Salt spray test:** ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.  

**For Organic Coatings:**  
- **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.  

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by a corrosion engineer.  

---

**Test Criteria:**  

| **Area**                     | **Corrosivity**      | **Metallic coatings**                | **Organic coatings**          | **Pass criteria** |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                  | 240 h NSS → ISO9227                 | 96 h → ISO6270 CH             | No red rust       |
| Exterior                      | Medium               | 480 h NSS → ISO9227                 | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust  |
| High & not visible for customer | Medium/High          | 480/720 h NSS → ISO9227             | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust, CCT: See below |
</page>

<page number="40">
**VinFast Management System**

**Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT:**
- Rust creep according to ISO4628-8:
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1-2 mm.
- Blistering:
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).
- Edge corrosion:
  - ≤ 10%.
- Weld seam corrosion:
  - ≤ 5%.
- Degree of rusting:
  - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

**Interior Classification:**
The interior is basically considered to be a dry area, meaning areas with low corrosivity. Exceptions may include the floor area or regions where wetness/abrasion by shoes or spilled drinks could produce corrosion.

**Best Practices for Preventing Corrosion:**
- Avoid combining different metals to prevent galvanic corrosion, or coat such parts appropriately.
- Ensure edges, especially painted edges, are burr-free to maintain proper edge coverage and prevent wear.
- Seat structures using uncoated (blank steel): New parts must be corrosion-free, and corrosion risk areas must not be visible to the customer. Consider extreme positions of seat supports.

**Invisible Area Testing:**
Test criteria may be reduced for invisible areas. However, it must still be guaranteed that corrosive products do not manifest in visible locations, ensuring full functionality over the component's lifetime.

**Vehicle Tooling:**
Typically stored in the trunk and exposed to low corrosivity conditions. However, tool surfaces subject to wear may experience medium corrosivity exposure.

**See Also:**
Corrosion requirements on electric components.

**Test Plan**
The test plan governs:
- Responsibility: Specifies by whom and when the testing will be carried out.
- Testing Devices: Details necessary equipment for testing.
- Results Monitoring: Ensures that visual results and progress tracking are managed consistently.

**VinFast's Role in Test Verification:**
If VinFast chooses to verify test results independently:
- The SDS must provide the required parts free of charge.
- Test documentation needs approval from VinFast’s test engineer.

**Test Plan Updates:**
- The plan must be supplemented and updated weekly or in alignment with new information arising due to developmental changes.
- The SDS is accountable for the overall safeguarding of their component testing and must plan testing timelines for approvals and re-tests in case of negative results.

**SDS Documentation Responsibilities:**
The SDS must:
- Ensure VinFast receives all relevant test protocols or reports for verification purposes.
- Provide access for VinFast to attend testing at SDS sites or affiliated testing centers.
- Obtain mutual agreement from VinFast for deviations from standard testing procedures.
</page>

<page number="41">
If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing must be redone at the expense of the SDS. In cases of negative test results, the tests must be re-planned, and the retesting costs assumed by the SDS if they are determined to be responsible for the failure.

### Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
