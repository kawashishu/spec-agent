The supplier must prove fulfillment of a target value <3 for odor according to this specification book via measurements. Measurement results regarding odor for components must be provided by the supplier before the milestone purchase release. An optional test procedure to measure odor behavior of components can be defined in alignment with VINFAST experts according to ISO 12219, part 7.

**Interior parts emissions (bag method):**  
The emissions of interior components, semi-finished products/auxiliary means, and surface materials (foils, artificial leather, films) must be checked according to standard ISO 12219, part 2 ('bag method'). Fulfillment of target values for interior part emissions must be proven by suppliers via measurements defined by VINFAST.  

**Harmful substances in components and materials:**  
The emission behavior of the product must be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment must be minimized. Required measurements for emission confirmation must be conducted by suppliers in agreement with VINFAST's specialist department and completed at VINFAST-approved testing institutes. Suppliers are recommended to obtain an overview of all testing institutes approved by VINFAST. Additional project-specific requirements can be found in documents (e.g., Emission Guidelines).  

Volatile organic compounds of components must be checked according to ISO 12219. Compliance with prohibited substances must be ensured throughout the product life cycle. The test results are evaluated by VINFAST's specialist department, and suppliers must provide written certification of the harmlessness of volatile compounds to human health upon demand.

**Pyrotechnic initiator neutralization:**  
To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) must be provided via the diagnostic interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components by adhering to the following requirements:  
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoiding noise and pressure peaks/check of deployment per component).  
- After deployment, solid combustion residues from pyrotechnical components must not remain. Residues classified as hazardous substances under waste legislation must be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances unless they are fully neutralized.
</page>

<page number="22">
Functional Responsibility.

Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle/via the feedback at the deployment tool).
- Marking of positions of pyrotechnical components (especially “hidden” components, e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest).
- In case of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is required. In this case, pre-dismantling, if technically possible, shall be avoided (accessibility of fasteners).

Recycling:
Recycled Materials:
- When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’).
- Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclers and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred in respect to their availability in the market.
- Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert’s team at VINFAST.

Recycling Scheme:
- This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.
- Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.
- The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.
- Recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental experts team at VINFAST before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

Material Requirements & Corrosion:
Please refer to the VINFAST Request for Quotation.

Additional Requirements:

Corrosion Requirements Interior:
- Screws, bolts on handles, mirror.
- Key.
- Seat belts.
- Trunk area.

</page>

<page number="23">
Generally:  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. Corrosively Low:  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. Corrosively Medium:  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. High corrosively:  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. Very high corrosively:  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

### Corrosion Tests:  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

#### Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:  
- **Fog Test:** ISO6270 CH, acceptance criteria see below.  
- **Salt Spray Test:** ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.  

#### For Organic Coatings:  
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.  
- Alternative tests possible if proposed by supplier and accepted by corrosion engineer.  

#### Test Criteria:  
| Area                       | Corrosivity                 | Metallic Coatings                        | Organic Coatings                      | Pass Criteria                      |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                         | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227                    | 96 h → ISO6270 CH                     | No red rust                        |
| Exterior                   | Medium                     | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227                    | 5 cyc. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B         | NSS: No red rust                  |
| High & not visible for customer | High                     | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227                | 10 cyc. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B        | NSS: No red rust                  |
| High & visible customer    | High                       | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227                | 10 cyc. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B        | CCT: See below                    |

### Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT:  
1. **Rust Creep:**  
   - Galvanized Steel: d ≤ 4 mm.  
   - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1-2 mm.  
2. **Blistering:**  
   - Maximum blister size: S2 according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2.  
3. **Edge Corrosion:**  
   - ≤ 10%.
</page>

<page number="24">
**Weld seam corrosion:** ≤ 5%.  
**Degree of rusting:** ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

The interior is basically considered as a dry area, meaning an area with low corrosivity. Exceptions might include the floor area or areas where wetness/abrasion from shoes or drinking juices could produce corrosion.  

If combining different metals, avoid galvanic corrosion by coating such parts. Edges, especially painted edges, shall be burr-free for good edge coverage and to avoid wear.  

**Seat structure (uncoated blank steel):** At least new parts must be corrosion-free. Further, the areas with corrosion risk must not be visible to the customer. Consider extreme positions of the seat-rests. On other invisible areas, test criteria may also be lower than above mentioned, but it must be ensured that no corrosive products appear in visible areas, and the full function over the lifetime must be assured.  

**Vehicle tooling:** Usually stored in the trunk, considered to have low corrosivity exposure. For tool surfaces with wear, the corrosivity might be medium.  

**See also:** Corrosion requirements on electric components.

**Test plan**  
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VINFAST wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.  

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST.  

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly during the testing phase, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.  

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the component lies with the SDS. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The SDS has to ensure that VINFAST gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VINFAST can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VINFAST and SDS.  

If testing was done with incorrect parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the SDS's cost. In case of negative test results, the tests must be re-planned and retested, with the costs borne by the SDS if they are responsible for the failure.  

**Following data must be included in the DVP&R:**  
- Testing with declarations of standard, norm, and legal requirements.  
- Description of how and with which devices the testing was performed (including details of testing set-up with pictures).  
- Responsible test department.
</page>

<page number="25">
• Where the testing was performed (internal/external)  
• Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan)  
• Part variant, description of part  
• No. of tested components/parts  

The SDS is responsible to use the DVP&R template provided by VINFAST testing department. The content of the DVP&R is in the responsibility of the SDS.  
The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart) and serial stage.  
In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimen are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST.  
The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VINFAST departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department (VINFAST), SQA (VINFAST) and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.  
Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.  

### Testing  
#### General  
The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 0).  
It must be guaranteed, that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested!  
In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.  

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS have to be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered by the SDS from VINFAST.  

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.  

Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST test department, have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.  
The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for only his component. Moreover, has to be guaranteed that all internal VINFAST requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VINFAST.  

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved.  
All tests must be documented according to VINFAST standard, alternatively to SDS standard, if this is accepted by VINFAST.  
The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification.  
The tests have to be brought in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.
</page>

<page number="26">
Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time, or no later than the agreed-upon date coordinated with the test department. VINFAST Logistics determines the number of sample parts, and VINFAST Purchase orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS.

**Release by Test Departments**  
The responsible VINFAST test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the SDS and during the complete vehicle integration tests.  
The SDS must submit positive test reports for all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any problems (e.g., negative test results, wrong parameters/processes), the SDS must submit a test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions to keep all milestones and observe all targets.  
The OK or NOK result must be stated on the first sheet of the test report.

**Analyses and Test Reports**  
The SDS must provide measurement reports according to VINFAST specification (VFDST00008900) [43] in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts.  
After the individual tests, the test samples must be analyzed in detail. The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report must be handed over to the responsible VINFAST department for release.  
Upon request, the results, together with documentation of the tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development), must be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests carried out parallel to series production must be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.

**Test Report Information**  
The following information must be included in the test reports:  
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (including part number, change index, materials, production processes, additives such as grease, and any deviation from the approved serial process).  
- All parts must be labeled with descriptions.  
- Reason for testing in cases of negative test results, accompanied by earlier test reports.  
- Exact naming of testing standards, norms, legal requirements, or agreed testing procedures.
</page>

<page number="27">
**Documentation of result**  
- Short description of the result (pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of result OK/NOK, pictures of the parts in testing position, etc.)  
- Comparison with targets of the specification book, testing specification, legal requirements, ...  
- Recommendation  
- Description of corrective measures or further approach in case of negative test result  
- Progress of testing status  
- Listing of all tests in a table with responsible person, part status, comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the SDS has to give a new date for re-test with countermeasures to VINFAST for approval with responsible person and company to do the test.  

The VINFAST test engineer has to be informed in periodic intervals with actual status and progress. If VINFAST orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.  

**Archival storage of tested parts**  
Testing parts are only allowed to be scrapped if the VINFAST test department agrees to that. On the demand of the test engineer, the complete testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.  

**BIW-supports, testing devices, and -equipment**  
The number and configuration of the BIW supports are to be aligned with the testing department. The BIW supports are provided by VINFAST for the period of testing.  
The number and structures for testing (vibration testing device, devices for environmental testing, and long-term run structures) are to be aligned with the testing department.  
The evidence that all equipment for testing complies with corresponding testing instruction is to be proven by SDS.  

At least the following details need to be documented for all test samples and in testing reports:  
- Drawing Number  
- Part Number  
- Release Number  
- Change Index  
- Production and Delivery Date

- Documentation of the tool revision state  
- Measurement Report  
- DSR (Development Sample Report) VFDST00008800 [42]  

**Virtual testing**  
Suitable calculation methods are to be used and adequately detailed calculation models must be created by the SDS for the purpose of securing, verifying, and effectively optimizing the component properties defined in the technical specifications, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations.
</page>

<page number="28">
**Functional Responsibility**

**Mechanical Properties and FEM Calculations:**
The mechanical properties of the component, including rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, are to be secured using FEM calculations. Tool dimensioning for injection molding is to be optimized with corresponding simulations. Operative calculation models representing the respective development status must be made available to VINFAST technical departments upon request for internal calculations and integration work. Suitable FEM models must be provided at no extra cost, and SDS must calculatively document the tests from the evaluation plan before tool dimensioning.

**Component Testing:**
Basic required tests for components include:
- Climatic change test according to VFDST00046100 [35].
- Sunlight simulation per VFDST00053800 [37].
- Ageing of automotive components in solar simulation units DIN 75220 [13].
Detailed testing requirements will be defined in the DVP, which must be agreed upon and will be binding.

**Mechanical Integration Tests:**
Mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle include:
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100) [35].
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800) [37].
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000) [48].
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00008500) [36].

No distortion or functional disturbance across the functional temperature range is allowed. Components using materials with high and differing thermal expansion coefficients must maintain consistent behavior, and tolerances for flush and gap plans after tests must not be exceeded.

**Geometrical Integration:**
RPS (Reference Position System): Classification occurs within a functional area, ensuring a consistent, repeatable, and user-friendly determination of assembly and component parts. An RPS-concept must align with SE-process quality assurance and interior-/BIW-department standards (VFDST00000011 [34]). It establishes component positioning relative to adjoining parts.
</page>

<page number="29">
Tolerance analyses: The following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms.
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.

Arrangements are necessary in order to ensure the required gap dimension of components.

Sun visors: Verification of the sun visor folding.

Clearance Wiring Harness: A clearance of minimum 8mm to the wiring harness is required. Shape and position tolerances [15] and general tolerances [16] must be considered.
