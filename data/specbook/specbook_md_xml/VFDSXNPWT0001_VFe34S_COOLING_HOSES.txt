### 3 Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions  

For BEV vehicles, cooling hoses and pipes provide coolant flow (YA-992 is a mixture of ethylene glycol, unique inhibitors such as organic acids salts and tolyltriazole, and water (~ 93.3% EG – 3.9% inhibitors – 2.8% water) for DCDC, EDS (Electric Drive System), OBC (On Board Charger), and battery). The function of coolant hoses and pipes in a vehicle is to provide a flexible connection between moving components (e-motor) and fixed connections in the car (radiator, expansion tank, pumps, etc). The lines must permit the flow of coolant at a high temperature and must be flexible to absorb movements of the e-motor without ruptures or transmission of loads, minimizing significant flow restrictions. These lines are shaped and sized variably as per system requirements.  

#### Cooling Lines Functionality:  
The cooling lines distribute coolant between various components in the cooling and heating systems of the vehicle. The coolant circulates in the system where it undergoes continuous pressure and temperature fluctuations. Thus, functional requirements for cooling hoses are critical and detailed as follows:  
- **Securing to connections:** The hoses shall be secured to the connections with POPP-clamps (Pre Open Pre Position) or quick connectors.  
- **Efficient operation:** Cooling lines must operate efficiently in hot and stressful environments involving heat, pressure/vacuum, and blow-by gases, which can induce rapid heat aging in many plastic and rubber materials.  
- **Flexible connections:** Flexible connections are required to isolate e-motor vibration and noise from the ducting system. These connections should be configured for maximum allowable offset and compression to prevent early failure and excess forces on the turbocharger and air inlet components.  
- **Movement absorption:** Certain hoses shall take up movement between the e-motor and other components in the cooling system. Cooling lines should be flexible to withstand e-motor rolling conditions.  
- **Debris cleaning and material durability:** Cooling lines must be cleaned of all debris, ensuring hose material integrity so debris does not loosen during prolonged operation and enter the system. The exterior of the hose should be cleaned using standard commercial washing agents.  
- **Fluorosilicone coating:** Hoses should have Fluorosilicone coating on the interior surface to resist oil and coolant, adding a protection layer against hose deterioration.  
- **Quick connector availability:** Quick connectors in cooling lines should be readily available at car service stations as complete hose assemblies or replaceable with high accuracy and care.

### Temperatures and Pressures  
The temperature of the coolant in the BEV E-drive and heating loops may range between -30°C and 95°C. The ambient air temperature may range from -40°C to 105°C. Normal working temperatures are below 90°C. At soak, ambient temperature could reach 105°C, and coolant temperature reaches 90°C. Pressure in the system may vary from -10 kPa to 100 kPa overpressure.
