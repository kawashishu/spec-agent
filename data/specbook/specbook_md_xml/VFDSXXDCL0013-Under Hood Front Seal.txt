Suppliers must respond timely to failure reports encountered during vehicle system integration and certification. Any changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved through the PPAP process.  
- Component or subsystem integration and certification are the responsibility of the supplier. Suppliers must ensure all tests for their components/subsystems are completed.  
- Parts and subsystems may be certified by the supplier, sub-suppliers, or third parties upon VINFAST’s approval.  
- Suppliers are obligated to complete all testing requirements as specified.  
- Suppliers must provide VINFAST’s product release engineer with a detailed component/subsystem test certification plan, including number of samples, test sequence, location, and timeline for execution.  

##### 1.1.2 General Description of the System / Component.  
It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements.

### Defects and Quality Standards  

13. **Joint defect**  
The joint shall be firm without obvious glue overflow. The joint step shall be allowed to exist, but the unevenness shall not exceed 0.3mm. The width shall not be greater than 3mm, and no obvious color difference is permitted.  

14. **Out of mark**  
- **Category B**: It's not allowed to exist.  
- **Category a**: It is allowed to exist, but the width of defects shall not exceed 0.2mm.  

**Additional Notes:**  
1. **Categories of defects**:  
   - _Category a_: Indicates a serious or minor defect.  
   - _Category A/B_: If not indicated for the defect position, the defect can appear regardless of location.  
2. A part of the defect highlights visible belt surface defects of rubber products.  
3. _Category B_: Refers to defects on the visible surface of non-belt areas of pressed rubber products.  
4. For components matching the interior decoration, any requirements related to texture or color must reference the relevant color plate.  
5. Products with bright stripes must have protective films. After tearing off the protective film, residual glue must not affect the appearance.  
6. For products with injection heads, the drawings contain special requirements for surface differences between the injection head and seal body.

<page number="16">
 Marking scheme to party A for approval. Relevant requirements shall be in accordance with the parts drawings and party A's provisions on auto parts identification.

 Party B shall hang the barcode on the accurately traced parts specified by party A, and the coding rules and relevant requirements shall be implemented in accordance with the parts drawings and party A's provisions on the identification of auto parts.

 Party B shall obtain the written consent of party A in advance for special cases in which marking is not allowed or part of the marking is not allowed. Party B shall be responsible for the claim retroactively for the three packages of the supporting parts and after-sales parts or provide the way of record identification.

 Party B shall not stamp or paste party B's explicit information (such as its own trademark, name, etc.) on the products (special circumstances, subject to written approval of party A).

### Product quality rectification responsibility:
- If party B is responsible for the design and manufacturing of spare parts, it shall be solely responsible for the rectification of product quality (including design, mold, process, etc.) except for modeling changes.

- If party A (or a third party) undertakes the design and party B undertakes the manufacturing, party B shall organize the review and countersignature of the design data before accepting the design data. Once the design data freeze countersignature form is signed, party B shall be solely responsible for the rectification of product quality (including design, mold, process, etc.) except for modeling changes.

- The newly put into production of molds must go through the production verification stage to ensure the matching accuracy of parts and components with the whole vehicle. Mold adjustment for solving the problem of vehicle coordination is not an engineering change. The supplier shall control the production quantity of the sample as required, actively cooperate, and bear the corresponding mold adjustment costs.

- Party B shall, with respect to the split parts that have been specifically negotiated for after-sales maintenance, ensure that the product performance, structure, and appearance quality meet the same requirements of the assembly parts and submit the product qualification certificate.

The supplier must ensure that the developed parts comply with VN regulations and VINFAST specifications, obtain component type approval, and submit all necessary documents to support vehicle type approval.

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.  
AAR is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing). For each step of the process, the Supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval. The process starts in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS. The Supplier must include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.

4. Function Safety, Homologation and Safety Regulations.  
Safety is one of the key issues in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety is concerned with E/E systems.

## Supplier Responsibilities  
**Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier Responsibilities are itemised to help mitigate the risk to the organisation of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.**  

### Customer service requirements  
**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**
</page>

<page number="23">
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need to ensure life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST's end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).
