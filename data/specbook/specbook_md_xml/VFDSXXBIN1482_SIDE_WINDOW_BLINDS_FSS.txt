</page>

<page number="8">
**3.6 Labeling of Parts**  
Suppliers must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Suppliers are required to create figures that display the position of labels on parts, including set-up pictures outlining the label location.

**3.7 Testing and Validation and DVP&R**  
Testing and validation responsibilities align with RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) must be conducted at the system, subsystem, and component levels in accordance with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase. Suppliers must prepare a detailed test plan for hardware tests, which is to be outlined in the DVP&R document, in collaboration with the Testing & Validation department. The plan should include:
- Declaration of applicable standards, norms, and legal requirements.
- Descriptions of testing methods and devices, including visual documentation (e.g., pictures).
- Information regarding the location of testing (internal/external).
- Duration and timeline for testing presented as a project plan.
- Variants and descriptions of the tested part.
- The quantity of tested components/parts.  

Suppliers must ensure a mileage target life of 160,000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first). Reference document: F07.VF36_VFe36_DVPR_Component_format_V3.1.xlsx (included as a separate attachment).

**3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for All Visible Parts**  
Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is detailed in VFDST00038401, covering the quantity of parts and timing requirements. Suppliers are responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design for approval, following agreed timelines for OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  
The process begins early during the PT phase to secure AAR Approval at LS. Suppliers must accommodate this activity within their development process and ED&D cost.
