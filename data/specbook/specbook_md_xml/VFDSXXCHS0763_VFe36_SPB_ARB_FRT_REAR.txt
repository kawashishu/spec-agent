  The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances, along with notification obligations, must be ensured by the supplier for new and carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, spare parts, and modified components throughout the complete product life cycle according to VFDST00007601.  

- **IMDS Requirements:**   
  IMDS material data sheets should be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID per the VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and standard VFDST00007601. Specific targets for vehicle indoor air quality are defined in the VFDSXVCVC3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline.  

- **Material validation:**  
  - Material must fulfill the required material validation test according to DRAWING and Specbook.  
  - Each material must meet VinFast-defined standards for material requirements.  
  - A table of material test matrix must be developed by the supplier and confirmed by VinFast.  

**3.5 Traceability**  
Part requirements must align with specification standards outlined in VFDST00010501. However, ARB_MOUNT_CLAMP_RR (CHS80017154) is excluded from this standard's compliance.  

**3.6 Labeling of Parts**

**4 Testing and validation and DVP&R**  
Testing and validation responsibilities follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for systems, subsystems, and components must align with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase.  

Detailed test plans for hardware tests must be documented in the DVP&R file under the Testing & Validation department's direction:  
- Testing must comply with declared standards, norms, and legal requirements.  
- Include descriptions and images of equipment or devices used for testing setup.  
- Specify whether testing occurred internally or externally.

4. Testing and validation and DVP&R  
DVP and PC test responsibility must follow RASIC. DVP, encompassing virtual and physical testing, must address System, Sub-system, and Component Level in alignment with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase. A detailed test plan for hardware tests must be outlined in the file DVP&R and coordinated with the Testing & Validation department.

- A complete part variant and description must be included.  
- Details on the number of tested components or parts must be submitted.

Suppliers must ensure Mileage Target Life: 160,000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first). Refer to the detailed DVP test specification in DVP documentation.

### 4.1 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts  
AAR is classified as a PPAP deliverable.  

The AAR process is described in document VFDST00038401 and includes guidelines on the quantity and timing of parts. Suppliers are responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design at each stage of the process to ensure OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval within agreed timing.  

The process begins in the early PT build phase and aims to secure AAR Approval at LS.  

Suppliers must integrate this activity into their development process and account for it within their ED&D costs.

7 Supplier responsibilities.
The supplier is responsible for providing and ensuring specific commitments while completing the work. These responsibilities are itemized to mitigate the risk of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

### Customer service requirements:
#### After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

#### Spare Parts Support Cycle.
The support period of after-sales spare parts must ensure the life cycles of the project and meet the requirements outlined in the General Term and Condition (GTC) after VINFAST ends production of the vehicle, except as specified in this Spare Parts Bulletin (SPB).

#### Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST's after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before Off-Tool Sample (OTS). This includes the BOM table, parts structure and function descriptions, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters such as installation clearances and parts performance specifications.
