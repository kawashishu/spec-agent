3.2.4 Performance Requirement

3.2.4.1 Damage Resistance  
The supplier must document all subsystem level specifications in support of requirements for damage resistance during vehicle operation.  

The following is a minimum list of expected specifications:  
- The supplier must also document all HVAC RR AUXILIARY DUCTS specifications in support of requirements for damage resistance during vehicle service and assembly.  
- Specifications for the components to withstand dropping or falling over.  
- Specifications for components to withstand temporary loading associated with misalignment during assembly or service.  
- Easily accessible gripping locations shall not break off during part handling.  

The supplier shall detail verification tests for these specifications with prototype vehicles.  

3.2.4.2 Noise and Vibration Requirements  

**General: Complete Vehicle NVH and Driving Comfort Targets**  
The vehicle shall enable acoustics and vibration comfort which shall be well balanced with vehicle dynamics and drivability so that long-distance driving comfort as well as driving over rough road is neither exhausting nor annoying. This requires the absolute absence of squeak and rattle issues under all load cases (speed, maneuver, temperature).  

**Supplier Responsibility**  
The validation of NVH and driving comfort will be done on a complete vehicle level and comprises real customer operation conditions. Before the validation on a complete vehicle level takes place, the supplier has to ensure the readiness of the components respectively the system for durability and general testing.  

The evidence for the test maturity of the components has to be reported in the DVP&R at the component level.  

System suppliers are requested to perform validation activities as specified in respective technical specifications. All parts required for validation activities are specified by DVP&R and shall meet the required maturity level. VinFast will define quality criteria and validation methods for alignment with suppliers.  

In general, it is mandatory for the supplier to support the NVH development process and the complete product cycle as well. The support comprises intensive and active cooperation with the development team and manufacturing regarding root cause investigations.  

The supplier has to consider and support the achievement of complete vehicle NVH targets (objective and subjective targets) at the component and system level.  

All components have to be free of squeak and rattle noises to avoid psychoacoustic annoyance during all operation conditions of the vehicle including audio acoustic excitation.  

The robustness of the design has to be assured and reported virtually and in the hardware phase before serial release. The sound of actuation noises must not be audible and must represent a high-quality impression integrated into the complete vehicle.  

The requirements are to be performed in all specified environmental and thermic conditions. During serial manufacturing, a capable quality assurance process has to be established to ensure the quality level.  

The supplier has to provide components for testing and NVH tuning and ensures the participation of specialists during local testing and troubleshooting processes.  

**HVAC RR AUXILIARY DUCTS Modal Frequency**  
The design of the HVAC RR AUXILIARY DUCTS must enable meeting a TBD [40 Hz] mounting modal frequency.  

The HVAC RR AUXILIARY DUCTS, as mounted on the vehicle, modal performance (flexural or rigid body frequencies) shall achieve TBD [40 Hz] unless the VinFast Engineering team agrees to a deviation consistent with the program-specific vehicle mode map.  

**HVAC RR AUXILIARY DUCTS Squeak and Rattle Requirements**  
The requirement for this program is to have absolutely no customer annoyance due to squeaks and rattles.  

The final authority for the determination of whether a noise is objectionable lies with VinFast HVAC systems and/or the Squeak and Rattle (S&R) Engineers.  

Squeaks and rattles include, but are not limited to, all the noises described in the “Squeak & Rattle Noise Glossary.”  

The supplier is to accept full responsibility to produce squeak and rattle-free, “as delivered,” subsystems and/or components.  

The supplier shall also cooperate with VinFast Engineering and/or other suppliers to assure that no squeak and rattle annoyances occur at the interface of their subsystem/component to the body, interior, or other subsystem/component.  

If an objectionable noise is found during any phase of the program, it will be the supplier’s responsibility, with VinFast Engineering cooperation, to eliminate the noise and demonstrate resolution in a vehicle prior to exiting the program phase.  

If the noise is found in pilot or production, the supplier will be responsible for developing a containment plan (and fix), as well as short- and long-term solutions, as appropriate.  

Any issue raised during these processes, which is demonstrated to be the responsibility of the supplier, shall be corrected with urgency at no additional cost to VinFast.  

The supplier will be responsible for the Squeak & Rattle performance of their subsystem.

Evaluation of operating interior parts due to changes caused by customer-related handling in the vehicle lifetime. The climatic chamber, which can reach the required temperature and humidity values, must be chosen.

**Test mission:**

Examination of indicated characteristic values, evaluation of new properties, and changes due to the simulation of lifetime demands on interior parts.

**Evaluation and release of testing parts by SDS according to the following criteria:**
- Geometric changes
- Surface issues
- Changes of functionality
- Failures or fractures
- Cracks or crazes  

Deformations are only allowed if the function and the appearance are not affected. Breaks, tears, surface changes, or other damages in the operating sectors are not allowed. Changes in characteristics (e.g., control forces, opening times, etc.) must correspond to given requirements.  

**Test coverage:**
Test set-up with parts made of representative serial material, process, geometry, and surface (paint, coating). Different variants and optional equipment must be included.  

**Tests to be done:**

**Function tests:**
- **Room temperature:** 23°C ± 5°C evaluation of function, force, and speed.
- **Low temperature (Vietnam Market):** -5°C evaluation of function only.
- **Low temperature (US Market):** -20°C evaluation of function only.
- **High temperature:** 60°C evaluation of function only.

The function tests under low and high temperatures must be performed after a conditioning period of 1 hour at the required temperature.

**Durability run:**  
All movable parts must be tested for 7500 cycles at the following conditions:
- Room temperature: 23°C ±5°C - 1875 cycles.
- Low temperature (Vietnam Market): -5°C - 1875 cycles.
- Low temperature (US Market): -20°C - 1875 cycles.
- High temperature: 60°C - 1875 cycles.
- Room temperature: 23°C ±5°C - 1875 cycles with the last 50% of the runtime exposed to dust.

Before and after the durability run, the function, force, and speed must be measured. Recording of special items such as:
- Strength – deformation
- Strength – temperature – deformation in selected measuring points at specific temperatures.

**Misuse run:**
Misuse conditions must be defined together with VinFast (VF) and SDS.

**Room temperature:** 23°C ±5°C - 1875 cycles  
**Low temperature (Vietnam Market):** -5°C - 1875 cycles  
**Low temperature (US Market):** -20°C - 1875 cycles  
**High temperature:** 60°C - 1875 cycles  
**Room temperature:** 23°C ±5°C - 1875 cycles (last 50% of runtime with dust exposure).

**Evaluation test results:**
- No cracks.
- No signs of blistering or flaking of the main layer or sub layer.
- No dismantling, squeak, or rattle.
- For main function parts, function checks and documentation must be done.  
  *(Exception: parts with a specific testing standard).*

**Torque:**
The continuing torque must be documented. Exceptions are microencapsulated screws; for this case, the breakaway torque must be measured.

**Screw Joints (when applicable):**
- **Metal/metal:** A continuing torque of ≥ 60% from the starting torque is acceptable.
- **Metal/plastic:** Every torque is acceptable unless the screw is loose or unable to turn further.
- **Plastic/plastic:** Every torque is acceptable unless the screw is loose or unable to turn further.

**Stiffness Testing of Interior Parts**

**Evaluation of Mechanical Properties**

**Test-Mission**
Evaluation and release of testing parts by the SDS must be handled according to the following criteria:
- Geometric changes.
- Surface issues.
- Changes in functionality.
- Failures or fractures.
- Cracks or crazes.

Deformations are permissible only if the function and appearance are unaffected. Breaks, tears, surface changes, or other damages in the operating sectors are not allowed. Changes in characteristics (e.g., control forces, opening times) must correspond to the given requirements.

Determination of measurement points for pressure and strength values, as well as deformation measurement points, are balanced in the DVP&R.

Parts can either be built in vehicles or testing devices.

---

**Mechanical Integration Tests**

The following tests will be conducted as part of mechanical integration in a complete car:
- **Climatic change test** (VFDST00046100).
- **Sunlight simulation** (VFDST00053800).
- **Mounting/dismounting** (VFDST00009000).
- **Vibration combined with temperature** (VFDST00008500).

No distortion or functional disturbance is permitted across the entire functional temperature range. Particular attention must be paid to maintaining the behavior of materials with high and varying thermal expansion coefficients.

Flush and gap tolerances must not exceed the specified limits after the climatic change and sun simulation tests.

These component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP, which must be agreed upon between VinFast and the SDS and will be binding.

If VinFast orders parts for testing independently, detailed part descriptions must be included.

**3.9 Reliability**  
This section contains the reliability requirements for the HVAC RR AUXILIARY DUCTS. Reliability is defined as the probability of a product performing its intended function(s) in a manner that meets customer expectations, for a given period of time and/or miles, under stated conditions.

**Reliability Evaluation Point (REP)**  
The REP of the HVAC RR AUXILIARY DUCTS is 10 years or 160,000 Km (whichever comes first) of severe customer usage at a vehicle level.  
If the subject vehicle program has a higher/different REP, it will be necessary to work with VinFast validation engineer to modify the test procedure to represent the new REP.  

**Reliability Requirements (Applies to both Design Validation and Product Validation)**  
- Reliability demonstration profiles, as a minimum, shall be consistent with the severe customer usage.  
- If the test severity cannot be determined, then the component shall demonstrate that it is capable of exceeding reliability of the best-in-segment component as selected by VinFast Engineering team.  
- The following HVAC RR AUXILIARY DUCTS reliability shall be R97 or greater at a 50% confidence (R97C50) at the REP.
