- Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm
- Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm

Blistering:
- Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2)

Edge corrosion:
- ≤ 10%

Weld seam corrosion:
- ≤ 5%

Degree of rusting:
- ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3)

**Stainless steel**
- Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion), in most cases an insulating coating is needed.
- Test criteria for high visible parts: 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check especially areas with crevices.
- Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

**Aluminum parts**
- Aluminum parts in high visible areas have to be painted or anodized.
- Test criteria for Painted Aluminum: see test criteria for organic coatings.
- Test criteria for Anodized Aluminum: 480 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.
- Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

**Chromed metal parts**

**Electric parts**
- Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex), when in wet locations.
</page>

<page number="14">
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.

Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion. Terminals and connectors must not be placed in the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals requires tightness as a priority: Electrical connections must be protected from humidity. Grounding connections must be water-tight if placed in corrosive environments.

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are highly sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal quickly, compromising moisture resistance.

### Prevention of stone chipping issues
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized through design measures:
- Provide shielding parts for easily damageable regions wherever possible.
- Enlarge radii of parts in high-risk areas to prevent severe issues.
- Use materials and paints of the same color in high stone-hitting-risk areas to camouflage abrasion marks.
- Avoid designing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements in the lower vehicle areas, recess them to reduce their exposure to stone hits.

### Supplier responsibilities
The system supplier is responsible for:
- Defining and confirming all materials.
- Ensuring that assemblies and components are developed for economical recycling of materials at the end of the vehicle’s life.
- Preparing a recycling concept.

Only approved materials for each application from the European automotive industry may be used.

### Material and design guidelines
- Components must be designed to avoid production-related surface flaws/defects such as tool parting lines, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, and stress zones.
- Material-compliant fits, curvatures, and corners should allow parallel joint alignment and offset-free surfaces.
- Component edges, corners, and ribs must be uniform, proportionally accurate, and material-compliant for a smooth design conclusion.

3.6 Traceability. For part requirements, follow specification as specified in VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

3.7 NVH and Driving Comfort. Vibrational comfort, acoustic behavior, and isolation function of components need to meet defined standards. Suppliers should ensure that all supplied components are free of noticeable noise during vehicle operation. Quality evaluation will be based on VF’s subjective evaluation scale (e.g., customer satisfaction rated as "fair," equivalent to a 7 on the VF scale).
</page>

<page number="16">
Vehicle Safety.  
The supplier is responsible to support the integration of vehicle safety functions actively. Lifetime relevant laws and Ratings of selling markets as well as OEM requirements must be taken into account.

### General demands
Unless further specific definitions will be given, following points must be considered by the supplier:
- Vehicle safety functions must be maximum prepared by on system level by expertise, CAE, and testing.
- Project relevant supplier data must be handed over to VF on request and free of charge. VF is allowed to forward this to other parties within the project.
- Target fulfilment of performances with spread effects must be secured by an adequate number of worst results of identical test series’ results.
- Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand, e.g., to support and reach vehicle data freeze milestones. It must be realized within LsDyna, as well as validated, numerical, and physical stable.
- FE meshes must be homogeneous, according to part axles/geometry and with a density of 8-10mm. In case of non-keeping meshing guidelines, FE meshes must be reworked.
- For generating validated CAE material cards, activities must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier. This includes principle tests on system as well as components.
- Supplier's test matrix must be defined according to full vehicle timing demands; before higher scaled tests are planned to be done (as sled or vehicle crash tests) supplier optimization test series must be completed.
- Supplier-specific parts, which are needed for testing activities at any party of the project, must be provided by the supplier free of charge to the relevant testing facilities. However, in case of upcoming costs for physical parts and CAE models needed by the supplier, cost must be taken into account by the supplier.
- Integration of requests pointed out from the full vehicle crash optimizations process at VF must be accepted without add-on costs; e.g., material definitions, material thicknesses, additional parts, optimizations work.

### General requirements
- For each single target value, a mandatory 20% safety margin has to be applied.
- Occupant survival area integrity vs. part behavior and fluids; this includes parts that are directly and not directly in contact with any passengers.
- No edges below 3.2mm during and after impact.
- Electrical system integrity during impact and for post-crash functions.
- Consideration of relevant tolerances.
- Robust target achievement.
- Asymmetries must be investigated on each side, until a reliable worst case is confirmed by VF.
- No modifiers for any Rating.

Additionally, specific demands are given:
- Without claim to be complete.

Version: 9  

### Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability)

- Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions (operating loads and special events).
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile.
- Definition of all requirements to ensure sufficient operational strength of the complete vehicle, sub-systems, and components, which serves as the basis for all system and component technical specifications.
- Mounting force must be lower than dismounting force.

### Operating Loads
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the base reference vehicles on tracks defined by VF.  

- The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for MCE (Mixed Circuit Europe = long-distance durability run).  
- The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car: **160,000 km**.
- The vehicle lifetime shall be at least **10 years**.

**Environmental operating conditions:**
- Ambient temperatures: -30°C to +50°C.  
- Relative humidity: 0% - 100%.  
- Elevation: -100m to 3500m above mean sea level.

### Special Events
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. <100) that belong to the intended use of the vehicle (e.g., ABS-braking).  

**Requirements:**
- The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect functionality.  
- No safety-relevant damages should occur.  
- The intended **service life** must remain unaffected.  

### Misuse Events
Misuse events are those outside the intended vehicle usage intentions (e.g., curbstone impact).  

**Design Standards:**
- Damages after misuse must be clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions).  
- A defined damage chain must prioritize easy replaceable parts before body structure components.  
- Cracks or damages must only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or neighboring components (principle: deformation before break).

**Weight Management**

Because the vehicle weight has a significant influence on energy consumption, the primary goal of weight management is to minimize the total vehicle weight. Throughout development, focus must remain on a weight-optimized design for all components, with suppliers required to demonstrate weight reduction potentials and their impact on cost, timing, and quality. The maximum system weight target is specified as:

- C-CUV: TBD kg without fluid.

---

**Vehicle Architecture & Ergonomics**

The complete vehicle must meet requirements outlined in vehicle layout plans. Any changes to parts or modules affecting vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence must be immediately communicated to VinFast (VF) by the supplier for separate evaluation. Definitions and technical geometric specifications for complete vehicle dimensions in both interior and exterior are established per GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.

---

**Styling Technique Convergence**

Any changes to parts or modules that affect exterior and/or interior styling surfaces must be reported to VF immediately by the supplier for evaluation. Suppliers are responsible for providing technical input necessary for styling evolution loops (e.g., tooling demands, assembly sequences) based on VF module leads’ defined requirements. Technical input may include office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.

---

**Tightness**

**The complete vehicle must pass the following tests:**
- Wading tests with varying wading depths up to maximum depth.
- Splash tests at various water depths and speeds.
- Rain tests with different water flow rates and vehicles positioned at tilted angles.
- Wash tests covering all possible washing methods, including high pressure.
- Dust driving tests.
- Wet pollution tests, simulating driving on wet roads behind lead vehicles.
- Icing tests, involving cooling a wet vehicle down to -20°C in a chamber.

**Basic requirements for tightness based on complete vehicle tests:**
- No function-relevant leakage throughout vehicle life.
- Water must not enter the cabin, including HVAC systems.
- Dust entrance with open windows must remain below defined levels, as per tightness requirements.
- Customer satisfaction with washability must be ensured.
- Passage through water pools at high and low speeds must not cause damage to the vehicle.
- The function must remain unimpaired following complete vehicle tightness tests.
- Effects such as pollution or dripping water must not cause customer dissatisfaction.

### Emissions & Toxicology

#### Harmful substances in components and materials
The emission behavior of the product has to be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment have to be minimized accordingly. Required measurements for confirmation of the emission characteristics have to be done by the supplier in agreement with the specialist department of VF. The measurements have to be done at testing institutes approved by VF. It is recommended to obtain an overview of all approved testing institutes from VF. Additional requirements can be found in project-specific documents (e.g., Emission Guideline).

Volatile organic compounds of components have to be checked according to ISO12219. The conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured through the complete product life cycle. The test result is evaluated by the specialist department of VF. In any case, the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health has to be attested in written form on demand. The supplier has to provide measurement results regarding VOC and fogging for the materials before the milestone purchase release.

---

### Recycling

#### Recycled materials
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’). Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert’s team at VF.

#### Recycling scheme
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental expert’s team at VF before the milestone PTO (Production Try-Out).

---

### Drainage and Depollution
Complete drainage of fluids is required for safe and environmentally friendly End-of-Life vehicle treatment. For complete removal of fluids, niches and pockets shall be avoided.
</page>

<page number="23">
Drainage scheme including virtual or physical test protocol with information on type of drained fluids, amount of drained fluids (in weight-%) and absolute mass of drained fluid in kg has to be provided to the environmental experts team at VF before milestone PTO Production Try-Out. 

Material Requirements & Corrosion

Generally:  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (de-icing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (de-icing) salts.  
3. **High corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very high corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  

Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in the lowest positions.  

Corrosion Tests:  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

Component test for Metallic surfaces:  
- **Salt spray test:** ISO 9227, acceptance criteria see below  

For Organic coatings:  
- **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT):** ISO 11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below  

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.  

Aluminium/sealing surfaces:  
Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Reason: Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.  

Test Criteria:  
- **Area:** Interior, mounted parts, dry area  
- **Corrosivity:** Low  
- **Metallic coatings:** 240 h NSS → ISO 9227  
- **Organic coatings:** 96 h → ISO 6270 CH  
- **Pass criteria:** No red rust

### 3.9.3.2 Release by Test Departments
The responsible VF test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved from the B2P SUP and during the complete vehicle integration tests.

The B2P SUP must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any problems (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the B2P SUP must submit a test report, must be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions (to keep all milestones and observe all targets). "OK" or "NOK" results need to be stated on the first sheet of the report.

### 3.9.3.3 Analyses, Test Reports
The B2P SUP has to provide measurement reports (VFDST00008900) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during the prototype generations. After the individual tests, the test samples have to be analyzed in detail.

The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report has to be handed over to the responsible VF department for release. Upon request, the results, together with the documentation of the tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development), are to be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release.

Tests carried out parallel to series production are to be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.

**3.9.4 Test-report/-information**
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (part no., change index, materials, production process, additives like grease and every deviation from approved serial process).
- All parts have to be labeled with description.
- Eventually the reason for testing in case of e.g. negative test results and attachment of earlier test reports.
- Testing with exact naming of testing standard, norm, legal requirement or exact description of agreed testing procedure.

**3.9.5 Documentation of Result**
- Short description of the result (pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of result OK/NOK, pictures of the parts in testing position, etc.).
- Comparison with results of the specification book, testing specification, legal requirements, etc.
- Recommendation.
- Description of corrective measures or further approach in case of negative test result.
- Progressional testing status.
- Listing of all tests in a table with responsible person, part status, comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the B2P SUP has to give a new date for re-test with countermeasures to VF for approval with responsible person and company to do the test.

The VF test engineer must be informed within 2 working days in the event of negative test results. The VF test engineer has to be informed in periodic intervals with actual status and progress. If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.

**3.9.6 Archival Storage of Tested Parts**
Testing parts are only allowed to be scrapped if the VinFast test department agrees to that. On demand of the test engineer, the complete testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.

**3.9.7 Virtual Testing**
Suitable calculation methods are to be used and adequately detailed calculation models created by the B2P SUP for the purpose of securing, verifying, and effectively optimizing the component properties defined in the technical specification, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations. The requirements related to the mechanical properties of the component in particular such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety are to be secured by means of FEM calculations.

The tool-dimensioning for the injection molding is to be optimized by corresponding simulations. On request, the operative calculation models that represent the respective development status are to be made available at any time to the requesting technical departments of VF for the purpose of internal calculations and integration work.

On request from VinFast, the B2P SUP has to provide suitable FEM models without extra cost.
