3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.  
AAR is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing). For each step of the process, the supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval. The process will start in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS. The supplier has to include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.

4 Function Safety, Homologation and Safety Regulations.  
Safety is one of the key issues in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety is concerned with E/E systems.

4.1 Functional Safety Requirements.  
The supplier shall ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet IATF 16949:2016 standard, Quality management system requirements for automotive production. The supplier shall ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet ISO 26262:2018 standard, Road vehicles - Functional safety.

< MGL and FUSA to add here reference to system-specific Functional Safety Requirements document. >

<page number="10">
4.3.1 North America.

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities. 
The supplier must ensure that their parts, products, or systems comply with applicable regulations, including European standards, Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS), and Canadian motor vehicle safety standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support necessary documentation for submission to relevant authorities. 

b. Self-certification and test reports. 
The supplier is responsible for "self-certifying" parts, products, or systems to meet applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before products are offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct specified tests in certain FMVSS/CMVSS, and test reports must be submitted as evidence of compliance. The supplier must be familiar with laboratory test procedures used by USA/Canada governments to evaluate compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS. Refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer Handbook for further details.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations. 
If a supplier determines a non-compliance or safety-related defect exists in motor vehicle equipment, they must notify VinFast within five working days. Suppliers must propose appropriate risk assessments and resolution plans.

<page number="11">
4.3.2 Europe.

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.  
The Supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.

b. Test report(s) and Certificate(s).  
The supplier is responsible for ensuring their part(s), product(s), or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before offering those products for sale.  
VinFast requests the Supplier to conduct tests as specified in certain UN-ECE regulations at authorized technical services. The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  

VinFast also requests the Supplier to provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings to be submitted to the relevant authorities in order to obtain certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any).  

The Supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations.  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  

The Supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

6 Supplier responsibilities.
Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier Responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

### Customer service requirements.
#### After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

#### Spare Parts Support Cycle.
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need to ensure life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.

#### Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).

7 Intellectual Property / Copyright.
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).

8 Insurance / Warranties.
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).
