7 Supplier responsibilities.
The supplier is responsible for providing/ensuring completion of work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk arising from an employer–employee relationship under the contract.

**Customer service requirements.**  
- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
  Suppliers must ensure spare parts are available at the beginning of the whole vehicle production.  

- **Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
  Suppliers shall ensure the after-sales spare parts support period covers the life cycles of the project and meets requirements in the General Terms and Conditions (GTC) beyond VINFAST's termination of whole vehicle production except as stated in this SPB.  

- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
  Before OTS, the supplier of first-level assembly is required to provide VINFAST’s after-sales engineering department with documentation about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly. Such information includes:  
    - Bill of Materials (BOM) table.  
    - Parts structure and function descriptions.  
    - Fault diagnosis.  
    - Special tools for maintenance.  
    - Relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearances and parts performance parameters).
