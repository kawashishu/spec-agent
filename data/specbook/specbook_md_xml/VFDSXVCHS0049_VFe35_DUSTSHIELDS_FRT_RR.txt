### 3.2.1 Functional Content
All sharp edges and corners must be removed. 3D CAD is to be used as the master. All dimensions apply to the finished product and are in millimeters. Unless otherwise specified, the minimum bend radius should equal the material thickness. Maximum allowable thinning after drawing or bending must not exceed 20% of the nominal thickness of the sheet.

For unspecified tolerances, refer to VFDST00000013. Requirements regarding declarable or prohibited substances are aligned with the Global Automotive Declarable Substances List (GADSL). LH and RH parts are symmetrical. The sheet material thickness is 0.8mm. Workpiece edges must adhere to DIN ISO 13715. Surface coating must be gray paint or E-coat. Product surface treatment must ensure compliance with Neutral Salt Spray (NSS) testing as per ISO 9227 for a duration of 720 hours.

General drawing requirements must follow standard VFDST00009901. General tolerances must adhere to standard VFDST00000013. The Reference Point System (RPS) must comply with standard VFDST00000011. The design must protect the brake system (caliper/brake disc) against coarse contamination and failure.

### 3.2.2 Brake Fluid
Brake shields must be resistant to the following brake fluids:
1. DOT 3
2. DOT 4

### 3.2.3 Target Life
The target life is 100,000 miles (160,900 km) or 10 years, whichever comes first. Compliance with durability requirements will be assessed through severe levels of customer usage (99.8%) over 100,000 miles plus 10 years of severe environmental exposure.

<page number="12">
3.3 General CAE Requirements. Refer to SOR VFSRXVCVC0201 and VFCAE-001-FEM-GENERAL_Analysis Requirement.

3.4 Material Requirement.  
The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances, emissions, and toxicology must be ensured throughout the complete product life cycle for all parts—new, modified, carry-over, off-the-shelve, or spare parts. Suppliers must adhere to standards VFDST00007601 and submit IMDS material data sheets into VinFast IMDS ID as outlined in VinFast IMDS guidelines. Specific targets for vehicle indoor air quality are defined under VFDSXVCVC3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline.

3.5 Traceability.  
Follow specification for part requirements detailed in VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

3.6 Labeling of Parts.  
Suppliers must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010, and include a representation showing the position of labels on parts (including pictures).

3.7 Testing and Validation and DVP&R.  
Testing responsibilities are outlined in RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) is required on system, sub-system, and component levels. Testing must align with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase. Suppliers must generate detailed test plans for hardware testing in the DVP&R file and coordinate with Testing & Validation departments. Testing processes must cover: 
- Declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirements.

b. Test report(s) and Certificate(s).
The supplier is responsible for ensuring their part(s), product(s), or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests Suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain of the UN-ECE at authorized technical service(s). The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance. VinFast also requests the Supplier to provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings, to be submitted to the relevant authorities in order to obtain certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any). The Supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.
