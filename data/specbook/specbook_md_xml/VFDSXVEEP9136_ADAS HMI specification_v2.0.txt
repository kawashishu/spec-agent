Lane Keep Assist (LKA) is a driver assistance system that supports the driver to maintain the vehicle within its driving lane by counter steering. It hereby aims to prevent the vehicle departing its lane when the vehicle unintentionally drifts towards the lane lines when the driver is not paying attention, to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. LKA system is activated from the ADAS options in the settings.

Requirement ID:  
HMI-190987  
Type: --  
Status: New  

Head Up Display (HUD) details for LDW and LKA features. Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Lane Keep Assist (LKA) utilize HUD to visually alert the driver with speed and lane status indicators. Key aspects of the HUD visualization include:
  
1. **OFF**:  
   - No warnings are displayed when LDW and LKA are inactive.  
   - Systems are off, normal driving conditions apply.

2. **1 Lane Marking Detected**:  
   - HUD displays one lane marking detected. An icon shows action prompts if the lane assist feature activates.  

3. **Lane Deviation Warning (LDW)**:  
   - If the vehicle deviates and lane markings are detected, HUD provides precise visual indicators.  
   - Warning issued visually alongside corresponding system sound alerts.  

4. **Hands on Wheel Request**:  
   - Includes alerts on the HUD requesting the driver’s hands to return to the steering wheel to regain control.  

5. **Status Change**:  
   - HUD indicates system activation or deactivation of LDW and LKA status.  

6. **No Lane Markings Detected**:  
   - HUD displays a message with grayed-out lane visuals for scenarios when lane markers are unavailable or not detected.  

7. **Lane Keep Assistance (LKA)**:  
   - Active LKA intervention is presented via HUD with speed display and distinct lane visuals.  

8. **Lane Keep Assistance + Warning**:  
   - Warning issued alongside visuals for critical lane deviations.  

9. **Transition to Lane Center**:  
   - Lane correction visuals displayed as the vehicle transitions to the center of the lane.  

This HUD application visually and intuitively corresponds to scenarios configured under LDW and LKA systems.

Type: --  
Status: New.  

Automatic High Beam (AHB) is a driver assistance system that automatically switches from low to high beam when necessary. When the user has activated this feature, it will switch from low beam to high beam when driving in conditions with insufficient lighting. The high beam will be switched to low beam automatically to avoid blinding oncoming or preceding vehicles, as long as these vehicles emit enough light to remain properly visible in the low beam light, or when there is sufficient lighting from the environment (daylight, street lamps, etc.). AHB can be enabled through MHU settings.

  - If nothing is detected in the predicated pathway: Visual feedback is provided.  
  - If an object is detected in the predicated pathway: Both visual and audible feedback are provided.  

*Note: Hysteresis is applied to prevent flashing feedback occurring near threshold speeds.*

The state flows for the PDC system are represented visually. The "Front PDC" diagram illustrates how the system transitions between OFF, Standby, Active, and Malfunction states based on operational speed, gear position, and system fault detection. While in the OFF state, there is no feedback. In Standby mode, feedback remains absent, with the AUTO ON setting either enabled or disabled. In Active mode, visual feedback is provided if nothing is detected in the pathway, and both visual and audible feedback are displayed when an object is detected in the pathway. Malfunction mode indicates system fault detection via IPC notification.

The "Rear PDC" diagram illustrates similar system state transitions. When the gear position is Reverse and operation speed is suitable, the system transitions from OFF to Active. In Active mode, visual feedback is provided when no objects are detected and both visual and audible feedback are activated when an object is detected in the pathway. Malfunction mode indicates system faults via IPC notification. Hysteresis logic is used in both diagrams to prevent flashing feedback when driving around the threshold speed.

Fully Automated Parking Assistance (FAPA) is a driver assistance system that helps the driver to enter and exit parking slots. The driver has to supervise the system under all conditions and must be available to take over the control of the vehicle.  

FAPA will auto-activate when vehicle speed is below 30 km/h. The user would have to tap the auto parking option to begin the FAPA.

MHU shall implement the FAPA visualization for scenarios representing parking and navigation modes.  

Illustrations present the integration of parking guidance and navigation system functionalities with visual cues for active system states, cancel buttons, and safety prompts:

- The overlay demonstrates vehicle positioning during active parking mode.
- Icons identify key system visualization elements such as speed, navigation guidance (Central Park Avenue direction), and multimedia control (currently playing "Don't Start Now" by Dua Lipa).
- Distinct numeric indicators (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 20) display critical inputs from FAPA system flow and safety warnings.

This image depicts the vehicle’s interface during parking actions, presenting both visual guidance and system notifications. The interface is segmented, showing vehicle status, navigation details, and a music application.

1. Vehicle status: The vehicle diagram indicates active assistance with assigned parking positions identified numerically (1 through 5 in pink circles). Elements like steering, vehicle trajectory paths, and system-enabled features are visible.

2. Navigation details: Central navigation displays SE Central Park Ave, with a calculated duration of 13 minutes to the destination.

3. Music application: Dua Lipa's song "Don't Start Now" is currently displayed on the right section of the interface, with accessible media controls beneath.

4. Interactive icons: Numerical indicators in pink highlight actionable zones for parking and maneuver decisions. Details such as system cancelation options and current speed (e.g., 12 Km/h) are also provided.

The illustrations serve as operational visualizations of automated parking actions regarding space calculation and user alerts.

2. **Parking Visualization**: Showcases parking paths, vehicle positions, and identified parking spots using visual markers and color indicators.
3. **Environmental Awareness**: Integrates camera feed from surrounding environments (e.g., street views) to better orient users.
4. **Function Buttons**: Includes controls such as "Start Auto Park," "Cancel," and directional support for navigating parking maneuvers.
5. **Navigation**: Displays routing information, including estimated time (e.g., "13 min"), distance (e.g., "12.5 KM"), and destination (e.g., "SE Central Park Ave").
6. **Media Information**: Concurrently shows audio playback with artist and track name, ensuring seamless infotainment integration during operations.

These visualizations effectively support users in engaging the auto parking feature with added situational awareness and interaction cues.

- **Left Panel**: Visualization of the vehicle's position in relation to adjacent cars and the parking spot. Detected objects and guidelines are marked with a color-coded system to assist with parking maneuvers.
    - **Indicators**:
        - "1" marks the primary detected car.
        - "2" highlights the parking spot.
        - Additional numbers denote detected objects or guidelines around the vehicle.
    - **Cancel Button**: Allows users to interrupt the auto park action.
- **Right Panel**: Real-time external camera view showing the parking spot and surrounding area.
