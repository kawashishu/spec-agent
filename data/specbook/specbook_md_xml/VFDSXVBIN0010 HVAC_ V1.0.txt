## Interior Airflow Quantities
Minimum HVAC airflow quantities, with 12V applied to the blower (bench test) and with charcoal filters plus additional devices (e.g., grid, resistance = TBD) installed in the module, must be tested at any recirculation air mixture ratio.  
The airflow test must also be run at 6V, 8V, 10V, and 14V applied to the blower, providing data and distribution results to the responsible VinFast engineer.  

**Note:** Additional requirements (noise, current draw, etc.) related to system airflow must comply with the maximum operating point allowed in the vehicle. An additional test at 14V applied to the blower must be conducted without inlet or exit restrictions to the HVAC FRT UNIT to ensure compliance with electrical load requirements.
</page>

<page number="14">
Interior Airflow Distribution.

Distribution across the I/P and RR console outlets shall be balanced within a maximum of 5% difference between the lowest to highest outlet airflow. In all modes, the maximum current draw shall not exceed:
- DC 25A at 12V.
- 45% blower ASM efficiency. 
Realistic air ducts and outlets should be applied during the air distribution test.

</page>

<page number="16">
Partial Recirculation Air Controlling. Filtration has to be applied for Outside Air (OSA) and Recirculation. The system has to be equipped with a Particle filter or a combination filter (Particle & Charcoal). For the common filter application, the same filter size shall be applied as embedded attachment.

Filter location must ensure homogeneous air filtration to the entire filter face. Maximum allowed difference in air velocity across the filter surface is 30%.

Air Quality Detection. Vehicles may include electrical sensors and system mechanizations (e.g., automatic recirculation) required to implement market-driven air quality improvements. The HVAC FRT UNIT should fulfill the Air Quality Sensor (AQS) function during the vehicle's lifetime. Operating specifications are included in the 2D drawing.

Stale Air Odor Reduction / Smell. The supplier shall propose solutions to prevent air conditioning (A/C) smell at low service costs (e.g., alternatives to anti-A/C smell detergents). The HVAC FRT UNIT shall be designed to eliminate stale air odor and should be capable of accepting an “After-Blow” module in service. This function is only valid for software development for the Control systems.

The After-Blow Function, defined: The function is used to eliminate the odor associated with A/C usage. It involves the HVAC blower running at high speed for 1 minute, followed by approximately 5 minutes at low speed after the vehicle has been powered off for 30 minutes. This operation physically blows off excess condensation (calibrated regionally). In detail, refer to HVAC CCU Statement of Requirements (SOR), including “After-Blow” function description. If the ignition is turned on during the delay period, the “After-Blow” function output shall be disabled.

Linearity and Air Imbalance.

HVAC FRT UNIT shall be designed in such a way that as the temperature door is moved from full cold to full hot the temperature changes sufficiently but not too much so that the customer can find comfort at different ambient conditions.

In “FOOT Mode,” the useful range should be a minimum of 70%. Useful range is defined as the door travel change in percent, from full hot to 25 °C outlet temperature. In the useful range, for every 10% door travel, the average FOOT outlet temperatures should change at least 4°K and no more than 12°K. Any individual FOOT outlet must change at least 2°K and no more than 15°K.

In “Vent Mode,” the useful range should be a minimum of 50%. Useful range is defined as the door travel change in percent, from full cold to 22°C outlet temperature. In the useful range, for every 10% door travel, the average vent outlet temperatures should change at least 4°K and no more than 12°K. Any individual vent outlet must change at least 2°K and no more than 15°K.

In “Bi-Level Mode,” the useful range should be 35%. Useful range is defined as the difference in door travel percentage when the average FOOT outlet temperature is 20°C to when the vent outlet average is 30°C. In the useful range, for every 10% door travel, the average vent outlet temperatures should change at least 4°K and no more than 12°K. In the useful range, for every 10% door travel, the average FOOT outlet temperatures should change at least 4°K and no more than 12°K. Any individual vent or FOOT outlet must change at least 2°K and no more than 15°K.

In a single outlet, the temperature difference between the warmest and coldest point shall not exceed 2°K; this will require homogeneity in each outlet. Temperature split between outlets shall be evaluated at total airflows between 40 l/s and maximum airflow, to ensure requirements are still fulfilled.

Side-to-side air discharge temperature imbalance shall not exceed 4°K.

The temperature difference between outlets in Bi-Level and Defog mode shall be as detailed in the following figure:

Table 5.3.2: Temperature Differences Between Outlets in Bi-Level and Defog Mode.
- Defrost temperatures shall be 0 to 5 °C cooler than front floor without tolerance.
- Side window DEF (SWD) shall be 0 to 5 °C warmer than front floor without tolerance.
- Tolerance shall be ±3 °C.

Linearity and temperature differences shall also be evaluated at each mode lower blower speeds (e.g., fan voltage TBD) to ensure requirements are still fulfilled. Linearity will be determined in the following modes: VENT, Bi-Level (FOOT+Vent); FOOT, DEF-FOOT (DEF+FOOT); DEF.

Note: Severe unbalances are not allowed in any combination of modes. Temperature hysteresis max. 8% of control travel or for ECC max. 3% of flap travel. Heater rear discharge is measured at the outlet of the module. For all other outlet thermocouple placements, see test procedures.  

Temperature imbalance, left to right, across I/P shall not exceed 4°K for all distribution modes.

Note: System includes the HVAC FRT UNIT and the Climate Control Unit (ECC); left/right temperature imbalance has to be evaluated from the same temperature sensor value.
</page>

<page number="19">
For all distribution modes, when the temperature door is held stationary, the closing of one or more I/P outlets shall not cause more than a 2°K change in temperature of any of the other discharge outlets. The optional electrical auxiliary heater shall not influence the linearity.

### Dual Zones Systems

#### Left/Right Variation
Dual zone systems shall be capable of producing a minimum of 50°C discharge temperature offset from the driver’s zone to the passenger’s zone (right to left variation).

#### Zone-to-Zone Crosstalk
The following requirements shall be met when any single temperature door is moved, with the other temperature door kept stationary. A 4°K change in average A/C discharge air temperature in the moving door zone shall not cause more than a 1°K change to the other stationary zone in the whole temperature control range.

### Linearity and Air Imbalance
HVAC FRT UNIT shall be designed in such a way that as the temperature door moves from full cold to full hot, temperature changes sufficiently but not too much, ensuring customer comfort in varying ambient conditions.

- In **FOOT Mode**, the useful range should be a minimum of 70%. Door travel change in percent from full hot to 25°C outlet temperature must average a 4°K to 12°K change in FOOT outlet temperatures for every 10% door travel.
  
- In **Vent Mode**, the useful range should be a minimum of 50%. Door travel percent from full cold to 22°C outlet temperature must average a 4°K to 12°K change in vent outlet temperatures for every 10% door travel.
  
- In **Bi-Level Mode**, the useful range should be 35%. This reflects the percentage difference in door travel when the average FOOT outlet temperature is 20°C, to when the vent outlet average is 30°C. Each mode's temperature changes must average 4°K to 12°K for every 10% door travel.

Temperature differences between the warmest and coldest points within outlets should not exceed 2°K. Side-to-side air discharge imbalance should not exceed 4°K. Details of specific allowable temperature differences in Bi-Level and Defog mode are shown in the related Figure.

#### Notes:
1. Defrost temperatures shall be 0-5°C cooler than the front floor without tolerance.
2. Side window defrost (SWD) temperatures shall be 0-5°C warmer than the front floor without tolerance. 
3. Tolerance is +/- 3°C. 

### Dual Zones Systems
#### Left/Right Variation
Dual zone systems must enable at least a 50°C temperature difference between driver and passenger zones.

#### Zone-to-Zone Crosstalk
When one temperature door is moved while the other remains stationary, a 4°K change in the moving zone should not change the stationary zone's average air temperature by more than 1°K across the full temperature range.

### Noise and Vibration Requirements
#### Maximum HVAC Module Blower Noise

HVAC blower noise must not exhibit beats, pulsations, or pure tones. Narrowband peaks in the spectrum should not exceed neighboring levels by the limits defined in **Table 5.3.4**, for any condition or mode.

#### Stepper/DC Motor/LIN Actuator Noise
Stepper/DC motors must meet the loudness limits in **Table 5.3.5**, with steady-state noise variations not exceeding 0.5 sones GF during operations. 

#### Rotating Assembly Unbalance
For HVAC blower motors, the rotating assembly's static and dynamic unbalance specifications are outlined in **Table 5.3.6**.

#### Squeak and Rattle Requirements
HVAC subsystems must be squeak and rattle-free. Any discovered issues are the supplier’s responsibility to resolve promptly at no extra cost. Subjective and objective testing involving vibration inputs across operational modes as detailed in **Table 5.3.6-I** and **5.3.6-II** ensures compliance.
