### Durability/Corrosion
Corrosion requirements align with VFDSXXCVC4401. Testing includes:
- Fog tests (ISO6270 CH).
- Salt spray tests (ISO9227).
- Cyclic corrosion tests (ISO11997 Cycle B).

### Safety and Security
Safety requirements include Thatcham standards.

### Thermal and Aero
Thermal and aerodynamic targets must meet PAT benchmarks. Powertrain assessments must account for air intake and thermal compliance.

### EMC
No EMC requirements are specified.

### NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness)
1. Acoustic and vibrational behavior should satisfy complete vehicle targets and ensure overall performance is equivalent or superior to the benchmark.
2. System design must ensure acoustically unobtrusive operation under all work conditions, particularly avoiding rattling, squeaking, tone noise, whine noise, and groaning.
