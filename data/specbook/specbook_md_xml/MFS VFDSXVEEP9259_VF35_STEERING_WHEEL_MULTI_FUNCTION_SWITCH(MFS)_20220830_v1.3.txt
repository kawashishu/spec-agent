This version is legally binding.

This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure. It consists of universal requirements for the “General Project Requirements for Suppliers” (Part 1 - level 1), Common Electric Specifications (applicable documents of Part 1 - level 1), the “System / Component Specification Book for Supplier” for mechanical and mechatronic system / components (Part 2 - level 2), and general “Further Applicable Documents” (Part 3 - level 3).

Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g., what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English.

All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.  
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.

- Shall: The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.
- Should: The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.
- May: The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

2.5 Development and Supply Scope.

2.5.1 Work Interface Chart (RASI).
The Work Interface Chart describes the sequence of deliverables, roles, and responsibilities across different project phases for the Multi Functional Switches (MFS). The chart defines tasks under the Concept Phase, Series Development, and Launch Phase, outlining contributions from VF Engineering, VF Purchasing, Supplier, SQE, and Manufacturing teams.

The main supplier obligations are categorized as follows:
- **Responsible (R):** The person or entity accountable for executing the activity. They may request necessary support from the project team.
- **Approval (A):** The person or entity responsible for releasing or deciding the deliverable. In the absence of a defined decider, the Responsible person assumes this role.
- **Support (S):** The person or entity obligated to actively assist the Responsible individual or team. This includes providing knowledge resources, capacity, or expertise.
- **Informed (I):** The stakeholders informed of ongoing activities and progress without a direct obligation for action.

Responsibilities across phases:
- **Concept Phase:** Begins with creating a list of concepts and preliminary SOR (Statement of Requirement). Tasks include supply chain strategy development, target validation for cost and weight, system integration testing plans, manufacturing feasibility analyses, CAD/3D submissions, and design optimization.
- **Series Development:** Continues with the development of PFMEA, technical convergence for PR levels, and systematic validation plans. Emphasis is laid upon tools order release, engineering change management kick-off, and quality planning measures to meet milestone requirements.
- **Launch Phase:** Concludes with process validation, nominal fit assessments, PV completion, appearance approvals, and engineering sign-offs.

MHU to MFS via XGW:  
- ON Steering wheel Heat Function  
- OFF Steering wheel Heat Function  

**Steering Wheel Heater ON-OFF Logic:**  
The block diagram represents how the logic operates for turning the steering wheel heater function ON and OFF logically.
</page>

<page number="26">
5.3.1.1.2 VF Logic for STWH ON-OFF through MFS R and MHU-logic steps.

1. An ON signal is sent through communication.  
2. MFS-R switches on the internal logic, and the STWH circuit begins operation. The heater starts heating.  
3. An NTC temperature sensor monitors the temperature.  
4. When the maximum temperature threshold is reached, the MFS-R stops the heating process momentarily, allowing the STWH to cool down.  
5. The temperature sensor continues monitoring the temperature.  
6. Once the minimum temperature threshold is reached, the MFS-R switches the STWH back ON.  
7. During operation, the temperature oscillates between the maximum and minimum thresholds.  
8. If the driver turns the STWH OFF through the multifunction screen, MFS-R receives the signal via communication.  
9. MFS-R opens the logic and switches OFF the STWH function, allowing the steering wheel to cool down to ambient temperature.  

*Note:* STWH refers to "Steering Wheel Heater."

### 6.12 Resistance to Media and Chemical Requirements  

#### 6.12.1 Contamination  

#### 6.12.2 Cleaning  

#### 6.12.3 Corrosion Protection  
**Generally:**  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (type Gortex), when in wet locations.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.  

Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners, etc., that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials.  

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  
**Terminals, connectors:** Do not place terminals on the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness: Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  
**Groundings:** Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.  
**Aluminium/sealing surfaces:** Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of >1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces.  

**Reason:** Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.  

**Corrosion tests:**  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test. Before and after corrosion testing, a functional testing is to be carried out.  

- Component test for metallic surfaces: **Salt spray test:** ISO 9227, acceptance criteria defined.  
- For organic coatings: **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT):** ISO 11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria defined.
</page>

<page number="39">
6.12 Resistance to Media and Chemical Requirements.

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

**Test Criteria:**
The test criteria for various areas based on corrosivity levels are as follows:

6.12.4 Tightness and Protection Classes

6.13 Environmental Compatibility

6.13.1 Material Selection  
**Material Information**  
The supplier has to provide detailed information about the specific trade names and quality of the planned materials (e.g., ABS+PC; trade name: ???, supplier: ???) before the milestone procurement release. Material safety data sheets (SDS) according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (incl. national chemical inventory 2017) have to be provided for milestone concept confirmation. Consider local rules for SDS creation and UN-guidelines acc. GHS Globally Harmonized System of Classification, Labelling, and Packaging of Chemicals. Material safety data sheets have to be provided by the supplier to VinFast.  

**Material Compliance**  
The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification have to be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier.  
- The conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured by the supplier through the complete product life cycle.  
- For PPAP material data sheets (MDS) in IMDS according to IMDS Rules and Guidelines IMDS 001 and IMDS Recommendations 002-022 are required. Updates are required for changes.  
- Material data sheets have to be provided by the supplier to VinFast: Project VinFast IMDS-ID @ 192996.  

All materials and components have to meet the latest legal requirements of the UN regulations regarding restricted and prohibited materials and substances for automotive applications. At least all materials and substances used for automotive products have to meet the Global Automotive Declarable Substances List (GADSL). Further information: [https://www.gadsl.org/](https://www.gadsl.org/).  

**Recycled Materials**  
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called "proven recycling technologies").  
Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc...) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance experts team at VinFast.  

6.13.2 End of Life Treatment  
**Dismantling Scheme**  
The dismantling scheme describes the requirements to the contractor in terms of a simple, unmixed dismantling of the component as well as its accessibility when assembled. Dismantling scheme must be provided to the environmental experts team at the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

**Recycling Scheme**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements for the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at the end of life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor must show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling scheme must be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

**Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization**  
To ensure a cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided for, via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:  
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks/check of deployment per component).  
- After deployment of the pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that are classified, according to the status of the respective valid waste legislation, as toxic waste or hazardous substances (otherwise, the components must be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances).  
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle/via the feedback at the deployment tool).  
- Marking of positions of pyrotechnical components (especially "hidden" components, e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest).  
- In case of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is required. Technical pre-dismantling, if possible, shall be avoided (accessibility of fasteners).  

6.13.3 Eco-Design  
**Parts Marking**  
Parts marking should be carried out using the rule "as few characters as possible but as many as necessary." The marking consists of brief type designations, which have been defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for "more than" (>) and "less than" (<).  
6.13.4 Lifecycle Analysis  

6.13.5 Emissions & Toxicology  
**Harmful Substances in Components and Materials**  
The emission behavior of the E/E product with direct contact to the interior compartment must be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment must be minimized accordingly. Required measurements for confirmation of the emission characteristics must be performed by the supplier in agreement with the specialist department of VinFast. Testing institutes approved by VinFast must perform the tests. It is recommended to obtain an overview of all approved testing institutes from VinFast. Additional requirements can be found in project-specific documents (e.g., Emission Guideline).  

Volatile organic compounds of components must be checked according to ISO12219. The conformance to prohibited substances must be ensured throughout the complete product life cycle.  
The specialist department of VinFast evaluates the test results. In any case, the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health must be attested in written form on demand. The supplier must provide measurement results regarding VOC and Fogging for the materials before the milestone purchase release.  

6.14 Mechanical Requirements  

6.14.1 Load  
**Operating Loads**  
Operating loads are the loads that occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VF.  
The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in Chapter 5.18.  

**Special Events**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.

6.14 Mechanical Requirements

6.14.1 Load  
**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads are the loads, which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VF. The definition of customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.

**Special events:**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking. The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.

**Misuse events:**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact. The vehicle must be dimensioned so that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easily replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damage only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or at neighboring components (principle “deformation before break”).

6.14.2 Vibration Behavior  
The eigen frequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 30Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VF. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.

6.14.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

6.14.4 Deformation  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

6.14.5 Pressure  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

6.14.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance  
**S&R, General:**  
Noises, which are perceived by customers as disturbing, have to be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier has to guarantee that their components are free of disturbing noise in their vehicle environment and their geometrical integration. Similarly, at vehicle- and audio system excitation under all environmental conditions and over the fixed component service life.  
There must not be squeak or rattle noises due to excitation of the body (wind load, torsional flexing, etc.) if real relative movements occur on the surface. This has to be guaranteed over the whole operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity). To evidence disturbing noise freedom, the requirements must be coordinated with the testing team responsible.  

The supplier is responsible for supporting the development of vibration and acoustic behavior of the subsystem within the complete vehicle environment and has to ensure constant acoustic quality of delivered parts. This includes the active support of pointing out problems as well as making proposals to solve them actively. Suppliers must deliver necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation as requested free of charge.

6.15 Durability / Life Time  
The lifetime mileage of the complete vehicle shall be at least 160,000 km, and the vehicle lifetime shall be at least 10 years.  
The environmental operating conditions are:  
- -30°C to +50°C ambient.
