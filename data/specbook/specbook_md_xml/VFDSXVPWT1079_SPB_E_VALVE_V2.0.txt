<page number="9">
**5.1.2 Package layout overview:**  
Complete vehicle is still under development. Use dimensions provided as reference to confirm technical feasibility and provide the initial quotation. More accurate dimensions and envelopes will be provided once they are available.  

The system designer has to coordinate all components of the module in relation to: Packaging, Function, Fixing, and tolerances.  

Dimensions will be defined based on BEV layout, but the objective is as compact as possible design while taking into account the overall low cost and acceptable quality. It is the supplier's responsibility to confirm the most cost-effective alternative(s) for each variant.  

**5.1.3 Function:**  
The coolant pump is subjected to:  
- Operating Temperatures ranging from –30°C to +100°C.  
- System pressure: up to 2 bar.

5.1.2 Package Layout Overview.
Complete vehicle development is ongoing. The provided dimensions serve as references for confirming technical feasibility and generating initial quotations. Precise dimensions and packaging information will be shared when available. System designers must coordinate module components concerning packaging, function, fixing, and tolerances.

Dimensions based on BEV layout aim for compact and cost-effective designs. Suppliers are responsible for confirming optimal, cost-effective alternatives for all variants.

5.1.3 Function.
The coolant pump must adhere to the following parameters:
- Operating temperatures: −30°C to +100°C.
- System pressure: Up to 2 bar.

### 5. Description and Scope of Work  

#### 5.1 Technical Requirement  
This specification establishes the technical cooling module requirements for the BEV e-valves.  
It must be ensured at all times that VinFast can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

| Boiling Point (°C)                 | 110.5              |
| Kinetic Viscosity @ 20°C (mm²/sec) | 4.0                |

#### 5.1.5 Interfaces  
The e-valves must operate seamlessly with adjoining systems and interfaces, ensuring compatibility with:  
- Coolant lines  
- Electrical connections  
- E-valve mounting brackets  
- BIW (body-in-white) clearances, packaging, stiffness, and resonances  
- Chassis components (fuel system, braking system, piping)  
- Complete vehicle performance targets  

The system must endure temperature variations (-30°C to +100°C), corrosive environmental conditions, and road-related stresses. Interface design must also consider supportive durability, static/dynamic behavior, and tolerance stack-up.
