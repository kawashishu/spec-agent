### Emissions & Toxicology
#### Odor
- The odor behavior of the interior components has to be checked according to VDA 270. The tests have to be agreed with the specialist department of VinFast. The fulfillment of a target value <3 for odor according to this specification book has to be proved by the supplier via measurements. The supplier has to provide measurement results regarding odor for components before the milestone purchase release.

- In alignment with an expert team at VinFast, an optional test procedure to measure odor behavior of components can be defined according to ISO 12219, part 7.

#### Interior Parts Emissions (Bag Method)
- The emissions of interior components, semi-finished products/auxiliary means, and surface materials (foils, artificial leather, films) have to be checked according to standard ISO 12219, part 2 ("bag method"). The fulfillment of a target value for interior part emissions according to this specification book has to be proved by the supplier via measurements defined by VinFast.

#### Harmful Substances in Components and Materials
- The emission behavior of the product has to be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment have to be minimized accordingly. Required measurements for confirmation of the emission characteristics have to be done by the supplier in agreement with the specialist department of VinFast. The measurements must be done at testing institutes approved by VinFast. It is recommended to obtain an overview of all approved testing institutes from VinFast.

- Additional requirements can be found in project-specific documents (e.g., Emission Guideline). Volatile organic compounds of components have to be checked according to ISO 12219. The conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured through the complete product lifecycle.
</page>

<page number="14">
The test result is evaluated by the specialist department of VinFast. In any case, the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health has to be attested in written form on demand. The supplier has to provide measurement results regarding VOC and Fogging for the materials before the milestone purchase release.

Limits for harmful substances emitted by concerned parts and components of the complete interior compartment are defined in the VIAQ Guideline VFDSXVCVC3401.

Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred in respect of availability on the market. Recycled materials must be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert team at VinFast.

**Recycling scheme:**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  
The recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.
