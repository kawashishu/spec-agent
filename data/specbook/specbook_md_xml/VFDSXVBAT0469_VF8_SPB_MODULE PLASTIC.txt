**Overview:**  
Due to the need for more power and more time running on a single charge, it is necessary to connect more than one battery cell into the battery pack to increase the overall battery pack capacity. This is achieved by connecting several batteries in series or parallel.  

Based on the module design, a number of battery cells are to be connected within a battery cell holder (a module), and several modules are arranged in a battery pack.
