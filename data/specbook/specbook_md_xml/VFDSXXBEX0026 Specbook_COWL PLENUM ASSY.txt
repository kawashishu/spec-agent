**Testing**

**General**  
The B2P SUP provides, in time, a detailed testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart. It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.  

In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible. The supplier must download the VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC.  

Unless otherwise expressly agreed upon, a measurement report for each sample part must be included in the delivery. The component developer must ensure compliance with all relevant legislations for their component.  

It must also be guaranteed that all internal VF requirements specified in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and then committed to VF.  

All relevant target markets’ legal obligations have to be achieved. Additionally, all tests must be documented according to VinFast standards or, alternatively, to B2P SUP standards, if the latter is accepted by VF.  

The B2P SUP is responsible for evaluating and performing the required tests for all development phases, according to the specification. The tests must also follow the required DVP&R template (as an attachment to the offer).  

Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time, or no later than the agreed date, as coordinated with the test department.  

In order to align the form and surface, corresponding samples have to be presented to the approval offices at VF, along with a Cubing Report and an Appearance Approval report. Refer to VF Standard Color Matching/Appearance Approval VFDST00038400.
</page>

<page number="10">
Matching parts must be provided by the B2P SUP free of charge and measured and marked according to VinFast standards. Timing for availability will be provided by the matching department.

**Marking of sample parts**  
- Sample parts should be labeled according to VF Standard VFDST00008700.  
- Prepare measurement reports adhering to VF Standard VFDST00008900.  
- Evaluate parts using the VF Standard VFDST00008300.  
- Apply reference point systems in compliance with VF Standard VFDST00000011.  

**Release by Test Departments**  
The VF test department will provide component releases only after agreed test targets are achieved during vehicle integration tests.

- Positive test reports must be submitted by the B2P SUP for all required tests based on DVP&R. Negative results, deviations, or issues must be addressed with a detailed report, proposed solutions, and assurance of adherence to milestones.
- The "OK" or "NOK" result must be included prominently on the first sheet of submitted test reports.

**Analysis and Test Reports**  
The B2P SUP must:
- Provide measurement reports in electronic format adhering to VF Standard VFDST00008900, aligned with agreed measurement concepts for all prototype parts.  
- Analyze each test sample in detail after individual tests.  
- Ensure results are validated by individual measurements and documented within a test report, to be submitted to the relevant VF department for release.  
- Submit documentation for inspections during both development and series production phases at defined intervals or as required.

**Test Report/Information Requirements**  
Test reports must include:  
- A description and picture of the part along with documentation (e.g., part number, change index, materials, manufacturing processes, additives like grease, and deviations from approved serial processes).  
- Detailed labeling for each part with descriptions.  
- For negative test results, the report must include earlier test references and reasons for retesting.  
- Testing methodology: specifying standards, norms, legal requirements, or approved testing procedures.
</page>

<page number="11">
Documentation of result.

- Short description of the result (pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of result OK/NOK, pictures of the parts in testing position, etc.).
- Comparison with results of the specification book, testing specification, legal requirements, etc.
- Recommendation.
- Description of corrective measures or further approach in case of negative test result.
- Progressional testing status.
- Listing of all tests in a table with the responsible person, part status, comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the B2P SUP must give a new date for re-test with countermeasures to VF for approval, specifying the responsible person and company to perform the test.

The VF test engineer must be informed within two working days in the event of negative test results. They must also be updated in periodic intervals with actual status updates and progress. 

If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts must be attached.

**Archival storage of tested parts:**
Testing parts may only be scrapped if the VinFast test department agrees. On demand, the responsible test engineer must be provided with the complete testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions).

**Virtual testing:**
- Suitable calculation methods must be used, and adequately detailed calculation models must be created by the B2P SUP for securing, verifying, and effectively optimizing the component properties. These include rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, all secured via FEM calculations.
- The tool-dimensioning for injection molding must be optimized using corresponding simulations.
- Upon request, the operative calculation models representing the respective development status must be made available to technical departments of VF for internal calculations and integration work.
- The B2P SUP must provide suitable FEM models to VinFast without extra cost.
- Tests outlined in the B2P SUP evaluation plan must be calculatively documented (e.g., FEM) before tool dimensioning.

**Component testing:**
The required detailed testing will be specified in the DVP. The DVP must be agreed upon by VF, VinFast, and the B2P SUP, and will be binding.
</page>

<page number="12">
Mechanical integration tests.

The following tests will be performed as mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle:
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100).
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800).
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000).
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600).

Essentially, no distortion and no functional disturbance on the entire functional temperature range according to VTS is permitted. In particular, the behavior of materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients must remain stable. The tolerances for flush and gap plans after climatic tests and sunlight simulations must not be exceeded.

If VinFast orders parts for testing on its own, the detailed description of these parts must accompany them.

Parts needed for testing activities at the VinFast test department must be provided by the B2P SUP free of charge.

Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.

Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing). For each step of the process, the Supplier is responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to secure:
- OK Shape.
- OKTG.
- AAR Approval.

The process starts during the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval by LS. Suppliers must include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.

Function Safety, Homologation, and safety regulations.

Safety is a critical issue in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety specifically concerns E/E systems.

Functional Safety Requirements.

The supplier must ensure that the developed or manufactured parts meet the following standards:
- IATF 16949:2016, Quality management system requirements for automotive production.
