### 3.6.2.4 / / LCA Active to ICA Passive LCA
#### 3.6.2.4.1
The system detects lateral control or longitudinal control not active (Refer to ACC/ICA specification).  
#### 3.6.2.4.2
The system detects that the ego vehicle has crossed lane marking and lane change procedure is still in progress for 10 seconds.  
#### 3.6.2.4.3
The system detects that the target lane marking is missing after PONR.  
#### 3.6.2.4.4
The system detects that the separated lane marking is missing during lane change.  
#### 3.6.2.4.5
The system detects that the start lane outer marking is missing before crossing PONR.  
#### 3.6.2.4.6
Note: If HD map also provides environment information for LCA function, the existence of lane markings should depend on the fusion result of sensor information.

#### 3.7.2 / / Lane Change Procedure
##### 3.7.2.1
As soon as driver switches off the turn indicator or switches on the opposite turn indicator after PONR during a lane change procedure, the system shall continue executing lane change.  
##### 3.7.2.2
The system shall position the vehicle to the center of the target lane with a lateral offset of 0.2 meters as soon as lane change is completed.  
##### 3.7.2.3

##### 3.7.2.4
The system shall not trigger a new lane change while the turn indicator is on after a lane change is completed to the target lane or aborted to the ego lane, and the driver needs to re-trigger the turn indicator if they want a new lane change after completion.  
##### 3.7.2.5
If lane change is triggered before the hands-off warning, and during lane change, the hands-off warning starts, the lane change maneuver shall continue.  
##### 3.7.2.6
As soon as an inhibition condition applies to an ongoing lane change maneuver after PONR (refer to 5.2.3), the system shall continue the lane change maneuver.  
##### 3.7.2.7
As soon as the system detects the start lane outer marking is missing after PONR, the HWA system shall continue the ongoing lane change.

<page number="4">
3.7.2.8 / The system shall not trigger lane change after hands-off warning. If the driver requests lane change after hands-off warning, the system shall not allow.

3.7.2.11.2.1 / If the road environment does not meet the conditions described in 6.3.1.1, the system shall be deactivated automatically.
3.7.2.11.2.2 / If the ego lane is separated from the neighboring target lane by non-traversable lane markings, the system shall be inhibited.
3.7.2.11.2.3 / If there is a relevant object associated with any of the LCI relevant zones in the neighboring target lane, the system shall be inhibited.

3.7.2.12 / Point of No Return.
3.7.2.12.1 / As soon as an inhibit condition applies to an ongoing lane change maneuver before PONR, the system shall abort the lane change maneuver and return the vehicle to the host lane.
3.7.2.12.2 / When a lane change is aborted and the vehicle returns to the ego lane, the HWA system shall position the vehicle in the center of the ego lane with a lateral offset of +/- 20 cm.
3.7.2.12.3 / If the driver switches off the turn indicator or switches the indicator to the opposite direction before PONR during a lane change procedure, the system shall abort the ongoing lane change.
3.7.2.12.4 / If the HWA system detects the target lane marking is missing before PONR, the system shall abort the lane change and return the ego vehicle to the ego lane.

Type: --  
Status: New  

Lane Change Assist (LCA) will recognize the surrounding environment in highway situations to assist lane change procedures. LCA should always consider the risk of subject vehicles against potential collisions with vehicles to the side or rear of the subject vehicle. The driver will also be prompted when the lane line conditions are not met. In addition, the driver is responsible for ensuring safety.

3.4.1 / / Function Overview.

Requirement ID: FS-225906.  
Type: --.  
Status: New.  

LCA is available on highways (except for ramps) or highway-like roads (roadways separated by constructional means) in the speed range of 70–150 km/h. LCA shall be able to control the vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions when active and fault-free.  

In addition, LCA shall be able to assist the driver in lane change through the following method:  

- Triggered Lane Change (TLC): LCA shall evaluate the conditions when the driver triggers the turn indicator and shall only start a lane change if all the conditions are fulfilled.

---

**Figure 3.1 LCA Function Diagram:**  
The diagram illustrates the lane change process initiated by the driver using the turn indicator. It highlights the system's ability to maintain lane centering until the indicator is turned off.

---

**Important Note:**  
When using the LCA function, the driver is required to supervise the system consistently, as driver hands-off is not allowed. In driver takeover situations like turning, crossing, merging, vehicles approaching from the side, system fault, or unexpected procedures, the driver remains responsible for all driving tasks.  

LCA functionality is exclusively allowed in highways or highway-like roads. OEMs are responsible for informing drivers through the user manual.  

**Activation Speed Requirements:**  
Minimum activation speed corresponds to the SRR detection range. A speed of 60 kph requires an SRR detection range exceeding 90m. If the detection range is less than 90m, the activation speed must exceed 60 kph.  

**Driver Warnings:**  
- Drivers should avoid activating the function in construction zones. (Not in ODD, driver confirmation needed.)  
- Drivers should avoid activating the function where pedestrians and cyclists are on the road. (Not in ODD, driver confirmation needed.)
