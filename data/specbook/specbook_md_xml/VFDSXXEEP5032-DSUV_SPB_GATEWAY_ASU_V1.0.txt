# 1 General Document Guidelines

## 1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.
This version is legally binding.  
This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard.  

Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other. All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g. level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).

---

## 1.2 Language
This document is written in English.  
All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

2 General Project Guidelines  

### 2.1 Development Scope Abstract  
This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the USB Sockets.  
The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics. The contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements. Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details must be reported immediately.  
The contractor is a ‘Full Service Supplier’, with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.  

### 2.2 Initial Situation and Objective  
The USB Socket is a new development component that controls the charging process of attached USB peripherals. Through the implementation of testing and vehicle performance verification, it meets the performance design requirements of the Socket.

### 2.4 Execution Regulations  
The supplier must ensure that the developed parts meet the specified requirements of VinFast, obtain the type certification of the parts, and submit all necessary documents to support the type certification of the whole vehicle.  
When synchronous development is completed, suppliers need to provide the necessary documentation to prove that their products have met the required regulatory requirements, including but not limited to ISO26262.  

### 2.5 Development and Supply Scope  
The supplier status is "Full Service Supplier", which means that the supplier has complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries. This responsibility includes the following:  
- Define, develop, 3D-design all parts within the system.  
- Create release drawings.  
- Ensure the function of the system.  
- Perform any required simulations or calculations on the system level.  
- Validate the system according to the technical targets and tests stated in this specification.  
- System timing (in terms of project management, development, and industrialization).

2.5.1 Work Interface Chart (RASI).
The work interface chart (RASI) illustrates the agreed work-share and defines the obligations of the supplier as described in this section. The supplier's status as "Built to Print" or "Full Service Supplier" is determined based on the System Technical Specification or Component Technical Specification.

RASI definitions are as follows:
- **R: Responsible** – Responsible for proper execution of the required activities and may request necessary support from other project team members.
- **A: Approval** – Decision-making responsibility for release. If no specific decider is assigned, the person responsible for execution (R) holds the decision authority.
- **S: Support** – Obligation to actively assist and proactively support the person responsible (R), including resource allocation and know-how transfer.
- **I: Information** – Entitled to demand updates and information from the responsible party (R).

Details of deliverables and RASI responsibilities are outlined below:

<page number="12">
### 2.8.3 Type Approval and Certification.
VinFast is responsible for the integration and certification of the vehicle-grade system. Vehicle-level certification projects include urban simulation road tests and enhanced road tests. Suppliers of spare parts/subsystems will be responsible for timely responses to failure reports encountered during the integration and certification processes of the vehicle-level system. All countermeasures to resolve issues addressed in failure reports must be executed by the supplier and approved by PPAP.

The integration and certification of components/subsystems are the responsibility of the component supplier. Suppliers must complete all parts/subsystem tests to ensure compliance. The certification of parts/subsystems can be carried out either directly by the supplier or via a third party after receiving approval from VinFast.

However, in all cases, the supplier is required to complete all specified test requirements. Suppliers must provide the VinFast Product Release Engineer with a comprehensive test certification plan for parts/subsystems and obtain approval. The plan should include details such as the number of specimens, test sequences, locations, and schedules for each test.

### 2.9 Quality and Reliability  
#### 2.9.1 Quality Concepts  
Suppliers must ensure compliance with the quality commitment made to VinFast, guaranteeing less than 100 waste products per 1,000,000 spare parts sent to VinFast (PPM ≤100, CPK ≥1.33).  

#### 2.9.2 Risk Management  
Suppliers must notify the VinFast Product Release Engineer in writing of any potential technical issues, including problems, incidents, updated information, or project changes that could lead to increased costs, delayed project milestones, or late deliveries. Notifications must include a detailed repair plan, risk assessments, and an updated schedule covering the overall project progress.

#### 2.9.3 Validation of the SW Development  
Suppliers are required to regularly report relevant design input factors to VinFast and provide engineering support. Attendance at supplier development meetings and the completion of necessary design validation are mandatory.  

In cases where the specifications do not align with the project requirements, suppliers should collaborate with VinFast to resolve discrepancies. Suppliers must also ensure the availability of competent on-site service personnel to assist VinFast with issues related to supplier parts during vehicle assembly, especially during the start-up phase of production.

### 2.10 Content Amendments  
Suppliers are obligated to notify VinFast Product Release Engineers in writing regarding any technical matters that may affect costs, schedules, or project nodes. Written notifications should include details of repair plans, risk assessments, and overall project schedule updates.

5.5 Control Unit Concept

5.5.1 Hardware  
Use a PowerPC microcontroller from STMicroelectronics.  

5.5.2 Software  
Embed uses a Model-Based Development Process that enables very fast delivery. This relies upon the Simulink Blockset that delivers fast CAN communication and gateway functionality, Input and Output Control, UDS Diagnostics, and a UDS Bootloader. This software architecture runs on all Embed ECUs.

Subsequent DBC versions are planned for the milestone:
- LS: DBC V9.2.6  
- SOP (VN): DBC V9.2.6  
- SOP (ROW): DBC V10.3  

Changes between releases are possible. In this case, new versions are officially distributed by the architecture team.

Cyclic messages must maintain a tolerance of +/- 2% of their cycle time.

5.6.1.6 CAN Network Electrical Failures

If a General Bus Failure occurs, the ECU must log a diagnostic trouble code (DTC). A general fault in communication network hardware requires the following conditions:
- No "BusOff-indication."
- No short circuit to ground or battery.
- No open circuit in CAN_high or CAN_low.
- No TX-messages sent for a defined time (e.g., 1000ms).
