3.9.5 Recycling.

**Recycled materials:**  

When selecting materials, focus must be placed on reducing the variety of materials and ensuring compatibility with proven recycling technologies.  

Secondary raw materials (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fibers, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) must be preferred, considering market availability. Recycled materials must be marked according to parts marking standards outlined in this specification book and reported to VinFast's environmental compliance experts team.  

**Recycling scheme:**  
(Information concludes at this point without further elaboration.)
</page>

<page number="16">
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling schemes must be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### 3.9.6 Evaporative emissions:
Not applicable.

### 3.9.7 Drainage and depollution:
Complete drainage of fluids is required for safe and environmentally friendly end-of-life vehicle treatment. For complete removal of fluid niches and pockets shall be avoided. Drainage schemes, including virtual or physical test protocols with information on the type of drained fluids, amount of drained fluids (in weight-%) and absolute mass of drained fluid in kg, must be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### 3.10 Material Requirements & Corrosion:
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations must be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. Critical material combinations must have proper coatings added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers). Avoid water and dirt accumulation; always provide drainage in the lowest positions.
</page>

<page number="17">
Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements. Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement. Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

### 3.10.1 Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

3.10.1 Corrosion Tests.

Stainless Steel:
- Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion), in most cases an insulating coating is required.
- Test criteria for high visible parts: 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check especially areas with crevices.
- Execute component tests with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

Aluminium Parts:
- Aluminium parts in high visible areas must be painted or anodized.
- Test criteria for Painted Aluminium: in line with test criteria for organic coatings.
- Test criteria for Anodized Aluminium: 480h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.
- Execute component tests with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

Chromed Metal Parts:
- 240h NSS ISO 9227 without base material corrosion.

Chromed Plastic Parts:
- CASS-Test according to DIN EN ISO 9227; duration:
  - 48h for Exterior.
  - 24h for Interior.
- Acceptance criteria: no surface defects.
- Additional test: 240h NSS ISO 9227 without surface defects.

Electric Parts:
- Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as control units, must be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (e.g., Gortex) when in wet locations.
- Material combinations must avoid galvanic corrosion, considering fasteners and attached brackets.
- Avoid direct contact with noble metals like steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive/anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness.
- Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are corrosion resistant and compatible with other materials.
- Electrical components must be installed to prevent vibration-related fretting corrosion.
- Terminals, connectors:
  - Avoid placing terminals at lowest points.
  - Corrosion protection requires electrical connections to be protected from humidity.

<page number="19">
Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight, if placed in a corrosive environment. 

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Reason: Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.

Prevention of stone chipping issues:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone hitting risk, choose part materials and paint which have the same colour, to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts which have edges pointing in the vehicles’ driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them, so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.
