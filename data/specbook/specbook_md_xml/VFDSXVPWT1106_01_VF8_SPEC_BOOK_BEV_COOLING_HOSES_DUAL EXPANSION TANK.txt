VF8 VN Dual Expansion Tank Hoses.

This section displays the VN-specific configuration of dual expansion tank hoses used in VF8 vehicles. The hoses are color-coded to distinguish components and their functions, including green for the main line and other colors denoting connectors.

VF8 ROW Dual Expansion Tank Hoses.

This section highlights the configuration of dual expansion tank hoses for ROW (Rest of the World) VF8 vehicles. The design is tailored to compatibility requirements, maintaining a similar color-coded system for easy identification of components.

### VF8 ROW ECO/PLUS CATL - with Two Expansion Tanks
This diagram illustrates the cooling system configuration for the VF8 ROW Eco/Plus CATL variant, which includes two expansion tanks. Key components such as ACC (air conditioning condenser), LT RAD (low-temperature radiator), HT RAD (high-temperature radiator), battery pack, 3-IN-1 PDU/CDPU, and HVAC systems are interconnected with the coolant flow depicted using green and blue lines. The layout ensures optimal temperature management for vehicle components.

### VF8 VN ECO/PLUS CATL - Phase I with Two Expansion Tanks
This diagram represents the cooling system setup for the VF8 VN Eco/Plus CATL Phase I, featuring two expansion tanks. Similar to the ROW configuration, components such as ACC, LT RAD, HT RAD, battery pack, 3-IN-1 PDU/CDPU, and HVAC systems are shown with their connections via coolant flow using green and blue lines. This system ensures efficient heat distribution and cooling across the vehicle modules.

2 Specification summary.

Technical requirements summary (1).  
Refer to DVP for Targets and acceptance criteria.  

Material:  
EPDM / PA12 / PET / PA66GF30% / SS304 / 51CrV4 / PA66 / PVC / PA66+ PA6.  

Functional/Performance:  
Provide a flexible connection between components (Cooling pack/e-motor/Expansion tank/3-way valves/Pumps/HV battery/CPDU/PDU/WCC/HV Heater/HVAC).  
It must permit the flow of coolant at a high temperature/pressure and must be flexible to absorb movements of Cooling system components without ruptures, transmission of loads, and significant flow restrictions.  

Part quality requirements:  
- No visual bubbles should be observed in the part at 2 bar air pressure in water dip test.  
- Sealing surface should be smooth and free from tool marks.  
- Part performance must meet SOR and DVP requirements.  

Strength:  
Available in DVP report - DVPRXVPWT1106/01.  

Durability/Fatigue:  
Available in DVP report - DVPRXVPWT1106/01.  

Durability/Impact:

EMC:  
NR.  

NVH:  
NR.  

Safety:  
Available in DVP report - DVPRXVPWT1106/01.  

Serviceability:  
Applicable.  

3 Additional Technical or Functional descriptions.  
New cooling hoses need to be developed owing to the reasons below:  
1. Dual expansion tank has 2 inlet ports and 2 outlet spigots, whereas a single expansion tank has only 1 inlet and 1 outlet spigot.  
2. Cooling hose routing must be changed to meet cooling circuit requirements. Current cooling hoses are not compatible with the Dual Expansion Tank.
