Refer to DVP:
VFDSXXBEX1139
VFDSXXBEX1139-DVP_ROOF Trim.xlsx.

3.7.1 Test plan. The test plan specifies which entity performs testing, identifies necessary testing devices, ensures test result controls, and tracks progress. Testing must comply with B2P SUP contracts. The plan must be approved by VF validation and component lead engineers. Testing must be updated weekly or when developments warrant changes. Deviations must be agreed upon between VinFast and B2P SUP. 

If errors occur during testing, retesting is conducted at B2P SUP’s cost.

3.7.2 Test plan example. Test plans must be updated weekly by suppliers.

3.7.3 Testing.
3.7.3.1 General. The B2P SUP provides detailed testing plans aligned with the vehicle timing chart. Worst-case component/system variants must be prioritized. 

Mechanical and electrical tests must be combined effectively to avoid redundant testing. Suppliers must access VinFast test standards through the Supplier Collaboration Portal or TC. Suppliers must ensure delivery of measurement reports for each sample part and compliance with relevant target market regulations.

Testing documentation must meet VinFast or agreed-upon B2P SUP standards. Testing must cover all development phases, conform to DVP&R templates, and meet sample inspection deadlines coordinated with testing departments. Appearance approval and surface validation require samples and reports compliant with VF Standard VFDST00038400. Matching parts must be scheduled and provided free of charge by suppliers.

Marking of sample parts, preparation of measurement reports, part evaluations, and reference point systems must adhere to VF Standards:
- VFDST00008700 (Sample Marking).
- VFDST00008900 (Measurement Reports).
- VFDST00008300 (Parts Evaluation).
- VFDST00000011 (Reference Points).

3.7.3.2 Release by test-departments. VF test departments will release components if test results meet agreed targets. Positive test reports must be submitted by B2P SUP. In case of issues, suppliers must provide problem-solving reports and plans.

3.7.3.3 Analyses and test-reports. Measurement reports (VFDST00008900) must be electronically provided, detailing parts across prototype generations. Test samples must undergo detailed post-test analysis.

VinFast Management System  
VFDSXXBEX1134  

### 3.7 Testing and validation and DVP&R  

**3.7.4 Test-report/-information**  
- A description or picture of the part must be provided in documentation, including part number, change index, materials, production process, additives (e.g., grease), and any deviations from the approved serial process.  
- All parts have to be labeled with a description.  
- The reason for testing must be documented in cases such as negative test results, along with attachments of earlier test reports.  
- Testing must include clear naming of the testing standard, norm, legal requirement, or exact descriptions of the agreed testing procedure.  

**3.7.5 Documentation of result**  
- A short description of the test result must be provided, including pictures, tables, detailed outcomes, photo documentation, comparisons with earlier test reports, evaluations (e.g., OK/NOK results), and photos of parts in the testing position.  
- Results must be compared with the specification book, testing specifications, legal requirements, and any other applicable criteria.  
- Recommendations and corrective measures must be described in case of negative test results.  
- Progressional testing status must be documented.  
- Testing must list all tests in a table, specifying the responsible person, part status, comparisons of target dates with due dates. Negative test results require the supplier to provide a new test date along with countermeasures for VF approval and specify the responsible person and company carrying out the re-test.  

The VF test engineer must be informed within two working days in the event of negative test results. Additionally, periodic updates on the testing status and progress must be provided. Any parts ordered by VinFast for testing must include a detailed description.  

**3.7.6 Archival storage of tested parts**  
Testing parts can only be scrapped if the VinFast test department agrees. Upon a test engineer's request, complete testing documentation (reports, parts, descriptions) must be presented.  

**3.7.7 Virtual testing**  
The B2P SUP must employ suitable calculation methods and adequately detailed calculation models to safeguard, verify, and optimize component properties as defined by technical specifications, testing procedures, and applicable laws/regulations. FEM calculations must particularly cover requirements related to component mechanical properties such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety.
</page>

<page number="12">
3.7 Testing and Validation and DVP&R  
The tool-dimensioning processes for injection molding should be optimized via appropriate simulations. Upon request, operative calculation models representing the current development status must be made available to the VF technical departments for internal calculations and integration work. Additionally, the B2P SUP is required to provide suitable FEM models at no extra cost.

The B2P SUP must perform evaluative documentation (e.g., FEM) for tests according to the evaluation plan prior to defining tool dimensioning.

### 3.7.8 Component Testing  
The required testing specifications will be detailed within the DVP, jointly agreed upon between VF, VinFast, and the B2P SUP. This agreement binds all parties to the scope of testing.

### 3.7.9 Mechanical Integration Tests  
The following mechanical integration tests will be performed within a complete vehicle:  
- Climatic Change Test (VFDST00046100)  
- Sunlight Simulation (VFDST00053800)  
- Mounting/Dismounting (VFDST00009000)  
- Vibration Combined with Temperature (VFDST00062600)  

It is imperative to ensure that no distortion or functional disturbance occurs across the entire functional temperature range as per VTS. Particular care must be taken with materials exhibiting high or varying thermal expansion coefficients to maintain consistent behavior. Flush and gap plan tolerances should not exceed limits following climate tests or sunlight simulations.  

Should VinFast independently procure parts for testing purposes, detailed descriptions of the parts must be attached. Parts required for testing activities at the VinFast test department should be provided free of charge by the B2P SUP.

### 3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for All Visible Parts  
Appearance Approval Reports (AAR) are designated as PPAP deliverables. The AAR process is outlined in VFDST00038401, detailing the quantity of parts and timing requirements.  

For each process step, suppliers are required to submit components to VF Quality Design adhering to agreed timing protocols. Approval at the early PT build phase ensures AAR approval at LS. The supplier must include this activity as part of their development process and ED&D cost allocation.
