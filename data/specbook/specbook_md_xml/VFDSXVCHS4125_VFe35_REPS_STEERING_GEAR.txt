### General Description of the Component (3.2.1)

The steering gear must provide the following basic functions:
- Provide mechanical connection to IMS and knuckle.
- Translate rotation of steering wheel to axial movement of rack.
- Translate input torque to rack force.
- Provide assistance force to reduce steering effort.
- Provide feedback torque to driver.
- Provide signal interface to communicate with other ECUs.

For VFe35, the steering gear will be designed as a belt-drive EPS system. This electric power steering system features a steering-rack and belt drive mechanism for higher performance. An axially parallel electric motor transmits the steering-power assistance directly to the rack through a toothed-belt drive and recirculating-ball mechanism. The system ensures precise steering responsiveness and immediate feedback from the road surface.

The steering angle sensor, or SAS-steering angle sensor, is integrated into the steering gear assembly to measure the steering angle and torque.

**Figure 1:** Isometric view illustrates the VFe35 belt-drive EPS system, showcasing key features like the electric motor and toothed-belt drive mechanisms within the steering gear assembly.

The EPS acts as an actuator for the following ADAS functions:

1. **Lane Keep Assist**: The LKA system detects when the vehicle deviates from a lane and automatically adjusts the steering to restore proper travel inside the lane without additional input from the driver.

2. **Lane Departure Warning**: The lane departure warning function shall notify the driver through steering wheel vibrations when the driver unintentionally drifts towards the line or the edge of the lane.

3. **Lane Centering Control**: LCC is available on highways and highway-like roads (roadways separated by constructional means) in the speed range from 60 km/h to 130 km/h. LCC keeps the ego vehicle in the center of the ego lane while either maintaining the driver-set speed, a current speed limitation, or a predefined distance to a preceding vehicle giving priority to whatever requires the lower speed.

4. **Emergency Lane Keeping**: Emergency lane keeping makes a palpable steering correction in the opposite direction to keep the vehicle on track and thereby avoid the severe consequences of the vehicle departing the road.

5. **Automatic Lane Change Assist**: Auto Lane Changing Assist (ALCA) is a driver assistance system that supports drivers during a lane change to guarantee a safe lane change maneuver. As a partially automated driving system, this feature adjusts the steering wheel to move the vehicle to the adjacent lane after a manual request from the driver.

6. **Highway Pilot**: Highway Pilot automates driving functions such as speed control, lane keeping, and lane exiting and entering. When the driver turns the system on, it’s able to match the vehicle’s speed to traffic flow.

7. **Fully Automated Park Assist**: Automatic park assist helps the driver parallel and perpendicular park their vehicle nearly automatically. The system finds a space and automatically steers the vehicle into the parking space.

8. **Remote Parking**: The system enables automated parking for pulling into and out of selected parking spaces. The driver has the option to remain in the car or get out ahead of time while the vehicle parks itself.

9. **Summon Mode**: Summon Mode (SM) is a driver assistance system allowing the vehicle to automatically move to a location from a parking spot. The user has two different options:
   - The vehicle can automatically leave its parking spot and navigate around objects to reach the user when the user requests this from a distance within a radius of 65m by a remote button on a mobile app.
   - The user can send the vehicle to a location (within 65m from the vehicle) by selecting this location on a map on the mobile app ("Go to target").
