### 3.8 Product Safety

The seating system design is developed following the considerations of IATF 16949 section 4.4.1.2 regarding Product Safety and the related steps using dFMEA, with suitable checks and validation as preventative actions to mitigate each potential failure mode.

The process was initiated in steps starting with a P-diagram and interface matrix to generate a function tree as the index basis for the dFMEA itself:

#### Key Categories:
- **Piece to piece variation:** Material property variation, eg: foam, welding variation, trim tension variation, canning forces (eg: crimp, torque), tolerance stack, and manual assembly variation.  
- **Environmental Factors:** Ambient temperatures, dirt and dust ingress, road load (vibrations), and vehicle crash events.  
- **Neighbouring Subsystems:** Vehicle floor, airbag system, safety belts, instrument panel, steering wheel/steering column, front doors and door trims, B-pillars, carpet and NVH, electrical feed and signal feedback, centre console, sunvisor, and foot pedals.  
- **Customer Usage and Duty Cycle:** Compression from seated occupants, wear from occupant ingress/egress, abuse loads (e.g., kneeling on seats), and occupant movements (e.g., bounce).  
- **Changes Over Time/Mileage:** Foam compression set, elastic to plastic memory in springs, trim stretch, loosening in mechanisms, loosening in crimps, and structural fatigue.

#### System Response (Ideal Functions):
- Protects occupants in passive conditions and in crash events.
- Supports occupant and manages dynamic loads.
- Provides sturdy and comfortable seating.
- Enables ergonomic seating and allows adjustability.
- Facilitates easy manufacturing while meeting vehicle integration targets.
- Enables serviceability, meets styling and regulation targets.

#### Error States:
- Does not position the occupant.
- Does not protect the occupant.
- Fails to manage dynamic loads.
- Causes mechanical failure, structural fatigue, excessive structural deformation, loss of adjustment functions, fails to provide comfort, and mechanical looseness.

#### Control Factors:
- Material selection (FEA validated), weld fixturing, GD&T datums, load path management by design, fastener torques, controlled and distributed deformation, pressing feature profiles, automatic locking mechanism design, and regulations compliance.

<page number="28">
Included in the dFMEA are the following considerations to mitigate potential product safety concerns:

- Cross-check of all historical product recall campaign failure causes (NHTSA and Rapex) from the past 10 years, to ensure inclusion in the FMEA’s potential failures and causes.
- Function group 9 lists every regulatory requirement’s failure-to-comply mode as a line item in the FMEA.
- Failure causes which extend into component sub-supplier’s scope have been cascaded through the Special Characteristic Agreement (SCA) document for tracking and auditing through their respective organization per IATF 16949 Product Safety standards, as committed within Vinfast’s Statement of Requirements at nomination and Purchasing Terms & Conditions agreements.

4 FEATURES, PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERISTICS.

4.1 Sub-systems and Functional Attributes.

4.1.1 Frame Structure.

The second row seat structure consists of two main elements: the cushion chassis and the seat backframe. The two elements are joined via 4X M12 bolts. As an added safety measure, to mitigate risks of bolts loosening during service life, the bolts include a threadlock patch.

The backframe consists of two sidemembers, two crossmembers, a pair of recliners (power), and a recliner driveshaft.

### Materials used for the pressed parts are as per the below chart:  
- **Part:** Sidemembers (x2), **Material grade:** CR330Y590T - DP (VDA 239-100), **Thickness:** 1.6mm, **Manufacturing source:** Vinfast in-house, Vietnam.  
- **Part:** Upper crossmember, **Material grade:** HC420LA (EN 10268), **Thickness:** 1.0mm, **Manufacturing source:** Vinfast in-house, Vietnam.  
- **Part:** Lower crossmember, **Material grade:** HC420LA (EN 10268), **Thickness:** 1.0mm, **Manufacturing source:** Vinfast in-house, Vietnam.  
- **Part:** Recliners & driveshaft, **Material grade:** Composite, **Thickness:** N/A, **Manufacturing source:** Imasen, Japan (via HCMF).  

The backframe assembly is welded together onsite at Vinfast, Vietnam. The Vinfast assembly drawing provides full details of weld interfaces.  

Process control in the production process is required to ensure the recliners welded onto either side of the frame are positionally synchronized and their fully-locked condition (manual versions) is synchronized before the recliner driveshaft is attached.

<page number="30">
The headrests on the second row seats have 2-way (up/down) manual adjustment.

**Critical Characteristics:**
1. Presence of all welds.
2. Pitch and alignment between recliner lower plate weld nuts.
3. Height of headrest tube.
4. Material grades of all parts.

**Significant Characteristics:**
1. Attachment torque of pan attachment bolts.
2. Presence of torsion spring.

The cushion chassis consists of the following components: two cushion risers, two hinge brackets, cushion pan, trim attachment wires, carrier bracket assembly, two hinge springs, front and Isofix tube with Isofix wire, and a pair of latch.

**Materials used for the components within the cushion chassis are as per the below chart:**

4.1.3 Fore/ aft adjustment (track slide)

The power track slides, one inboard assembly/ one outboard assembly, consist of an upper and lower slide rails. The lower rails attach to a lower carrier which provides the tip/ tumble kinematics (refer to section 4.2.X). The upper rails have threaded studs attached to them which provide attachment points for the cushion riser brackets to be assembled to. On the inboard track slides, the rear bracket incorporates the seatbelt buckle anchorage.

Through the center of the assembly runs a threaded rod which is attached front and rear to the lower rail. A gearbox is located on the threaded rod to drive the fore/aft movement between the two track rails. A set of ball bearings are positioned between the two rails to aid smooth articulation.
