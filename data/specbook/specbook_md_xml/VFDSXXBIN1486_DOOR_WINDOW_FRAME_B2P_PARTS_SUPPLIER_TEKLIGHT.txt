### Common Information for Front & Rear Door  

#### Function Requirements:
Most important functions of door trim include:
- Covering of DIW (Door Inner Width) and other systems according to styling requirements, also considering targets for legal/market requirements.  
- Tightness against water, air leakage, and dust.
</page>

<page number="13">
- Noise absorption.
- Absorbing properties in case of side impact.
- Integration of add-on parts.
- Providing full functionality over lifetime.

**Overall function.**  
Primary targets for the development of the ASM door trim are:  
- Avoidance of functional and qualitative problems from known systems. Use of standard parts and common parts where possible and convenient.

### Performance Specification

**NVH and Driving Comfort**  

**General: Complete Vehicle NVH and driving comfort targets**  
The vehicle shall enable an acoustics and vibration comfort which is well balanced with vehicle dynamics and drivability so that long distance driving comfort as well as driving over rough road is neither exhausting nor annoying. This requires the absolute absence of squeak & rattle issues under all load cases (speed, maneuver, temperature, etc.).

---

**Supplier responsibility.**
</page>

<page number="17">
The validation of NVH and driving comfort will be done on a complete vehicle level and comprises real customer operation conditions. Before the validation on the complete vehicle level takes place, the supplier has to ensure readiness of the components respectively the system for durability and general testing. The evidence for the test maturity of the components has to be reported in the DVP&R (Design, Verification and Development Report) at the component level.

System suppliers are requested to perform validation activities as specified in respective technical specifications. All parts that are required for the validation activities are specified by DVP&R and shall meet the required maturity level. VINFAST will define quality criteria and validation methods for alignment with suppliers. In general, it is mandatory for the supplier to support the NVH development process and the complete product cycle as well. The support comprises intensive and active cooperation with the development team and manufacturing regarding root cause investigations. The supplier has to consider and support the achievement of complete vehicle NVH targets (objective and subjective targets) at the component and system level.

All components have to be free of squeak and rattle noises to avoid psychoacoustic annoyance during all operation conditions of the vehicle, including audio acoustic excitation. The robustness of the design has to be assured and reported virtually and in the hardware phase before serial release. The sound of actuation noises must not be audible, representing a high-quality impression integrated into the complete vehicle. The requirements are to be performed in all specified environmental and thermic conditions. During serial manufacturing, a qualified quality assurance process has to be established to ensure the quality level.

The supplier has to provide components for testing and NVH tuning and ensure the participation of specialists during local testing and troubleshooting processes.

### Vehicle Safety

#### Cooperation with VINFAST vehicle safety department:
The supplier is responsible for supporting the integration of vehicle safety functions actively. Lifetime-relevant laws and ratings of selling markets, as well as OEM requirements, must be taken into account.

#### Specific demands:
- **Geometrical targets:**
  - Distance to the seat in side bags deployment relevant area ≥ 65mm.
  - Shape homogeneity with respect to several dummy regions.

- **Additional sub-targets defined by VINFAST include:**
  - Resistance at several trim areas, unless further definition donor vehicle stiffness must be aspired.
  - As a validation base and optimization approach, donor vehicle parts must be tested too.
  - Without claiming to be complete, VINFAST assumes a minimum of 30 tests on donor vehicle door trim and project-specific PT parts conducted two months before the PR release.
</page>

<page number="18">
General demands

Unless further specific definitions will be given, the following points must be considered by the supplier:
- Vehicle safety functions must be maximally prepared on the system level by expertise, CAE, and testing.

- Validated CAE material card generation must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier, including principle tests on systems and components.
- Suppliers must define a test matrix aligned with full vehicle timing demands. Before higher-scaled tests such as sled or vehicle crash tests are conducted, supplier optimization test series must be completed.
- Supplier-specific parts required for testing activities must be provided free of charge to relevant testing facilities. The supplier must account for costs of physical parts and CAE models required for their own purposes.
- Requests from VINFAST's full vehicle crash optimization process, such as material definitions, material thicknesses, additional parts, or optimization work, must be incorporated without incurring extra costs.

General requirements:
- A mandatory 20% safety margin must be applied to each single target value.
- Occupant survival area integrity vs. part behavior and fluids, including parts indirectly or directly contacting passengers, must be ensured.
- Edges must not fall below 3.2mm during or after impact.
- Electrical system integrity during impacts and post-crash functions must be maintained.
- Consideration of relevant tolerances is required.
- Robust target achievement must be ensured.
- Asymmetries must be investigated for each side until the worst case is reliably confirmed by VINFAST.
- No modifiers for any rating are allowed.

VinFast requires conformance to established odor emissions standards.
</page>

<page number="27">
The odor behavior of the interior components must be checked according to VDA 270 [17]. Tests must be agreed with the specialist department of VINFAST. The supplier must prove fulfillment of a target value <3 for odor according to this specification book via measurements. Additionally, measurement results regarding odor for components must be provided by the supplier before the milestone purchase release.

In agreement with experts at VINFAST, an optional test procedure to measure odor behavior of components can be defined according to ISO 12219, part 7 [8].

### Interior Parts Emissions (Bag Method)
The emissions of interior components, semi-finished products, auxiliary means, and surface materials (e.g., foils, artificial leather, films) must be checked in accordance with standard ISO 12219, Part 2 ('bag method') [8]. The supplier must prove fulfillment of target values for interior part emissions based on the measurements defined by VINFAST.

### Harmful Substances in Components and Materials
The emission behavior of products must be checked on representative components as early as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment must be minimized accordingly. Required measurements for emission characteristics must be carried out by approved testing institutes recognized by VINFAST. Suppliers may retrieve a list of these approved institutes from VINFAST. Additional requirements can be found in project-specific documents, e.g., Emission Guidelines.

Volatile organic compounds of components must be checked according to ISO 12219 [8]. The conformance to prohibited substances must be ensured throughout the complete product life cycle. Harmlessness of volatile compounds for human health must be attested in writing on demand. Measurement results for VOC and Fogging must be presented by the supplier before the milestone purchase release.

### Emissions & Toxicology: Limits for Harmful Substances

Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:
To ensure a cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function shall be provided via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:
- Sequential deployment of all components to avoid noise and pressure peaks, ensuring deployment is checked per component.
- After deployment of pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues classified as toxic or hazardous waste shall remain. Otherwise, the components must be dismantled and disposed of separately.
- A successful deployment should be immediately visible acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle or via feedback at the deployment tool.
- Positions of pyrotechnical components, especially hidden components (e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest), must be marked.
- Removal of pyrotechnical components is required in the case of non-deployment. Pre-dismantling should be avoided if technically possible.

Recycling:
Recycled Materials:
When selecting materials, attention must focus on reducing the variety of materials and ensuring compatibility with available recycling procedures (proven recycling technologies). Secondary raw materials such as post-consumer recyclates (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fibers, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics) have to be preferred based on market availability. Recycled materials must be marked according to parts marking standards specified in this book and reported to the environmental compliance expert team at VINFAST.

Recycling Scheme:
This section establishes general project-wide requirements for recycling and repair schemes in component development. Design for recycling is necessary to enable cost-effective recycling at the end of life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor must feature a simple layout for the component's recycling process, detailing preferred recycling partners and cost estimations. The recycling scheme must be submitted to the environmental expert team at VINFAST before the milestone PTO (Production Try-Out).

# Material Requirements & Corrosion

Please refer to the VINFAST Request for Quotation.

## Additional Requirements

- **Aggressive Media / Cleaning Compound**  
  Resistance against aggressive media, e.g., tobacco smoke and cleaning agent is necessary. Blank and painted injection molding components must not be affected by reagents (e.g., Cola, sun cream, etc.), neither in optic nor in function. Conventional cleanser must not cause any optic or functional effects to components.

- **Contamination**  
  The contamination impassiveness has to be ensured in general. The surfaces have to be easy to clean.

## Corrosion Requirements Interior:

Items requiring corrosion resistance include:  
- Screws, bolts on handles, and mirror.  
- Key.  
- Seat belts.  
- Trunk area.  
- Seat structure.  
- Invisible structural parts.  
- Vehicle tooling.  

## Generally:

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.
</page>

<page number="30">
Corrosion tests: The parts have to pass System/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

Component test for Metallic surfaces:
- Fog test according to ISO6270 CH. Acceptance criteria specified below.
- Salt spray test according to ISO9227. Acceptance criteria specified below.

For Organic coatings:
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT) based on ISO11997 Cycle B. Acceptance criteria specified below.
- Alternative tests may be proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test criteria:
| Area                         | Corrosivity         | Metallic coatings               | Organic coatings              | Pass criteria          |
|------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                 | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227              | 96 h → ISO6270 CH              | No red rust           |
| Exterior                     | Medium              | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227              | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust      |
| High & not visible for customer / High & visible | High               | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227         | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | CCT: See below        |

### Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:
- **Rust creep (according to ISO4628-8):**
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.

- **Blistering:**
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).

- **Edge corrosion:** ≤ 10%.  
- **Weld seam corrosion:** ≤ 5%.  
- **Degree of rusting:** ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

The Interior is basically considered a dry area, implying low corrosivity. Exceptions might include the floor area or areas where wetness/abrasion by shoes or spilled liquids could promote corrosion.

If combining different metals, galvanic corrosion should be avoided by coating such parts.
</page>

<page number="31">
Edges, especially painted edges, shall be burr-free to ensure good edge coverage and avoid wear.  

**Seat Structure:**  
Uncoated (blank steel) must be corrosion-free for new parts, particularly in areas with corrosion risk that are visible to customers. Extreme positions of the seat-rests must be considered.  

For other invisible areas, test criteria may be lower, but it must be ensured that no corrosion products appear in visible areas, and the full function over the product's lifetime must be assured.  

**Vehicle Tooling:**  
Usually stored in the trunk and subjected to low corrosivity exposure; if tool surfaces experience wear, the corrosivity may increase to medium levels.

**See Also:**  
Corrosion requirements on Electric components.

### Test Plan  

The test plan outlines the responsible entities, timing of tests, and required testing devices. It also includes the visual state results and progress tracking during testing.  

VINFAST reserves the right to verify test results independently. The SDS must provide the required parts for testing free of charge.  

**Test Procedure Validation:**  
The testing procedures and documentation must receive approval from the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer at VINFAST.  

**Plan Updates:**  
Weekly supplementation and updates are required during the testing phase or if development changes necessitate new data/information.  

**Responsibilities:**  
The SDS is responsible for the complete safeguarding of its components. Testing must be planned in advance to accommodate approval and potential re-testing of negative results within the committed schedule.  

The SDS must ensure delivery of all relevant test protocols and reports to VINFAST for verification. VINFAST may attend any testing conducted at SDS sites or testing centers. Any deviations from approved procedures require prior agreement between VINFAST and SDS.  

**Retesting Protocol:**  
If testing was conducted with incorrect or missing parts or under altered procedures, the testing must be redone at SDS's expense. For negative results caused by SDS's errors, retesting must be replanned, and costs are borne by SDS.

Basically no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range is allowed. In particular, by the use of materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients, the behavior has to be maintained. The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.

These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VINFAST and the SDS, and will be binding. If VINFAST orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

**Geometrical Integration**

**RPS (Reference Position System):**
The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. An RPS concept for the design has to be established with quality assurance in the SE process. The RPS determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen within the RPS-system VFDST00000011 [28] according to the interior and BIW department.

**Tolerance Analyses:**
The following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:  
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermal change tests among all climate terms.
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.

Arrangements are necessary to ensure the required gap dimension of components.  

**Clearance Wiring Harness:**
