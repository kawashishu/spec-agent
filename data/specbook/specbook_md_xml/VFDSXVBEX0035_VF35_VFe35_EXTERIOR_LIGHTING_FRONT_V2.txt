**Emissions & Toxicology**  
This section is declared as not applicable for the current context.
</page>

<page number="17">
Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:  
Not applicable.

Recycling:  

**Recycled Materials**  
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  
Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert team at VinFast.

**Recycling Scheme**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  
The recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

**Evaporative Emissions:**  
Not applicable.

**Drainage and Depollution:**  
Complete drainage of fluids is required for safe and environmentally friendly End-of-Life vehicle treatment. For complete removal of fluid niches and pockets shall be avoided.  
Drainage scheme, including virtual or physical test protocol with information on the type of drained fluids, the amount of drained fluids (in weight-%) and absolute mass of drained fluid in kg, has to be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

**Material Requirements & Corrosion:**  
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation.

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosivity Low**  
Used when the position is *not* affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
</page>

<page number="18">
2. Corrosivity Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, road (deicing) salts.

3. High corrosivity: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. Very high corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers). 

Avoid water and dirt accumulation—always provide drainage in lowest positions. Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body through micro-movement. 

Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.

Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

### Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

#### Component tests for metallic surfaces:
- **Salt spray test:** ISO9227, acceptance criteria provided below.

#### For organic coatings:
- **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria provided below.

Alternative tests may be proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

#### Test criteria:
| Area                                | Corrosivity   | Metallic coatings        | Organic coatings               | Pass criteria             |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area  | Low           | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227    | 96 h → ISO6270 CH             | No red rust              |
| Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, wet area | Medium | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust         |
| High/not visible for customer       | High          | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227    | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | CCT: See below           |
</page>

<page number="19">
Cycle B. High/visible, very high corrosivity areas need to pass 720 hours NSS test according to ISO 9227 and 10 cycles CCT test per ISO 11997 Cycle B criteria, with added stone chipping protection where necessary.

### Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT:
- **Rust creep** (ISO 4628-8):
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheets: d ≤ 1 – 2 mm.
- **Blistering**: Blister size maximum S2 (DIN EN ISO 4628-2).
- **Edge corrosion**: ≤ 10%.
- **Weld seam corrosion**: ≤ 5%.
- **Degree of rusting**: ≤ Ri 1 (ISO 4628-3).

### Stainless Steel:
- Avoid direct contact with other metals to prevent galvanic corrosion; insulating coating typically required.
- Test criteria for high-visible parts: 720 hours NSS ISO 9227 without surface changes. Check crevice areas.
- Component testing in assembled sub-system positions preferred.

### Aluminium Parts:
- Aluminium parts in high-visible areas must be painted or anodized.
- **Painted Aluminium**: See test criteria for organic coatings.
- **Anodized Aluminium**: 480 hours NSS ISO 9227 test without surface changes.
- Component tests should be executed in an installed position on the vehicle.

### Chromed Metal Parts:
- 240 hours NSS ISO 9227 test without base material corrosion.

### Chromed Plastic Parts:
- **CASS Test Duration**:
  - Exterior: 48 hours.
  - Interior: 24 hours.
</page>

<page number="20">
Acceptance criteria: no surface defects. Also: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.

Electric parts:
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness.  
Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials.  
The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  
Terminals, connectors: Do not place terminals on the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness: electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  
Groundings: Connecting surfaces for grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.  
Aluminum/sealing surfaces: Aluminum alloys with copper and iron content of >1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces due to their vulnerability to corrosion. This could lead to seal penetration and expose the interior to moisture.  

Prevention of stone chipping issues:
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:  
- Whenever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.  
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help prevent severe issues.  
- In areas of high stone hitting risk, choose materials and paint that have the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.  
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.  
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.  

Test Plan:
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be completed and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also includes results presented in a good visual state and the progress of testing.  
Controlling of test results must be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results, the SDS must deliver the required parts free of charge.
</page>

<page number="21">
The test procedures and documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly or as needed due to development changes. 

The SDS is responsible for the complete safeguarding of their components. Testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results, adhering to the committed schedule. SDS must ensure VinFast receives all relevant test protocols and reports for verification and grants attendance at any testing at SDS sites or testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures require agreement between VinFast and SDS.

If testing is conducted with incorrect parts, missing components, or an improper testing procedure, the testing must be redone, with costs borne by SDS. In case of negative test results, the retesting must be re-planned and paid by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

12 Appearance Approval Process.

The Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is applicable to suppliers providing components that affect CMF appearance, requiring VinFast Approval prior to PPAP deliverables. This report verifies that the VinFast Design Quality has inspected the final product and confirmed it meets all required appearance specifications for the design. Harmony review is significantly important to ensure the quality or homogeneity of components with adjacent parts.

Design Quality mandates all suppliers to submit non-commercial value sample parts. Suppliers are required to submit both complete assembly parts (known as purchase parts, P-level) and child parts (known as component parts, D-level). The quantity of parts to be submitted should comply with guidelines outlined in VFDST00038401.
