**Clarifications for Defect Categories**:  
1. A under the category of defect indicates a serious or minor defect.  
2. If the part A/B is not indicated under the defect position, it means the defect can occur irrespective of its location.  
3. Part A in defects refers to belt surface defects of current rubber products.  
4. Defects in part B indicate visible surface flaws on non-belt surfaces of pressed rubber products.  
5. For interior decoration, if specific color textures are required, refer to the relevant color palette.

<page number="25">
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

### Spare Parts Support Cycle
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need to ensure life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VinFast end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

### Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VinFast after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes:
- BOM table,
- Parts structure and function description,
- Fault diagnosis,
- Special tools for maintenance,
- Relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearance, parts performance parameters).
