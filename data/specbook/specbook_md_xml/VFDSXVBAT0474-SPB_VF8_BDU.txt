3 Additional Technical or Functional descriptions.

Battery Disconnect Unit (BDU) is used to disconnect the battery from the High Voltage Discharging and the Charging Units.  

The contactors and pyrofuse inside the Battery Disconnect Unit create sparks. Since the unit carries high current, the selected components must be capable of withstanding the intermittent spark generated by the contactors.
