1 General Document Guidelines.

1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.
This version is legally binding. This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard. Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g., what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2, then level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English. All official project documentations must be written in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document:
- **Shall**: The word “shall” be used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.
- **Should**: The word “should” be used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.
- **May**: The word “may” be used to denote options that are left to the implementer.
