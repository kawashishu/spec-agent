Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g. what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g. level 3 vs level 2, then level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English. All official project documentations must be written in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document:

- **Shall:** The word “shall” be used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.
- **Should:** The word “should” be used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.
- **May:** The word “may” be used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

4 System Environment.

### 4.1 Functional System Environment.  
- All applied components, including all types of wires, have to be tested and validated for automotive use. All components must be free of any patent or other blockings from other OEMs, suppliers, etc.  
- Components used in the passenger compartment have to be suitable for an ambient temperature range of -40°C to 100°C for 3000 hours and 105°C for 240 hours.  
- **Storage Temperature:** All components used in the wiring harness should withstand storage temperatures from -40°C to 105°C (to be mentioned in the drawing).  

### 4.2 Physical System Environment/Mechanical Interfaces.  
- The minimum bending radii of the wires must be maintained.  
- There must be sufficient installation space for the cable outlet and the connectors of the component.  
- There must be sufficient installation space for plugging and unplugging the component.  
- The necessity of cable overlength has to be checked.  
- Crash-relevant areas must be considered during the installation of cables. This includes wiring harnesses that protect persons in the event of a crash, such as crash/airbag sensors, belt tensioners, cables for door release, B-cables, and supply cables for safety systems.  
- Fastening clips must be mounted at a maximum distance (approx. 250 mm). In package-critical areas, it may be necessary to increase the number of fastening points.  
- Connectors located in dry areas must be positioned to prevent dripping water or condensation from entering. If this positioning is not possible, sealed connectors must be used.  

### 4.3 System Diagram.  
The system and physical schematic scope are not with Spark Minda.  

### 4.4 Content Amendments.

### 5 Functional and Technical Requirements  

**5.2 Functions**  
The applicable functions pertain to the E/E System Schematic, with details provided in Appendices 1 and 2.  

**5.3 E/E System Schematic**  
See harness drawings in Appendices 1 & 2. (Note: System & Physical Schematic Scope is not with Spark Minda.)  

**5.4 Control Unit Concept**  
No control unit is incorporated into the design of this part.  

**5.5 Electrical Interfaces**  
Electrical interfaces are detailed in harness drawings provided in Appendices 1 & 2.  

**5.6 Specific Characteristics**  
Specific characteristics are included in harness drawings found in Appendices 1 & 2.  

**5.7 Safety Requirements**  
There are no specific safety requirements cascaded to this part.  

**5.8 Alternative and Future Variants**  
Two variants are available (ECO & PLUS) for Front and Rear Seats. More details can be found in the part number table on page 2.  

**5.9 Mechanical Energy Management**  
The harness is clipped and the connectors are secured to the BIW and Seat to absorb mechanical energy.  

**5.10 Installation**  
The harness must include clips that are easily fitted to BIW and Seat Structure Mountings.  

**5.11 Styling and Design**  
The harness finish must meet acceptable visual quality standards.  

**5.12 Ergonomics**  
The harness design must allow for easy assembly onto the Seat Assembly.  

**5.13 Technical Material Requirements**  
The harness must not include materials that are prohibited by industry standards. Cadmium, Lead, Mercury, and Hexavalent Chromium are prohibited under ELV Directive 2000/53/EC.  

**5.14 Resistance to Media and Chemical Requirements**

</page>

<page number="15">
### Mechanical Requirements
The inlet connector shall be able to withstand the forces of the mating connector being inserted and removed.

**Operating Loads:**  
Operating loads are the forces that occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by MSF. The definition of customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.

**Special Events:**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect functionality while ensuring no safety-relevant damages occur, and the intended service life will not be reduced.

**Misuse Events:**  
Misuse events are events not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact. The vehicle must be dimensioned to:  
- Ensure damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- Maintain a defined damage chain after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).  
- Allow cracks or damages only to occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or neighboring components (principle of "deformation before break").
