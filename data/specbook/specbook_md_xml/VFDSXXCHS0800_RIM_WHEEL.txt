* TPMS interface: The design is common usage for both rubber valve and dTPMS.  

**Rubber Valve:** The standard rubber valve component is designed with a diameter of 17 ± 0.5 mm. The interface ensures compatibility with the specific TPMS setup while maintaining a secure, damage-free edge.  

**dTPMS:** The direct TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) includes detailed measurements that align perfectly with the valve assembly for optimized monitoring capability.  

**TPMS Sensor Drawing:**  
- The sensor includes precise measurements for alignment and installation requirements.  
- Key dimensions:
  - Length: 53.8 ± 0.5 mm.
  - Base diameter: 16.5 ± 0.5 mm.
  - Detailed connection points for compatibility with vehicle systems.
- The TPMS sensor integrates with both rubber and direct TPMS setups. The drawing specifies accurate designs to prevent burrs and ensures functional use across diverse applications.
</page>

<page number="10">
* TPMS interface: The design is common usage for both rubber valve and dTPMS.

Rubber valve and dTPMS drawing illustrates the compatibility of both designs. The dimensions associated with both interfaces are properly outlined to ensure no harmful burrs. 

* Rim wheel hub interface:  
The design for the hub must conform to the existing plastic hub used by VinFast. Specifications for the interfacing dimensions are detailed to ensure proper alignment with the plastic hub.

Rubber valve drawing:  
The provided technical drawing outlines the specifications for the TR413 Alligator rubber valve, including material and dimensional details necessary for compliance with VinFast's existing wheel designs.

<page number="11">
* Brake Caliper clearance requirement:
Suppliers are responsible for designing tooling based on VinFast styling design while adhering to brake caliper clearance considerations as illustrated. 

The minimum clearance between the brake caliper envelope and the rim is required to be 5mm.

* Kerb clearance requirement:  
To avoid rim curb scratches, at least 5mm clearance from the style face to the outside of the design tyre (ETRTO standard) is required in the range of 150mm kerb height.

* Diagram Description:  
- The clearance of 5mm ensures protection against kerb scratches for tyre designs complying with ETRTO standards.  
- The specified clearance applies between the style surface and the outer tyre wall within a kerb height range.

* Rim profile, backside detail design:  
- Suppliers need to check whether the rim contour profile (J) complies with ETRTO standards.  
- The final design must include details such as wall thickness, reinforcement, and marking.  
- Rim offset specification provided by VinFast must remain unchanged.  

* Notes on Styling:  
- Exterior styling is provided by VinFast and cannot be modified.  
- Suppliers are required to maintain VinFast-provided styling parameters while independently developing detailed rim designs (wall thickness, etc.).

* Balance weight position:  
The balance weight size is defined as 15.5 x 6.2 mm.

* Fixation plastic part with aluminum part:  
- **Type:**  
  - Snap fit: Requirements include avoiding loosening or deflection after long operation.  
  - Screw: 1–2 pieces per spoke. Requirements specify no space for any screwdriver to access the inside of the rim. To change spare parts, the screw can only be unscrewed from the back side of the rim. Purpose is to protect from theft.

* Rim marking:  
Rims must be marked as per the requirements of the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) contained in S4.4.2, as outlined below:  
- The information must be in lettering not less than 3 millimeters in height and either impressed to a depth or embossed to a height of not less than 0.125 millimeters.  
- The information (S4.4.2 a–c) must appear on the outward side of the rim's single-piece construction. In the case of multi-piece rims, the information (S4.4.2 a–e) must appear on the rim base, with items (b) and (d) also appearing on each other part of the rim.  

(a) A designation that indicates the source of the rim's published nominal dimensions:  
1. "T" indicates The Tire and Rim Association.  
2. "E" indicates The European Tyre and Rim Technical Organization.  
3. "J" indicates Japan Automobile Tire Manufacturers Association, Inc.

### Rim Uniformity Marking:

Rims must be marked in accordance with VF wheel and tyre assembly procedure VFDST00080700 (V5):  
"Matching is the unidirectional orientation of a direction indicated by a 12mm red dot for the minimum of the 1st harmonic of the radial force fluctuations of the tire. The rim is similarly identified maximum of the 1st harmonic of the concentricity by a 12mm Blue dot."  

The blue dot has to be placed to design surface for detection in automated tyre assembly.
