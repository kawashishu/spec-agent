5 Description and scope of work

### 5.1 Technical requirement

#### 5.1.1 Purpose/Component Requirement  
The purpose of an Encapsulation is to reduce the EDS emitted noise level (see NVH requirements). The EDS Encapsulation has to cover the E-Motor, Gearbox, and part of surrounded components according to provided design data and package requirements from VF. Design and acoustic functionalities have to be ensured by the supplier. The encapsulation has to effect a subjective noticeable interior-noise reduction.

#### 5.1.2 NVH Requirement  
The Encapsulation has to ensure maximum possible sound-damping:  
- **Overall Target:** EDS Without encapsulation 81dB (A), With encapsulation 76dB (A)  
- **Order Target:** EDS Without encapsulation 70dB (A), With encapsulation 65dB (A)  

**Realisation by:**  
- Increased wall thickness  
- Damping material on the inside  
- Avoid free resonating surfaces  
- Plastic ribbing  
- Avoid acoustical bridges  

Acoustical analyses and calculations have to be done by the supplier. Improvements have to be implemented by the supplier. Content: airborne noise needs to be checked on a sound test bench at various measurement points during trailing throttle, turndown, full-load EDS operation over all revolution speeds. The component must not emit any noticeable squeaking or rattling noises in any driving condition.

#### 5.1.3 Other Requirement  

| No | Parameter                             | Requirements                          |

5.1.5.1 Constructed space.
The available construction space is defined by provided CAD design data from VF. Continuously updated data must be considered, and the supplier is required to inform VF immediately about any needed space exceedance. Deviations can only proceed with VF's confirmation. Suppliers are responsible for time delays and costs resulting from missing information, incorrect data, or unreadable CAD designs.

5.1.5.2 Geometrical interface/connections.
The preliminary mounting concept is defined by the provided CAD data, and any changes or deviations must be confirmed by VF. Surrounding components, such as the oil filler cap, must be masked soundproofed.

5.1.5.3 Design effort.
The supplier will receive the latest 3D data status outlining the current package situation. The requested design work includes:
- Designing a draft and submitting it to VF.
- Providing completed 3D/2D data for release.
