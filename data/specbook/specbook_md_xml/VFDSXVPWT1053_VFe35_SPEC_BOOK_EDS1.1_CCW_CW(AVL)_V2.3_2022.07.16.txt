# 5.1.1.4 Safety and warning notes for towing cars  

Driving of the electric drive system (EDS) is not permissible in case of non-functional LV and/or HV system, or in case the cooling system is switched off. This is due to the induced voltage leading to short-circuit currents after activation of the emergency-ASC and resulting power dissipation, which can cause thermal damage to the power electronics or electric motor.  

This document outlines two options for towing cars:  
- **Option-A:** Using a flatbed truck is recommended for transporting cars.  
- **Option-B:** Towing cars using wheel lifts or dollies is permissible but requires compliance with the manufacturer's speed rate for dollies.  

**Conditions for towing with Option-B using wheel lift (tires can spin):**  
1. HV is not switched off.  
2. LV power supply is still connected.  
3. Cooling system is operational.  
4. Towing speed does not exceed 50 km/h.  

**Important Notes:**  
- If LV power supply is unavailable or powered down, **Option-A** must be used.  
- For AWD variants, towing with Option-B using a wheel lift requires setting the Gearshifter to "N" position to release the Park Lock of EDS to the "Unlock" state.

### 5.1.5 Detailed EDS Functions

#### 5.1.5.1 Operating Mode
In principle, there are two operation models of the product:

1. **E-Motor drive**:  
   In the first operational mode, the electrical power flows from the HV-networks to the U/V/W outputs (E-Motor). The INV converts the HV-network DC power into a 3-phase AC power that runs the E-Motor. The behavior of the E-Motor, such as torque, speed, and rotation direction, can be controlled by the frequency, amplitude, and phase order of 3-phase AC currents.

2. **Recuperation**:  
   In the second operation mode, the power flows in the opposite direction, i.e., from the E-Motor outputs U/V/W to the HV-network. The 3-phase AC power produced by the E-Motor in generator mode is transformed into DC power and then stored into the HV battery pack (recuperation/regeneration). In this way, the kinetic energy of the vehicle during braking can be saved to improve vehicle efficiency.

The EDS operates in all four quadrants (4Q) of the torque/speed-field of the E-Motor as shown in **Figure 5-11**.

#### **Figure 5-11**: Four-quadrant operation of the EDS
The figure illustrates the four-quadrant operation of the EDS:
- **Quadrant 1**: Energy flow from the battery to the E-Motor (forward EM drive).
- **Quadrant 2**: Energy flow from the E-Motor to the battery (forward recuperation).
- **Quadrant 3**: Energy flow from the battery to the E-Motor (reverse EM drive).
- **Quadrant 4**: Energy flow from the E-Motor to the battery (reverse recuperation).

#### Operational Control
The operation modes are controlled by the VCU over the CAN bus and will be further described below. The complete switch-on and switch-off procedures are necessary for safe activation of the main operating modes of the EDS.

#### Preconditions for Activation
Before activating the main operating modes, the following conditions must be met:

### 5.1.5.2 Software State Management

The EDS software includes nine states, which are managed strictly by the logic shown in **Figure 5-12: EDS state machine**. These states represent the system's various operating modes, ranging from initialization to power-off sequences. Details of each state are described in **Table 5-4: Description of state signals**.

#### State Transitions
1. **Initial State:**  
   The system transitions into the Initial state when either KL15 ON or the CAN Wake signal is received. Failure occurs if the initialization timer exceeds the allowed timeout or certain failure grades are reached.
   
2. **StandBy State:**  
   The transition to StandBy occurs if the initial process is complete without failures, and the system is in a non-failure state. It requires a voltage measurement below a predefined threshold ratio.
   
3. **Precharge State:**  
   The system enters Precharge upon successful StandBy operation, provided the bus voltage exceeds the calibration ratio for precharge initiation.

4. **HVReady State:**  
   Transitioning to HVReady requires a successful precharge process, where the voltage level satisfies the calibration ratio for HVReady. This state signifies readiness for normal operation.

5. **Normal State:**  
   The Normal state is achieved upon successful HVReady operation. Under this mode, the system fully engages in its designated tasks.

6. **Discharge/ShutDown State:**  
   The system transitions here if a shutdown request is received or the active discharge finishes successfully. Voltage conditions must also meet thresholds.

7. **AfterRun State:**  
   AfterRun occurs post-shutdown when the data-saving process is complete. It signifies the transition toward powering the system off.

8. **Power Off State:**  
   The complete disconnection and powering down of the system occur after all actions in AfterRun are completed.

9. **Failure State:**  
   The system enters the Failure state if critical faults occur, such as exceeding predefined thresholds for failure grades, or failure conditions persist during other states.

**Figure 5-12** visually represents these states and their transitions based on various system parameters and signal interactions.

#### Pre-Conditions for Main Operating Modes
To enable the main operating modes of the EDS, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
- The DC Link capacitor must be charged to the HV-battery voltage level.
- KL15 (or T15) and KL30 (or T30) must have sufficient voltage applied.
- CAN communication must be completely initialized.

#### Signal List (Reference: Table 5-4)
**Table 5-4** provides a detailed description of the input and output signals for each state, including minimum and maximum values. These signals define the logic, thresholds, and conditions governing state changes.

### State Description

- **Initial state:**  
  The MCU wakes up via KL15 or CAN wake-up signals and enters the initial state. This state involves RAM check, EEPROM check, and ADC collection value check. The self-check time is generally within 300ms (calibration). If self-check fails within this time, the MCU must send a self-check fault to VCU. If the self-check passes, the MCU enters standby mode and sends `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Init` to CAN.

- **Standby state:**  
  Upon completing the self-check, the MCU transitions to Standby state and sends `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Standby` to CAN. In Standby mode, the MCU determines whether to move to the Precharge state or HVReady state:  
  - If the DC-Link Capacitor voltage is high enough (`BMS_Sys_STS = Successful High Voltage Power Up` & DC-Link voltage > `cal_ratio_HvReady_in * BMS_HVPackVol_MEAS`), the MCU enters HVReady state.  
  - Otherwise, the MCU enters the Precharge state.

- **Precharge state:**  
  In this state, the DC-Link capacitor charges in a controlled manner to prevent product damage before connecting directly to HV-voltage. The MCU sends `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Precharge` to CAN.

- **HVReady state:**  
  Once the DC-Link capacitor is charged, the system is ready for operation. The MCU sends `EDS_Work_STS_FR = HVReady` to CAN.  
  If the VCU sends `VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = normal`, the MCU should move into the Normal state. Alternatively, if `VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = HVReady` is sent, the MCU remains in HVReady state.

- **Normal state:**  
  In the Normal state, the MCU manages motor output torque based on torque demands from the VCU. The MCU sends `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Normal` to CAN.  
  If requested, the MCU can change its state via the `VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = HVReady` command.

- **Discharge/Shutdown:**  
  Upon receiving a shutdown command (`VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = Shutdown`) from the VCU, the MCU transitions to Shutdown state. The MCU performs DC-Link capacitor discharge and sends `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Shutdown` to CAN. Depending on KL15 signal and VCU commands, the MCU either enters AfterRun or Standby state.

- **Failure:**  
  The MCU enters Failure state when an error is detected that impacts EDS functionality or availability (`EDS_FailGrade_ERR_FWD`). In this state, the MCU sends `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Failure` to CAN. State transitions are restricted except under predefined conditions.

- **AfterRun:**  
  In this state, the MCU saves data to EEPROM. If no wake-up signals are received, the MCU proceeds to Power-Off state. The MCU can return to operational modes if KL15 is powered again or VCU commands are received.

### **Power-Off State Description and Requirements**  

During the Power-Off state:  
- EDS shall not consume any low voltage (LV) power.  
- EDS shall not communicate on CAN.  
- The IGBTs are open and the capacitance is discharged.  

To enter this state, the following conditions must be met:  
1. The KL15 signal is invalid.  
2. No CAN wake-up signal.  
3. The data is saved.  

---

### **Activation and Deactivation Description**  

The DC-link capacitor is necessary for the correct functioning of the inverter.  
- **Activation**: Prevents uncontrolled overshooting during the initial charging.  
- **Deactivation**: Ensures safe shutdown by controlled discharge of the capacitor.

**Precautions**:  
1. Avoid hazardous quantities of energy remaining in the DC-link capacitor during shutdown.  
2. Prevent hardware damage by controlling the switch-on and switch-off processes (including discharges).  

Controlled activation and deactivation ensure:  
- Prevent overvoltage risks.  
- Avoid peak current damage to the inverter.

### State Description

- **Initial State:**  
  When the MCU is awakened by KL15 or CAN wake-up signals, it first enters the initial state. This includes checks for RAM, EEPROM, ADC collection values, etc. The self-check duration is generally within 300ms (calibration). If the check fails, MCU sends a self-check fault to the VCU. If it passes, MCU transitions to the standby state.  
  In this state, MCU sends the signal `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Init` to CAN.  

- **Standby State:**  
  After completing self-check, MCU enters the standby state, sending the signal `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Standby` to CAN.  
  The standby state determines whether the MCU should enter the HVReady state or the precharge state:
  - **HVReady Condition:** If DC-Link voltage > `cal_ratio_HvReady_in * BMS_HVPackVol_MEAS` and `BMS_Sys_STS = Successful High Voltage Power Up`.
  - **Precharge Condition:** If the voltage is insufficient, MCU moves to the precharge state.

- **Precharge State:**  
  In the precharge state, the DC-Link capacitor is charged in a controlled manner to prevent damage from HV-voltage. MCU sends the signal `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Precharge` to CAN.

- **HVReady State:**  
  Once the DC-Link capacitor is charged, it becomes ready for operation (`HVReady state`). MCU sends the signal `EDS_Work_STS_FR = HVReady` to CAN.  
  - If `VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = normal`, MCU transitions to the normal state.  
  - If `VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = HVReady`, MCU remains in the HVReady state.

- **Normal State:**  
  In the normal state, MCU controls motor output torque based on torque demand from VCU. MCU sends the signal `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Normal` to CAN.  
  - VCU may request MCU to return to HVReady state using `VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = HVReady`.

- **Discharge/Shutdown State:**  
  Upon receiving VCU shutdown command (`VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = Shutdown`), MCU enters shutdown state, discharges DC-Link capacitor, and sends `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Shutdown` to CAN.  
  Subsequent transition depends on KL15 signal and VCU commands:  
  - **Standby State:** If KL15 is on.  
  - **AfterRun State:** If KL15 is off, MCU saves essential data.

- **Failure State:**  
  MCU enters failure state upon detecting errors that limit EDS functionality (e.g., `EDS_FailGrade_ERR_FWD`). MCU sends `EDS_Work_STS_FR = Failure` to CAN.  
  - State jumps only occur under specific conditions as indicated in Figure 5-12.

- **AfterRun State:**  
  In AfterRun state, MCU saves data to EEPROM. If no wake-up signal exists, MCU transitions to power-off state.  
  - Alternatively, MCU returns to operation if KL15 powers up or receives VCU command `VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = Standby`.

- **Power-Off State:**  
  In this state, EDS consumes no LV power, communicates no CAN signals, and discharges IGBT capacitance. To enter this state:
  - KL15 signal is invalid.  
  - No CAN wake-up signal is present.  
  - Data is saved.

### Activation and Deactivation 

The DC-Link capacitor is critical for correct inverter function. Controlled activation (switch-on) and deactivation (switch-off, including discharge) are essential to prevent hardware damage. Risks include:
- Dangerous residual energy due to improper shutdown.  
- Uncontrolled overshooting during HV-battery connection causing peak currents or overvoltage.

Activation: The Electric Drive System (EDS) shall activate when an activation function is triggered (KL15 ON or CAN Wake-up signal). It will cooperate with the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) and Battery Management System (BMS) to successfully charge the built-in DC-Link capacitor inside the EDS, preparing it for normal operation on the high-voltage (HV) system. (Refer to subsection 5.1.5.4 – Charging the DC-Link Capacitor.)

Deactivation: The EDS shall deactivate when a deactivation function is triggered (VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = 11). During this process, the EDS will reduce motor torque and DC current to minimal values (target: 0A), allowing system deactivation with minimal main-contactor current. The EDS must ensure the voltage of the HV system drops below a specified threshold within two seconds upon request during the active discharge process. Shut down will not be executed.

Figure 5-14 illustrates the time sequence for activation and deactivation functions.

### Notes:
- During deactivation of the inverter by switching KL15 (or T15) off, the EDS will not shut down immediately but switch into AfterRun state (refer to Figure 5-). Diagnostic information and driving cycle data are saved in non-volatile memory (e.g., EEPROM or FLASH) to ensure information retention beyond one driving cycle. Permanent supply of T30 input is necessary to sustain this state. The AfterRun state continues until the vehicle achieves a stationary position and the traction driveline is unloaded.

- The VCU holds responsibility for ensuring proper compliance during the HV system's switch-on and switch-off processes.

- When the EDS transitions into the Shutdown state, the Motor Control Unit (MCU) oversees the safety procedure for discharging the DC-Link capacitor (refer to subsection 5.1.5.5 – Discharging the DC-Link Capacitor).

### Activation/Deactivation Processes and Time Sequence

#### Activation
The EDS activates when the activation function is triggered (e.g., KL15 ON or a CAN Wake-up signal). It ensures cooperation between the VCU and BMS for successful charging of the internal DC-Link capacitor, preparing it for HV system normal operation.

#### Deactivation
Deactivation is initiated when the deactivation function is triggered (VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = 11). It involves reducing motor torque and DC current to minimal levels (target: 0A) to safely deactivate the system, maintaining safety by controlling the HV system voltage to fall below a specified threshold within 2 seconds (active discharge). The system does not immediately shut down but transitions to the “AfterRun” state under certain conditions.

- The Activation/Deactivation time sequence is depicted in **Figure 5-14**. 
- Key transitions include precharge, normal operation, shutdown, and discharge states.

---

### Key Notes on Deactivation
- **AfterRun State**: Following inverter deactivation (such as KL15 OFF), the EDS temporarily enters this state to store diagnostic and cycle data in non-volatile memory (EEPROM or FLASH). Proper vehicle conditions, including stationary state and unloaded driveline, are required before transition to complete shutdown.
- **VCU Responsibility**: The VCU manages the HV system’s proper switch-on and switch-off sequences.
- **Safety Compliance**: During Shutdown state, the MCU controls the DC-Link capacitor discharge to ensure system safety.

---

### Activation/Deactivation Time Sequence Diagram Details (Figure 5-14)
1. **KL15 ON**: The process begins with the signal turn ON.
2. **State Changes**:
   - Standby transitions to Precharge.
   - Precharge transitions to HVReady.
   - HVReady transitions to Normal operation.
3. **Deactivation Process**:
   - Normal transitions to Shutdown.
   - Shutdown concludes with the system entering the Discharge state.
4. **Battery Contractor States**:
   - Open state transitions to Precharge, then to Closed during Normal operation.
   - Reverse transition occurs during Deactivation.

### Charging the DC-Link Capacitor
This section outlines the controlled charging of the DC-Link capacitor to protect the system from damage caused by abrupt high-voltage connections. This critical step ensures safe and efficient operation of the EDS under all activation processes.

### VinFast Management System

### Activation and Deactivation Functions for EDS

#### Activation:
The EDS shall activate when the activation function is triggered by either KL15 ON or a CAN Wake-up signal. It collaborates with VCU and BMS to successfully charge the built-in DC-Link capacitor inside the EDS, preparing itself for normal high-voltage system operation. Refer to subsection 5.1.5.4 for more details on charging the DC-Link capacitor.

#### Deactivation:
The deactivation function is triggered by `VCU_EDS_StsModeReq = 11`. In this case:
- The EDS reduces motor torque and DC current to a minimum value (target: 0A) to allow safe deactivation at minimum contactor current.
- The voltage in the HV system will be brought below a defined threshold within 2 seconds upon the request using active discharge functionality.
- No immediate shutdown is executed.

A time sequence outlining activation and deactivation processes is visualized in **Figure 5-14**.

---

### Time Sequence for Activation/Deactivation

#### Activation:
- `t0`: KL15 signal turns ON, the system enters a precharge stage.
- `t1` to `t2`: Battery contractors are precharged.
- `t3`: System enters HVReady mode.

#### Operation:
- `t4` to `t6`: System functions enter normal operation.

#### Deactivation:
- `t7` to `t8`: System begins shut down.
- `t9`: Active discharge phase is initiated, bringing system voltage below 60V.
- `t10`: Complete shutdown is achieved.

Refer to **Figure 5-14** for detailed visualization of activation/deactivation timing.

---

### Charging the DC-Link Capacitor

#### Process Overview:
The DC-Link capacitor within the EDS system must charge in a controlled manner. This ensures hardware protection during system activation or shutdown.

#### Steps: 
- **Condition Check 1:** Transition to precharge (`EDS_Work_STS_FR = 3`) occurs when `EDS_bus_Volt_FWD < 0.9 * BMS_HVPackVol_MEAS`.
- **Condition Check 2:** Transition to HVReady (`EDS_Work_STS_FR = 5`) occurs if `BMS_Sys_STS = Successful High Voltage Power Up` and `EDS_bus_Volt_FWD > 0.9 * BMS_HVPackVol_MEAS`.

Refer to **Figure 5-15** for a diagram illustrating these stages.

### **Function Description**  

#### Activation of the HV-Battery  
The built-in DC-link capacitor in the inverter has a very small internal resistance (micro-Ohm range). To prevent extreme peak currents in the HV-battery while closing the HV main contactors, activation of the HV-battery at the terminals (T+) and (T-) must occur through an appropriate pre-charge circuit (not part of the EDS, but rather in the HV-battery).  

1. **Control Mechanism:**  
   The BMS or other devices act as a controller for the pre-charge circuit.  

2. **Voltage Gradient Limitation:**  
   - Maximum voltage gradient at the terminal connections (dVdc/dt) shall be limited to 5.2 kV/μs.  

3. **Protection Requirement:**  
   - The pre-charge resistor, pre-charging electronics in the HV-battery, or other controlling devices are essential to protect the EDS from damage during activation of HV-voltage.  

---

### **Notes:**  
- BMS or other devices must manage the pre-charge circuit effectively to ensure boundary conditions for the HV-battery activation.

#### Signal List: Discharging the DC-Link Capacitor Function

**Table 5-7. Signal list of Discharging the DC-Link Capacitor Function**  

- **Name:** EDS_bus_Volt_FWD  
  **Description:** Bus voltage of current EDS  
  **Input/Output:** Output  
  **Min:** 0V  
  **Max:** 1000V  
  **Value Description:**  
  - 11: "shut down"  
  - 5: "HVReady"  
  - 4: "normal"  
  - 3: "precharge"  
  - 2: "standby"  
  - 1: "init"  
  - 0: "default"

#### Function Description

The EDS shall provide independent functions and procedures for discharging the DC-link capacitor to voltages smaller than 60 Vdc within a specified time. The discharging functions consist of active and passive discharge as follows:

- **Active discharge:** Implemented through the inverter and motor windings to reduce the DC-Voltage below 60 Vdc in less than 2 seconds (start after the HV discharge information is received).  
- **Passive discharge:** Implemented through a resistance network to drop the DC-link voltage to 60 Vdc within 120 seconds (effective start after interruption of the HV power source, even if not triggered by vehicle superior system).

Note that the HV-battery contactors must be open before the activation of discharge mode and other system components must not supply any energy into the HV network. The VCU is responsible for opening the battery contactors in time.

---

#### Active Short Circuit

**Section 5.1.5.6**

Both hardware and software safety functions shall protect the EDS. One of such functions is the **Active Short Circuit (ASC).** This operational mode switches all three connections of the electric motor commonly to either **(T+)** or **(T-)**, and therefore provides a short-circuit connection between the **U/V/W** connections of the E-motor.

This is achieved by switching:
- Either all **low-side (low-side ASC)**  
- Or all **high-side (high-side ASC)** IGBTs of the Inverter into conductive state.  

**Figure 5-17:**  
The principle circuit diagram illustrates the low-side active short circuit. All low-side IGBT’s are switched on (conducting), while the high-side IGBT’s are switched off (non-conducting). The freewheeling diodes are displayed for phase U, V, and W, connected to the E-machine.
</page>

<page number="34">
The ASC impedes an active rotation of the E-motor and therefore the generation of mechanical torque. While in ASC mode, the E-motor will produce a brake torque depending on the motor speed. As can be seen, at low motor speed significant torque values are produced and it may influence the drivetrain system.

The MCU shall activate the ASC function under the following conditions:
- EDS is not in the torque control mode or in the freewheeling mode.
- KL30/T30 supply is below a threshold, and Vdc is above the threshold, simultaneously.
- Overvoltage on the DC-link (HV energy network).
- Undervoltage on the DC-link (HV energy network).
- Overcurrent in the E-motor phase connections U/V/W.
- Diagnostic found a hardware fault in the inverter.
- Diagnostic found a fault regarding an operational state of the inverter.
- Safety-relevant CAN communication errors interfering with torque control.
- Errors detected by the monitoring of the torque control path.

Figure 5-18: An example of ASC-Torque on E-motor level.

**Notes:**
- From the two possible options, the low-side ASC should always be primary. Only in case of errors like a short circuit of a high-side IGBT will the high-side ASC be activated automatically.
- The MCU shall provide an autonomous working function (safe state), which keeps the EDS in safe operation conditions, and which does not affect overall powertrain or vehicle safety.
- MCU shall provide an active short circuit function available in continuous operation; maximum torque at wheel shafts should be less than 100Nm.
- Alternatively, MCU shall provide an active voltage control function available in continuous operation; maximum torque at wheel shafts should be less than 100Nm and DC voltage less than 60V (in case of battery main contactors open).
</page>

<page number="35">
The MCU shall provide an autonomous working function (safe state), which keeps the EDS in safe operation conditions, and which does not affect overall powertrain or vehicle safety.

### Functions and Requirements:
1. **Entering:**
   - The MCU shall enter the ASC mode if requested from the VCU. (The request will be transmitted in VCU = “Disable Drive / Stop”).

2. **DC Voltage Gate:**
   - During ASC mode, the MCU shall ensure that no DC voltage is transferred from the E-motor into the DC link circuit.

3. **Over Temperature Protection:**
   - The MCU shall monitor its temperature during ASC and in case of over temperature, switch off the function and inform the VCU.
   - *Remark:* This can be requested by either the VCU or MCU when there is a severe error. In this state, the IGBT is short-circuited to prevent voltage generation from the rotating E-Motor but this results in some drag torque.

4. **VCU Communication:**
   - The MCU shall send the active short circuit status to the VCU as:
     - ASC NOT ACTIVE.
     - ASC ACTIVE.
     - ASC ACTIVATION ERRORS.
   - In case the temperature of the EDS is high and ASC cannot be performed anymore.

### 5.1.5.15 MCU Thermal Management

#### Function Diagram
The diagram demonstrates the interaction between MCU and VCU via the CAN bus:
- Inputs and outputs include coolant flow rate demand (EDS_CoolFlowrate_DMD_FWD), actual coolant flow rate (VCU_DriveCoolWaterFlowRate), and inlet radiator temperature (VCU_DriveCoolInletWaterTemp).

---

#### Signal List
**Table 5-16. Signal list of MCU Thermal Management Function**
- **EDS_CoolFlowrate_DMD_FWD**: Represents coolant flow rate demand from FWD EDS, with an output range from 0 to 25.4 L/min.
- **VCU_DriveCoolWaterFlowRate**: Indicates actual drive cool water flow rate input, ranging from 0 to 25.4 L/min.
- **VCU_DriveCoolInletWaterTemp**: Displays the temperature of the inlet radiator input, ranging from -40°C to 215°C.

---

### Function Description
MCU monitors coolant flow rate demand and temperature inputs, then sends real-time feedback and status data to VCU for thermal management.
</page>

<page number="49">
Vehicle thermal management is divided into two parts: MCU thermal management and VCU thermal management. The VCU calculates the required coolant flow independently, and then takes the larger value as the flow command.

MCU thermal management is divided into IGBT thermal management and motor thermal management. Both of them take the maximum required water flow rate as the MCU required coolant flow rate.

The VCU receives the MCU water flow command via the signal MCU_WaterFlowRateReq, and the real-time water flow is fed back to the MCU via the CAN signal VCU_DriveCoolWaterFlowRate. The coolant inlet sensor temperature measured by the VCU should be sent to the MCU via the CAN signal VCU_DriveCoolInletWaterTemp.

### Notes
- **IGBT thermal management** is divided into five parts, taking the maximum value of the required flow: current limit, temperature limit, NTC temperature limit, locked rotor limit, and fault limit.

#### 1. Current limit:
MCU requests coolant flow according to the current three-phase current. The following table provides reference values. The actual calibration should account for the steady-state junction temperature of the IGBT.

| Current       | Coolant Flow Rate |
|---------------|-------------------|
| >150Arms      | 10 L/min          |
| 100~150Arms   | 6 L/min           |
| 50~100Arms    | 4 L/min           |
| <50Arms       | 2 L/min           |

#### 2. IGBT junction temperature limit:
MCU requests water flow according to the current cooling temperature. The following table provides reference values. Actual calibration should consider the IGBT junction temperature rise speed.

| Temperature Limit | Coolant Flow Rate |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| >155℃             | 10 L/min          |
| 125~155℃          | 6 L/min           |
| 95~125℃           | 4 L/min           |
| <95℃              | 2 L/min           |

#### 3. IGBT NTC temperature limit:
MCU requests water flow based on the current IGBT NTC temperature. The table below provides reference values and requires calibration based on the IGBT NTC temperature rise.

| IGBT NTC Temperature | Coolant Flow Rate |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| >80℃                | 10 L/min          |
| 70~80℃              | 6 L/min           |
| 60~70℃              | 4 L/min           |

Functional Responsibility:

4) Locked-rotor limit.  
If the motor enters the locked-rotor state, it will request a coolant flow rate of 8L/min; otherwise, it will request a flow rate of 2L/min.  

5) Fault limitation.  
If the NTC temperature of the IGBT experiences a three-phase temperature difference check failure or a temperature sampling fault occurs, a coolant flow rate of 8L/min is requested; otherwise, a flow rate of 2L/min is requested.  

Motor thermal management is divided into three parts:
- Motor stator temperature limit.
- Fault limitation.
- Rotor temperature protection limit.

1) Motor stator temperature limit.  
The MCU requests coolant flow according to the current stator temperature. The reference values are shown below:  
- Motor stator limit temperature: >120℃. Coolant flow rate: 10L/min.  
- Motor stator limit temperature: 95~120℃. Coolant flow rate: 6L/min.  
- Motor stator limit temperature: 70~95℃. Coolant flow rate: 4L/min.  
- Motor stator limit temperature: <70℃. Coolant flow rate: 2L/min.

2) Fault Limitation.  
If there is a two-way calibration fault or a sampling fault in the motor temperature, a coolant flow rate of 10L/min is requested; otherwise, a flow rate of 2L/min is requested.  

3) Rotor temperature protection.  
The motor rotor temperature rises faster at high speed, which will be higher than the motor stator temperature. When the motor speed exceeds the back-EMF turning speed (where the back-EMF equals the bus voltage at this speed), a coolant flow rate of 10L/min is requested. Otherwise, the situation requires a flow rate of 2L/min.

5.1.5.16 MCU Active Heating Function.

**Function diagram:**

- The MCU communicates with the VCU via the CAN Bus to manage the active heating function. 
- Signals involved:
  - `VCU_EDS_ActiveHeating_Request`: Represents the activation request from the VCU.
  - `VCU_EDS_HeatPowerDemand`: Indicates the power demand in kilowatts.
  - `EDS_ActiveHeating_state`: Reports the heating function status back to the VCU.

**Signal list (Table 5-17):**
- `VCU_EDS_ActiveHeating_Request`: Input signal to indicate the VCU's request for active heating. Accepts values `0` (“Disable”) and `1` (“Enable”).
- `VCU_EDS_HeatPowerDemand`: Input signal providing the heating demand from the VCU in kilowatts (range: `0`-`10kW`).
- `EDS_ActiveHeating_state`: Output signal indicating the MCU's active heating status (values: `0` (“Disable”) or `1` (“Enable”)).

**Function Description:**
- When CCU sends a heating capacity request to VCU, the VCU calculates the available heat from the E-motor and compressor against the request.
- E-motor heating is activated if required.
- The MCU enables or disables the heating function based on the activation command (`VCU_EDS_ActiveHeating_Request`) and the demanded power (`VCU_EDS_HeatPowerDemand`).
- The MCU provides feedback on the heating status to the VCU via the signal `EDS_ActiveHeating_state`.

### Function description
- When motor speed exceeds 500rpm and the EDS cover is detected to be open, a limp home fault will activate.  
- If electromagnetic torque surpasses 20% of maximum torque and absolute speed is less than a certain threshold, locked rotor limp home fault activates. Recovery occurs if torque reduces below 20% or speed rises above threshold (50rpm).  
- Fault is triggered if resolver excitation sampling or sine/cosine signals of resolver are broken.  
- Limp home fault arises if motor temperature sensors short circuit (one/two).  
- Can0 bus failure (short circuit, open circuit) triggers limp home fault.
