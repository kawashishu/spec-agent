**3. Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions:**  

Technical information table see the SOR.  

The Roof rail is part of the Exterior trim & functional black for Vfe34S.  
It is mounted on top of the vehicle, interfacing with the body side outer and panel roof/steel roof, and is able to load luggage or other items.  
The Roof rails are controlled with 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) with primary, secondary, and tertiary datums defined below in the datum strategy.  
The Roof rail method of manufacture is extrusion moulding.  
The component should be capable of performing in all conditions. The dimensions should be stable, shall have no color or gloss change, and shouldn’t show any detrimental effect when exposed to extreme conditions (-40°C to +100°C).  

**General:**  
The development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies shall be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability. No complaints (zero faults) shall occur at the time of delivery and over the average service life.  

**Overall Function:**  

**Development Targets:**  
- Prevention of functional and quality problems out of known systems.  
- Use of standard and common parts if possible or reasonable.

<page number="9">
Process reliability at production, packaging, transport, and assembly must be ensured. 

Minimized effort is required for overall production sequence including production, packaging, transport, and assembly track side. 

Displacement during processes must be prevented. 

Integration of all pertinent partners in the part package process is essential starting from the concept phase. It necessitates early inclusion of developers of neighboring components.

A general reduction in costs compared to predecessor models is required. 

Improvement of the optical and functional characteristics must be achieved. 

Functionality must be ensured within the requested temperature range.

### Stiffness / Rigidity / Stability of Shape:
- The components and bracket design in the area of operating elements must ensure no instability is noticeable.
- Irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearances, and visible waviness under climatic change loads are prohibited.
- Alignment of component influence with VF department requirements regarding pedestrian protection in the front end is necessary.
- Components must be designed to avoid permanent deformations during all conditions of use, including assembly and production. Air flaps must not flutter under any operating conditions.

### Product Characteristics:
- The function of the component must be proven considering all existing tolerances including heat extension.
- Material-specific thermal expansions must be addressed when defining gap tolerances.
- Deformation after climate tests must fall within the fixed tolerance range for flush and gap dimensions.
- Tolerance analyses must be submitted to responsible departments or personnel.
- Assemblability with adjoining components must be ensured.
- The safety of function under all stated loads in drawings, test specifications, quality guidelines, and legal texts must be guaranteed.
- Avoidance of noise caused by components or joints with unfavorable tolerances is imperative.
- Compliance with legal safety requirements must be documented.
- Components must function across the entire temperature range.

### Interfaces:
Components must guarantee functionality in conjunction with adjoining systems and interfaces. 

Joint and tolerance specifications must align with VF department plans and quality requirements.

The complete vehicle has to pass the following tests:
- Wading tests.
- Splash tests.
- Rain tests with different water flow rates and vehicle in tilted positions.
- Wash tests with all possible kinds of washing methods, including high pressure.
- Dust driving test.
- Wet pollution test (vehicle on wet road behind lead vehicle).
- Icing test in (wet vehicle cooled down in chamber to -20°C).

Basic Requirements for tightness, based on Complete vehicle tightness tests:
- No function-relevant leakage throughout the vehicle life.
- No water entrance into the cabin, also not by the HVAC system.
- Dust entrance, even with open windows, must not exceed a certain level, as described in the tightness requirements.
- Washability to customer satisfaction.
- Passing water pools with high speed and low speed up to fording depth must not cause damage to the vehicle.
- No impairment of function after complete vehicle tightness tests.
- No dirt or water retention in the obstructed condition is allowed.
- Abrasion to the car body must be avoided.
- No other effects which dissatisfy customer (pollution, dropping water, etc.).

Painting:
The secondary surface can in principle be painted but a dedicated analysis and control of the different possible categories of paintings is mandatory to avoid significant performance degradation.  

In general the secondary surface will carry several layers of primer, paint, and varnishes. These layers in combination with the structure material will influence both surface reflection properties and the transmission damping. All kinds of metallic materials prevent or respectively degrade sensor radiation and shall not be used as a second surface.
