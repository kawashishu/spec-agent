5 Description and scope of work.

5.1 Technical requirement.

5.1.1 Project Requirements.

5.1.1.1 Quality Requirements.

Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements."

The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistic specifications, etc.).

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.

The finished assembly should meet all dimensional and form tolerance according to VFDST00000013:

- The assembly structure should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.
- Should be designed for high-volume production.
- Be maintenance free over the vehicle lifetime.
- Emit no disturbing noises.
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.

5.1.1.2 Certification.

- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing. Component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. Suppliers must complete all component/subsystem tests.
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.

The system developer commits to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:
- System-specific requirements.
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of system markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.
- For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time schedule.

The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management. Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of system markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class B and C common platform. VINFAST shall also monitor ongoing changes of rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target SOP.

The supplier delivers the system as module (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated).

Add-on parts are: 

For the release documentation, the following sheets and documents are necessary:

5.3 Material Requirements & Corrosion.

**Additional Requirements**

**Corrosion, Surface:**
For the series, the LOCKING ROD DRIVER will be supplied unpainted by the supplier. The surface is slightly oiled but free of oil accumulations.  
Suitable measures must be provided for material combinations on the support structure, e.g., steel/AL/Mg.  
For corrosion reasons, the parts must be loaded in covered areas protected from weather (rain, snow). Parts must be transported in closed transport vehicles (e.g., trucks with tarpaulin).

**Generally:**  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosively position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
  
1. **Corrosively Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosively Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosively:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosively:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

**Corrosion Tests:**  
The parts have to pass complete vehicle corrosion tests.  

---

5.4 Traceability.

For part requirements, follow specifications as outlined in VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

**Labeling of Parts:**  
Suppliers must adhere to VinFast standard VFDST00000010.

---

6 Testing and Validation and DVP&R.

**DVP and PC Test Responsibility:**  
Testing responsibilities follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for system, subsystem, and component levels are to align with the Complete Vehicle Specification book in the concept phase.  
Detailed test plans for hardware tests in files DVP&R are required and must be coordinated with the Testing & Validation department:

- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirements.  
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).  
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).  
- Duration and timeline of the testing (in the form of a project plan).  
- Part variant and description of the part.
