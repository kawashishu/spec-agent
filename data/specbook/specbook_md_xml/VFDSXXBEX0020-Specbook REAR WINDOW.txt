It will be the supplier's responsibility to ensure receipt of all relevant VinFast testing standards, alongside other standards detailed within the document.  

3.7.1 Test Plan.  
The test plan regulates responsibilities, timelines, and necessary testing devices. It tracks testing results visually and ensures controlled progress. If VinFast requests verification, the supplier (FSS SUP) must provide necessary parts free of charge.  
Testing methods and documentation must be approved by the validation engineer and component lead engineer from VF.  

The test plan must be updated weekly or as new data arises from development changes. Suppliers are responsible for safeguarding their components and ensuring timely planning and approval. Retesting, if required, must also be completed on time. Negative test results necessitate re-planned tests, and costs related to supplier responsibility failures must be borne by the supplier.  

Required inclusions in DVP&R:  
- Standards, norms, and legal requirement declarations.  
- Details showing testing devices, set-up descriptions, and pictures.  
- Responsible testing department.  
- Testing locations (internal/external).  
- Testing timeline/project plan overview.  
- Part variant descriptions.  
- Number of tested components/parts.  

The supplier must use the draft DVP&R provided by the VF testing department, filling initial data within four weeks of nomination.  
DVP planning must cover each development stage, including prototypes and serial stages, with testing and specimen numbers determined jointly by the validation and component lead engineers of VF.  

The test plan must be approved by VinFast departments and the supplier before concept confirmation. Regular weekly reviews are required post-approval. Scheduling delays must prompt supplier proposals to maintain deadlines.  

Test Plan Example:  
Testing updates by the supplier must include weekly status validation, part names, specifications under corresponding standards, and reports from test outcomes.
