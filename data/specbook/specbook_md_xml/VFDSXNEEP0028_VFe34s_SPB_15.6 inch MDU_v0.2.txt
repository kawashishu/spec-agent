## 1 General Document Guidelines

### 1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.  
This version is legally binding.  
This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard.  

Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other. All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).

### 1.2 Language  
This document is written in English.
</page>

<page number="7">
All official project documentations must be prepared in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

### Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document:

- **Shall**
  The word "shall" is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.

- **Should**
  The word "should" is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.

- **May**
  The word "may" is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

#### Vehicle profile  
N/A  

#### Sales Markets
LHD countries include Vietnam (VN), US (North America), and EU (Europe).

#### Production Volume
Refer to the Purchasing Request for Quotation.

### 2 General Project Guidelines

#### 2.1 Development Scope Abstract
This technical specification serves as a written summary of requirements to be considered in the development of the Multimedia Display Unit (MDU).  

The requirements outlined in this technical specification primarily pertain to functional characteristics.  

The Contractor ensures that the development of the components adheres to all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements.  

Any possible cost savings arising from improvements in design, production, or validation details must be reported immediately.  

The contractor is designated as a "System Development Supplier," holding complete responsibility for the supplied system within the specified system boundaries.  

#### 2.2 Initial Situation and Objective
The Multimedia Display Unit (MDU) serves as the primary display for vehicle information, navigation, and media.  

The MDU is linked to the MHU (Multimedia Head Unit) via LVDS/I2C using FPD-Link III (MDU TI).  

The system is designed for use in various vehicle models, accommodating specific country packages and diverse combinations of optional equipment. Adaptation of the system functions to particular vehicles is integral.

|-----------------|------------------------|  
| Vietnam, US, EU, Canada | Multimedia display unit for BEV vehicle Plus |  

#### 2.4 Execution Regulations  
The VF6 vehicle variants will be developed for Vietnam/Asian, US/Canada, and EU markets. Consequently, all vehicle variants shall comply with the regulations and demands of the Vietnam market. Exceptions will be explicitly displayed.  

#### 2.5 Development and Supply Scope  
The supplier status is designated as "System Development Supplier," meaning the supplier is fully responsible for the supplied system within the defined boundaries.  

The responsibilities include:  
- Define, develop, and produce 3D-designs for all parts within the system.  
- Create release drawings.  
- Ensure system functionality.  
- Perform required simulations or calculations on a system level.  
- Validate the system to meet technical targets and tests stated in the specifications.  
- Manage system timing for project management, development, and industrialization.  

#### 2.5.1 Work Interface Chart (RASI)  
**Work Interface Chart (RASI):**  
The supplier obligations are outlined within the RASI chart.  

RASI defines:  
- **R: Responsible** - Responsibility for executing activities to fulfill the requirements; the individual may request necessary support from the project team.  
- **A: Approval** - Accountability for decisions and releases. If no decider is defined, the person responsible for execution (R) takes the role of decider.
</page>

<page number="9">
### Support
The project team member is obligated to actively support execution, even if this requires capacity, expenses, and/or transfer of know-how. The member must proactively assist the person responsible for execution in achieving the targets.

### Information
This member has the right to demand information from the responsible party.

5.17 Mechanical Requirements  

5.17.1 Load  

**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast. The definition of customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in Chapter 5.18.

**Special events:**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. <100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  

The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur, and the intended service life will not be reduced.

**Misuse events:**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact.  

The vehicle must be dimensioned such that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or to neighboring components (principle "deformation before break").

5.17.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance.  

**Fan:**  
If the electrical control unit contains cooling fans no tonal frequency bands are acceptable (adjacent bars must not be exceeded by 3dB).  

**Audio Acoustics:**  
Leakage and rattle-free mounting of the speakers must be possible (wide basket mounting interface, foam ring attached to basket, rigid basket material). Basket front side must allow sealed connection to speaker grille (i.e., through flat surface or foam ring attached).  

The component must be stable over time. No deformation or shrinkage over time, temperature, moisture, dirt, UV radiation allowed. Glues must keep the specified adhesion. This is especially valid for the membrane, suspension, voice coil, dust cap, and membrane glue.  

**S&R, General:**  
Noises which are perceived by the customers as disturbing have to be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier has to guarantee that components are free of disturbing noise in their vehicle environment and their geometrical integration. Similarly, at vehicle- and audio system excitation under all environmental conditions and over the fixed component service life. There must not be squeak and rattle noise due to excitation of the body (wind load, torsional flexing, etc.) if real relative movements evolve on the surface.  

This has to be guaranteed over the whole operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity). To evidence disturbing noise freedom, the requirements must be coordinated with the responsible testing team.  

The supplier is responsible for supporting the development of vibration and acoustic behavior of the subsystem within the complete vehicle environment and has to ensure constant acoustic quality of delivered parts. This includes the active support of pointing out problems as well as making proposals to solve them actively. The supplier must deliver necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation as requested free of charge.  

5.18 Durability / Life Time.  
The durability is 10 years or 160,000 km (whichever comes first).
