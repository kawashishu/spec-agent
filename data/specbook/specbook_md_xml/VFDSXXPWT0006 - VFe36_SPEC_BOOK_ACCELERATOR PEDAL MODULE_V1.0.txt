### 3 Terms

#### 3.1 Pedal Angle
The pedal angle is the angle which the pedal plate describes about its axis of rotation at the midpoint of the film hinge. The pedal angle is specified in degrees of angle [°] as well as in percent [%] of the mechanically maximum possible pedal angle if required.

*Figure 1*: This figure represents the XZ section through the accelerator pedal module, showing its schematic diagram in the motor vehicle coordinate system according to DIN ISO 4130.

---

#### 3.2 Force Application Point
The force application point is the point on the pedal plate at which force is applied to actuate the accelerator pedal module.  

- The distance of the force application point from the pivot axis of the pedal plate is always measured vertically with respect to the pedal plate.  
- By default, the force application point on the pedal plate is located at a distance of 175 mm from its pivot axis.

---

#### 3.3 Actuating Forces
The actuating forces are the forces applied by the driver's foot to the accelerator pedal module during operation.
</page>

<page number="6">
3.4 Misuse forces.  
Misuse forces are the forces that are applied as the result of irregular operation such as pressing down on the accelerator pedal while entering the vehicle.  

3.5 Pedal position sensor.  
The pedal position sensor registers the pedal angle defined by the driver and converts it into proportional electrical signals.  

4 Coordinate system.  
The accelerator pedal is to be represented in a clockwise rotating, orthogonal coordinate system (Fig. 2). The origin of the coordinate system is located at the base of the module on the mounting plane of the screw connection point to the body. The Z-axis is projected upward in the direction of the screw axis with positive values, while the Y-axis runs to the right (viewed in the direction of travel) parallel to the axis of rotation of the film hinge with positive values.  

**Figure 2.** Coordinate system of the accelerator pedal module.  

5 Functional requirements.  
The accelerator pedal module is arranged in the installation area “Interior, without special requirement.” Consequently, this arrangement gives rise to the ambient conditions (e.g., temperature spectrum and test duration) in accordance with VFDST00028131.  

In view of its installation location, the accelerator pedal module is subjected to dry dust, dust containing grease, snow, snow slush, water, ice, moist dirt, sharp-edged stones, metal and/or magnetic parts, as well as corrosive media such as thawing salt, lubricants, and brake fluid.  

Subjection to electromagnetic vibration from mobile telephones and DVD players, for instance, is to be expected (see VFDST00034902).  

Stress and strain produced in the accelerator pedal module as the result of increased temperatures or vibration excitations are to be taken into account in the design layout.

<page number="7">
5.1 Requirements relating to the operating mechanism of the accelerator pedal module.  
The accelerator pedal module is designed such that the pivot axis of the pedal plate is arranged below the standard force application point of the driver’s foot as defined in section 3.2 ("Upright accelerator pedal"). It is equipped with two spring elements, not hindering each other, to ensure the legally required self-reset of the pedal plate, which also serves to provide operational feedback for the driver. The pedal angle that can be produced by the actuating force is limited by solid, dampened stops. The mechanically realized pedal angle must be 16° ± 0.5°.

5.1.1 Basic force/angle characteristic.  
The force-angle characteristic shown in Figure 3 is realized and must be ensured at room temperature. Extreme temperature specifications apply as defined in VFDST00034902. All specified values refer to the standard force application point defined in section 3.2.  

In the variant for automatic transmission vehicles, the kick-down force boost described in section 5.1.2 is superimposed on this basic characteristic.

**Figure 3.** Force characteristic for manual transmission vehicles.  
The characteristic curve must exhibit the following properties:  
- Entry in the characteristic curve:  
  The entry in the characteristic curve should be as small as possible (target: 0.2°) and must occur within the first 0.5° pedal angle without overshoot.  
- Runout of characteristic curve before end stop:  
  (Details are not provided but subject to further development.)

### 5.1 Requirements relating to the operating mechanism of the accelerator pedal module

The accelerator pedal module is to be designed such that the pivot axis of the pedal plate is arranged below the standard force application point of the driver’s foot as defined in section 3.2 ("Upright accelerator pedal"). The accelerator pedal module must be equipped with two spring elements, not hindering each other, for the purpose of producing the legally required self-reset of the pedal plate which also serves the purpose of providing operational feedback for the driver. The pedal angle that can be produced by the actuating force must be limited by solid, dampened stops.

The mechanically realized pedal angle must be 16° ± 0.5°.

---

### 5.1.1 Basic force/angle characteristic

The force-angle characteristic shown in **Figure 3** is to be realized and must be ensured at room temperature. The specifications defined in **VFDST00034902** apply in terms of extreme temperatures. All specified values refer to the standard force application point in accordance with section 3.2.  

In the variant for automatic transmission vehicles, the kick-down force boost described in section 5.1.2 is to be superimposed on this basic characteristic.

**Figure 3** displays the force characteristic for manual transmission vehicles.  

#### Properties of the characteristic curve:
- **Entry in the characteristic curve:**  
  The entry in the characteristic curve should be as small as possible (target: 0.2°) and must take place within the first 0.5° pedal angle without overshoot.  

- **Runout of characteristic curve before end stop:**  
  The runout of the characteristic curve should be as small as possible and must take place within the last 0.3° pedal angle before the mechanical end stop.  

- **Position of characteristic curve:**  
  The position of the rising branch of the characteristic curve is defined by the characteristic of the pedal force shown in **Figure 4**.

---

**Figure 4** illustrates the pedal force characteristic, specifically the rising branch for manual transmission vehicles.

---

### Additional Characteristic Curve Requirements:
- **Gradient of characteristic curve:**  
  The gradient of the pedal characteristic curve must be within the following value range:  
  `0.8 N/° ≤ m ≤ 1.3 N/°`  
  Where *m* represents the force differential [N]/angle differential [°].  
  Deviations from the gradient of the characteristic curve must not result in the positional tolerances of the characteristic curve defined in **Figure 4** being exceeded, even if they fall within the specified range for the gradient.

- **Linearity of the characteristic curve:**  
  The deviation of the pedal force from the target force must remain less than 2 N over the angle range from 0.5° to 13°.

- **Hysteresis:**  
  The force-angle characteristic must exhibit a distinct hysteresis of the actuating force with rising and falling changes in angle. The difference in actuating force between the rising and falling branches must be 40% of the value of the falling branch at each angle value and must not deviate from the specified value by more than -2 N and +3 N. A minimum return force of 5 N must be ensured.

<page number="9">
5.1.2 Kick-down force boost for automatic modules.
To facilitate use in automatic transmission vehicles, a pedal force boost, referred to as the kick-down force boost (KD), is to be superimposed on the basic characteristic from section 5.1.1 in the end area of the pedal angle.  

**Figure 5**  
This diagram illustrates the force characteristic for the automatic module, specifying the KD superimposed properties.

The superimposed characteristic of the kick-down force boost must exhibit the following properties:  
- **Starting point of kick-down force boost (KD start):**  
The kick-down force boost must start at a pedal angle of 13.2° at the earliest and 1.6° at the latest before the mechanical end stop in the rising branch of the pedal angle change.

- **KD Force boost:**  
The maximum force boost must be (40 +5 / -10) N compared to KD start.  

- **Force decline (KD decline):**  
The ratio between KD force decline and KD force boost must range between 3:7 and 6:7.  

- **The ratio between force rise (KD rise) and force drop (KD decline):**  
This ratio must remain between 1:1.6 and 1:3.  

- **End point of kick-down force boost (KD end):**  
The kick-down force boost must end in the decreasing branch of the pedal angle change at a point 1.6° before the mechanical end stop at the earliest and 13.2° pedal angle at the latest.  

The resulting kick-down haptics is to be coordinated with the constituent’s corresponding technical department.
</page>

<page number="10">
5.2 Operational safety.  
The outer surfaces and edges of the accelerator pedal module, with which contact can be made during assembly and vehicle use, must exhibit no sharp burrs.  

5.3 Actuating characteristic.  
The response characteristics, proportionability, and pedal travel are defined by the functional requirements in section 5.1. The resulting actuating characteristic in the vehicle is to be coordinated with the corresponding constituent’s technical department.  

5.4 Acoustics.  
The accelerator pedal module must not radiate any disturbing mechanical vibrations. This requirement applies to functional, operational, and interfering noises both to air-borne noise as well as structure-borne noise excitation. Noises produced during operation or by any other influences (e.g., knocking against the accelerator pedal module with the foot) must not produce perceivable reverberations.  

A quiet noise without reverberations as part of the kick-down force boost is permitted in agreement with the corresponding technical departments.  

5.5 Strength requirements.  
**5.5.1 Operating strength.**  
The accelerator pedal module must retain its operability in full over the required service life. Verification of this requirement is to be provided by the tests described in VFDST00034902. In addition, the constituent shall perform an operating strength test in the vehicle at the same time as testing the acoustic and functional properties.  

**5.5.2 Failure characteristics.**  
In the case of pollution (e.g., sand, water) or at operating forces applied in misuse situations, precautions must be taken, even in combination with extreme temperatures, to ensure that the pedal cannot jam as the result of sticking or snagging. The possibility of instabilities occurring in the force-angle characteristic (stick-slip effect), the sticking of the pedal plate or a signal being output to the control unit contrary to the driver’s choice must be ruled out.  

The accelerator pedal module must be designed to clearly identify damages by misuse of the driver. At misuse, a defined damage chain must be complied with.  

After a crash, the accelerator pedal module shall not have any sharp edges or fractures, leading to an injury of the driver’s foot. Thus, for the housing, no brittle materials shall be used that may split. A glass fiber content of the housing material of > 30% must be avoided.

<page number="11">
5.6 Corrosion.  
The surfaces of metal parts of the accelerator pedal module are to be coated corresponding to the requirement defined by VFDST00000100 for drawing parts or by VFDST00007000 for minor corrosion stress (corrosion protection value 1). Non-coated parts must successfully complete the tests described in VFDST00034902 without corrosion of the base material and without visual and functional impairment.

5.7 Requirements relating to the sensor system.  
The task of the sensor system is to precisely and unambiguously register the angle position of the accelerator pedal and convert it to a voltage signal proportional to the pedal angle.  
The sensor system is to be arranged in a redundant configuration so that two independent voltage signals at U1 = 2 x U2 are made available by two galvanically isolated sensors. The power is supplied through the engine management. Each measurement channel is to be operated by its own separate voltage source.  
The requirements relating to the output signals of the accelerator pedal module as described in the following sections are to be met under all operating temperature conditions and over the entire service life of the accelerator pedal module. The requirements refer to electric circuitry of the signal outputs conforming to VFDST00034902.

5.7.1 Electrical characteristics.  
Output signals outside the value ranges defined in the following are interpreted as errors by the evaluator systems in the vehicle and, for this reason, must not occur as part of trouble-free operation of the accelerator pedal module.

5.7.1.1 Electric characteristics of the manual transmission variant.  
Figure 6 shows the progression of the two output signals in terms of quality over the pedal angle. The progression of the pedal force hysteresis is also shown to illustrate the interrelationships.

Figure 6: The Force / Voltage angle diagram includes the following:
- The sensor voltage (markers indicate electric idle and electric full throttle conditions).  
- Voltage sensor 1 and voltage sensor 2 produce consistent readings across the pedal angle range.  
- The diagram illustrates a rising angle-to-voltage trend corresponding to pedal actuation.
- The variation in pedal force hysteresis supports operational performance consistency across manual transmissions.

| Sensor 2 at end stop | U2 | 40 | ±2.6 (Misuse +5 %) |

5.6 Corrosion.  
The surfaces of metal parts of the accelerator pedal module are to be coated corresponding to the requirement defined by VFDST00000100 for drawing parts or by VFDST00007000 for minor corrosion stress (corrosion protection value 1). Non-coated parts must successfully complete the tests described in VFDST00034902 without corrosion of the base material and without visual and functional impairment.  

5.7 Requirements relating to the sensor system.

5.7.1 Electrical characteristics.  
Output signals outside the value ranges defined in the following are interpreted as errors by the evaluator systems in the vehicle and, for this reason, must not occur as part of trouble-free operation of the accelerator pedal module.  

5.7.1.1 Electric characteristics of the manual transmission variant.  
Figure 6 shows the progression of the two output signals in terms of quality over the pedal angle. The progression of the pedal force hysteresis is also shown to illustrate the interrelationships.

¹ Values only for information purposes.  
² Misuse +5%.

As shown in Figure 7, the threshold for KD-ON on the rising branch of the pedal force characteristic must be located immediately after the maximum KD force. The threshold for KD-OFF must be max. 0.5° "after" the maximum KD force on the decreasing branch of the pedal force characteristic.  

5.7.2 Signal quality.  
All output signals are to be output either infinitely variable or with a minimum resolution of 10 bits (referred to the voltage range from 0 V to UB).  

- **Linearity:**  
The linearity ∆U(ϕ) at a constant supply voltage UB (from the interval 4.5 V ≤ UB ≤ 5.5 V) at the pedal angle ϕ is to be assessed in terms of a regression straight line y = αϕ + b over the measuring range (total actuating range of pedal) from 0 - 16° pedal angle (independent linearity).  
∆U(ϕ) = Umess(ϕ) - (αϕ + b),  
where Umess(ϕ) is a sensor voltage value of the accelerator pedal module at the angle ϕ. The permissible deviations are defined in Table 3.  

- **Micro linearity ∆m:**  
The micro linearity at the point ϕ (pedal angle) at the angle interval ∆ϕ ([ϕ - ∆ϕ/2, ϕ + ∆ϕ/2]) is  
∆m(ϕ) = Umess(ϕ) - y∆ϕ(ϕ).  
Umess(ϕ) is a sensor value of the accelerator pedal module at the angle ϕ and y∆ϕ = βϕ + c is the linear regression of the sensor characteristic at the angle interval ∆ϕ. The permissible deviations are defined in Table 3.  

**Table 3: Signal quality.**  
| Description                  | Condition         | Min    | Max    | Unit    |

5.7 Signal Quality Requirements

The signal quality must be guaranteed over the entire temperature range and service life of the accelerator pedal module. The sensor system must be designed such that a change in the output signal occurs 1.5 ms at the latest after a change in the actuation angle. The signal must have executed at least 63% of the change within this time (including dead time).

5.7.3 Electrical Requirements

If not otherwise specified, the requirements defined in VFDST00028122 shall apply. The requirements defined in VFDST00027101-02-05 must be taken into account during the development of the accelerator pedal module.

### 5.7.3.1 Operating Voltage

The nominal operating voltage at the supply connections of the accelerator pedal module is UN = 5.0 V.  
The pedal position sensor is to be designed for operating voltages from 4.5 V ≤ UB ≤ 5.5 V.  

All required properties must not be influenced by voltage fluctuations within this range (taking into account the ratiometry specified in section 5.7.1).  

The voltage progression over the time between 0 V and operating voltage UB while switching on and off can be arbitrary. This must not cause damage to or functionally impair the accelerator pedal module.  

The internal resistance of the power supply unit can adopt the following values:  
0 < Ri ≤ 33 Ω  

### 5.7.3.2 Current Intake

No sensor must exceed the current intake values specified in Table 4.

#### Table 4 Current Intake Values

|---------------------------|---------------------|-----|------|------|
