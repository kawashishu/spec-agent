Scope. 

VinFast (VinFast Trading and Production Limited Liability Company) has started to design and develop a new BEV SUV vehicle. Environmental impact and sustainability of the program are taken into account as essential target features. This SPB shall provide details for all components for mass production of the VF8 BASE Program. 

Figure 1: USS CAD Model. 
The figure depicts a computer-aided design (CAD) model showcasing two side views of the ultrasonic sensor used in the VF8 BASE Program. It highlights the structural design, alignment, and dimensions of the component intended for the BEV SUV.

7 USS Functions.

7.3 Ultrasonic Sensor.

The ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles in front and rear of the vehicle by transmitting ultrasonic waves. The ultrasonic waves that return upon encountering obstacles are converted into electrical signals and sent to the Master Sensor. The Master Sensor processes the collected data, calculates obstacles, and determines the relevant distance and position information. This information is transmitted to the instrument and HMI through the CAN bus. The HMI speaker provides an audible alarm, while the HMI displays the obstacle information.

The system includes a self-checking function, which issues an audible alarm and displays the corresponding fault information on the HMI if a fault is detected.

7.3 USS Functions

7.3.1 Ultrasonic Sensor  
The ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles in front and rear of the vehicle by transmitting ultrasonic waves. It converts the reflected ultrasonic waves into electrical signals and sends them to the Master Sensor. The Master Sensor processes the data, calculates the obstacles' distance and position, and transmits relevant information through the CAN bus to the instrument and HMI. The HMI speaker provides a sound alarm, and the HMI displays obstacle information.   
The system includes a self-checking function. If a fault is detected, an audible alarm is given, and the fault is displayed on the HMI.

NA.

7.5.6 Fault Operation.
There are two failure types: temporary failure and permanent failure.

- If the "Temporary failure recovery condition" is satisfied during the same ignition cycle, reset is made from the "Temporary Failure State." If reset is made from the failure, confirmedDTC is set as 0 and testFailed is set to 0.
- If the "Permanent failure recovery condition" is satisfied during the same ignition cycle, reset is made from the "Permanent Failure State." If reset is made from the failure, confirmedDTC is set as 1 and testFailed is set to 0.

The timing of failure diagnostics for which there is no reset from the failure state during the same ignition cycle is described in Diagnostics Timing in "Table Failure Codes." The Status of DTC for each of the failure states is as follows:

Failure State:
- Temporary failure: testFailed = 1, confirmedDTC = 1.
- Temporary failure reset: testFailed = 0, confirmedDTC = 0.
- Permanent Failure: testFailed = 1, confirmedDTC = 1.
- Permanent Failure reset: testFailed = 0, confirmedDTC = 1.
