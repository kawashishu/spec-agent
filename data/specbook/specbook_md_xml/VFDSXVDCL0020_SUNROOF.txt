5.2 General CAE Requirements  
Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL.  

5.3 Material Requirement  

**Generally:**  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, and road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, and road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity.  

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  

Avoid water and dirt accumulation; always provide drainage at the lowest positions.

  Cooperation with the VinFast Vehicle Safety Department:  
  The supplier is responsible to support the integration of vehicle safety functions actively. Lifetime relevant laws, ratings of selling markets, and OEM requirements must be taken into account.  

#### General Demands
The supplier must consider the following points:  
- Vehicle safety functions must be maximally prepared at the system level through expertise, CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering), and testing.  
- Project-relevant supplier data must be handed over to VinFast on request and free of charge. VinFast is allowed to forward this data to other parties within the project.  
- Target fulfillment of performances with spread effects must be secured through an adequate number of worst results in identical test series.
</page>

<page number="27">
Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand, including support to achieve vehicle data freeze milestones. These must be realized using LsDyna and validated as numerical and physically stable. 

FE meshes must be homogenous, aligned with part axes/geometry, and have a density of 8-10mm. Non-conforming meshing must be reworked.

For generating validated CAE material cards, planning, execution, and financing of principle tests on systems and components is the supplier’s responsibility.

Suppliers must define a test matrix adhering to full vehicle timing demands. Before higher-scale testing (e.g., sled or vehicle crash tests), supplier optimization test series must be completed.

Supplier-specific parts for testing activities must be provided free of charge to relevant testing facilities. Any costs related to physical parts or CAE models needed by the supplier must also be accounted for by the supplier.

Requests from VinFast’s vehicle crash optimization process must be accepted without additional costs. This includes material definitions, material thicknesses, additional parts, and optimization work.

**General Requirements:**
- A mandatory 20% safety margin must be applied to each single target value.
- Occupant survival area integrity against part behavior and fluids must be ensured, including indirect/contact parts.
- Edges must be at least 3.2mm thick during and after impact.
- Electrical system integrity must be maintained during impact and post-crash functions.
- Relevant tolerances must be taken into consideration.
- Robust target achievement must be ensured.
- Asymmetries need detailed investigation on both sides until a reliable worst-case scenario is confirmed by VinFast.
- Ratings must not include modifiers.

**Additional Specific Demands:**
- Non-exhaustive list: parties must track actions for any issues by obtaining parts/data/CAE models from further suppliers.
- Test devices such as bucks, sleds, etc., must be set up by suppliers using incomplete parts (e.g., non-prepared BIW used as a sled).

When targets are fulfilled partially or fully on a system level, the supplier must prepare homologation or certification documents for submission to VinFast free of charge.

For carry-over parts/systems, system requirements can be verified by donor vehicle performance data.
</page>

<page number="28">
**Additional Requirements**

The actuators are one part of the APSS (active pedestrian safety system) and ensure that the hood is in upright position in time, to protect pedestrians in case of impact. The main parameters for the actuators include piston stroke, piston force, and retaining force (compare chapter 2.3.3). The force during activation should not be too high due to oscillation of the hood and hinges based on high energy input, but it should not be too low after activation (retaining force) to prevent dummies from moving down the hood with their body mass before the head impacts the hood.

All the components must function properly within the specified temperature and humidity range:
- Temperature range: -30°C to +85°C
- Relative humidity: 10% - 95%

The supplier is responsible for verifying through a sufficient number of hardware tests that both the activation time and the required forces (as described in 2.3.3) are achieved at the lower boundary, room temperature, and upper boundary of the specified temperature and humidity range. All these hardware tests must be conducted utilizing state-of-the-art testing methods, including:
- Climatic chamber combined with a fall tower
- High-speed video capture
- Measurement of force vs. time and activation height vs. time

The fixation brackets for the actuators must withstand all activation forces during the aforementioned environmental and thermal conditions, without significant elastic or plastic deformation. The supplier must ensure that the "popping up the hood" functionality remains viable even if deformation in the fixation brackets occurs. For instance, the piston must not slip from the hinge counterpart due to bracket deformation during the activation and holding process.

The supplier is required to provide components for testing and, if necessary, for actuator tuning. Additionally, the supplier must participate in local testing and troubleshooting processes by providing access to specialists.

### Safety Goals and Relevant Safety Requirements
The supplier must provide the following safety goals and relevant safety requirements along with their assigned ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level), if already available, depending on the scope of the supplier's quotation. 

#### Safety Goal Requirements:
- Inclusion of Safety Goals and Functional Safety Requirements, along with associated attributes.  
- If the ASIL is not known at the time of supplier selection, a conservative assumption can be employed.

**Note:** Documentation specifying all safety goals and attributes associated with functional safety requirements is mandatory.
</page>

<page number="29">
ONLY case where the requirement may state what not to do:

- **FTTI:** Attribute of the safety goal as well as a safe state.  
- **ASIL:** Attribute of the safety goal.

**System requirement**  
No signal name per set should appear in the requirement; only physical entities (speed, acceleration, yaw, etc.) as controlled or perceived by the user of the system or information entities (e.g., accelerator pedal) if the item is a subsystem of the vehicle.  

Requirements may be assigned to subsystems already or only to the systems (i.e., refer to the system as per ISO definition and item definition).  

- **FTTI:** Most of the time inherited from the safety goal. Potentially, the FTTI is already decomposed (see below ASIL decomposition).  
- **ASIL:** Likely no ASIL decomposition at that stage, but possible if the item is a subsystem of the vehicle interacting with an existing subsystem to mitigate a risk.  
  Example: The distributed safety architecture (VCU) will detect any excursion of vehicle acceleration and shut down the electric machine torque in case of a detected hazardous scenario.
