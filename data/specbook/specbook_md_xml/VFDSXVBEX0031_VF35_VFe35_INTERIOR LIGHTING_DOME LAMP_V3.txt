### Emissions & Toxicology: 
This section is not applicable.
</page>

<page number="15">
Pyrotechnic initiator neutralization:  
Not applicable.

Recycling:  
**Recycled materials**  
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’). Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert’s team at VinFast.  

**Recycling scheme**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  
- Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
- The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  
- Recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

**Evaporative emissions:**  
Not applicable.

**Drainage and depollution:**  
Complete drainage of fluids is required for safe and environmentally friendly End of Life vehicle treatment. For complete removal of fluid niches and pockets shall be avoided.  
- Drainage scheme including virtual or physical test protocol with information on type of drained fluids, amount of drained fluids (in weight-%) and absolute mass of drained fluid in kg has to be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

**Material Requirements & Corrosion**  
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation.  

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected.
</page>

<page number="16">
**Material Requirements and Corrosion Guidelines**

1. **Corrosivity Classification for Components:**
   - **Low Corrosivity:** Applies to positions not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
   - **Medium Corrosivity:** Applies to positions minimally affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road spray.
   - **High Corrosivity:** Default for exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
   - **Very High Corrosivity:** Applies to positions exposed to road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

   The exterior of the vehicle is generally categorized as an area with high corrosivity.

2. **Material Selection and Protection Measures:**
   - Material combinations should prevent galvanic corrosion. Fasteners and attached brackets with critical material combinations must have proper coatings (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).
   - Ensure drainage at the lowest points and avoid dirt traps where sand can cause abrasive damage.
   - Contact surfaces should be dry, non-abrasive, minimize micro-movement, and provide sufficient edge coverage with burr-free finishes.

3. **Corrosion Test Requirements:**
   - Components undergo both system/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion testing based on the following standards:
     - **Salt Spray Test (Metallic Surfaces):** ISO 9227.
     - **Cyclic Corrosion Test (Organic Coatings):** ISO 11997 Cycle B.

4. **Specific Test Criteria:**
   | **Area**                  | **Corrosivity**          | **Metallic Coatings**              | **Organic Coatings**                                   | **Pass Criteria**          |

Electric parts.

Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This requirement includes fasteners and attached brackets. Direct contact with more noble metals, such as steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness, must be avoided. 

Surface treatment on steel fasteners must be long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials. Electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion. Terminals and connectors must not be placed on the lowest points, as this increases the risk of moisture exposure. Tightness is essential for electrical connections to remain protected from humidity. Grounding connections must also be water-tight if in a corrosive environment. 

Aluminium alloys with a copper and iron content of greater than 1% must be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Corrosion may quickly penetrate such seals, allowing moisture to access the component.

Prevention of stone chipping issues.

The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be mitigated through design measures:
- Provide shielding parts for components prone to damage.
- Enlarge radii of parts in high-risk areas to reduce the severity of damage.
- Select part materials and paint with matching colors in high-risk areas to conceal any visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid designing parts with edges oriented toward the vehicle’s driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on lower vehicle areas, deepen their positioning to minimize exposure to stone impacts.

Test Plan.

The test plan outlines by whom and when tests will be conducted, as well as the required testing devices. This plan also monitors testing progress with visual documentation of results. Ensuring the integrity of test outcomes is critical. If VinFast chooses to verify test results independently, the supplier must provide the required parts free of charge. 

Test procedures and documentation must be validated by the appropriate validation engineer and component lead engineer at VinFast. Weekly updates or adjustments stemming from development changes must be incorporated into the test plan.

<page number="19">
The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the component lies with the SDS. Testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results within the committed schedule. The SDS has to ensure that VinFast receives all relevant test protocols and reports for verification and attends any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast and SDS.

If testing is conducted with incorrect parts, missing parts, or using a different testing procedure, the testing must be redone at the cost of the SDS. If negative test results occur, retesting must be planned and funded by the SDS if the failure is their responsibility.

### Data required in DVP&R includes:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, or legal requirement.
- Description of testing set-up, including devices and pictures.
- Responsible test department.
- Location of testing (internal/external).
- Duration and time schedule of testing (presented as a project plan).
- Part variant and part description.
- Number of tested components/parts.

### DVP&R Agreement
The DVP&R must be agreed upon by T&V (VinFast), SQA (VinFast), and SDS before concept confirmation. Following confirmation, the DVP&R will be reviewed weekly. In case of scheduling delays, the SDS must deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule. Upon request, the SDS should draw up a test plan for each individual component.

### Failure Analysis
If VinFast conducts a test and identifies a failure, the root cause will be analyzed. If the supplier is responsible, they must assume full responsibility, while VinFast will offer support to resolve the issue. Suppliers are permitted to attend centralized tests.

### 3.3 General CAE Requirements
- Document: **VFSRXXCVC0201**
- Title: **VFCAE-001-FEM-GENERAL_Analysis requirement**

# 7 Supplier Responsibilities

**Supplier Responsibilities:**
The supplier is responsible for providing/ensuring the completion of tasks outlined in the work requirements. These responsibilities are itemized to mitigate risks of an employer-employee relationship under the contract.

## Customer Service Requirements

### After-Sales Spare Parts Should Be Ready at Startup:
Suppliers must ensure that spare parts are available at the beginning of whole vehicle production.

### Spare Parts Support Cycle:
The support period for after-sales spare parts must meet the lifecycle requirements of the project in line with the GTC, even after VINFAST ceases vehicle production, unless otherwise specified.

### Maintenance Information of After-Sales Spare Parts:
First-level assembly suppliers must provide VINFAST's after-sales engineering department with design and maintenance information prior to OTS. This includes:
- BOM table
- Parts structure and function description
- Fault diagnosis
- Special tools for maintenance
- Relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearances, parts performance parameters)

### 12 Appearance Approval Process  

The Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is applicable for suppliers providing components affecting CMF (Color, Material, and Finish) appearance. These components require VinFast approval prior to PPAP deliverables. This report ensures that the final product has been inspected by VinFast Design Quality and meets all specified appearance requirements.

Harmony review is particularly important to confirm that the components maintain a homogeneous quality with adjacent parts.

Design Quality requires all suppliers to submit non-commercial sample parts. Suppliers are also required to submit:  
- **Complete assembly parts (P-level)** known as purchase parts.  
- **Child parts (D-level)** known as component parts.  

The quantity of parts to be submitted is specified in VFDST00038401 for further details.
