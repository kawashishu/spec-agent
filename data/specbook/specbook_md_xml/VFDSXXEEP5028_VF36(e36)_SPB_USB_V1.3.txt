2 General Project Guidelines.

2.1 Development Scope Abstract.  
This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the USB Sockets.  
The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics. The contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements. Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details have to be reported immediately.  
The contractor is a ‘Full Service Supplier,’ with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.  

2.2 Initial Situation and Objective.  
The USB Socket is a new development component that controls the charging process of attached USB peripherals. Through the implementation of testing and vehicle performance verification, the goal is to meet the performance design requirements of the Socket.

2.4 Execution Regulations.  
The supplier must ensure that the developed parts meet the specified requirements of VinFast, obtain the type certification of the parts, and submit all necessary documents to support the type certification of the whole vehicle.  
When synchronous development is completed, suppliers must provide the necessary documentation to prove that their products have met the required regulatory requirements, including but not limited to ISO26262.  

2.5 Development and Supply Scope.  
The supplier status is "Full Service Supplier," which means that the supplier has complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries. This responsibility includes the following:  
- Define, develop, and 3D-design all parts within the system.  
- Create release drawings.  
- Ensure the function of the system.  
- Perform any required simulations or calculations on system level.  
- Validate the system according to the technical targets and tests stated in this specification.  
- Address system timing in terms of project management, development, and industrialization.

2.8.3 Type Approval and Certification.  
VinFast is responsible for the integration and certification of the vehicle grade system. Vehicle-level certification projects include urban simulation road tests and enhanced road tests. Suppliers of spare parts/subsystems will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found in the process of integration and certification of vehicle-level systems. All countermeasures to resolve issues addressed in the failure report must be executed by the supplier and approved by PPAP.

The integration and certification of components/subsystems is the responsibility of the supplier of components/subsystems. The supplier must complete all parts/subsystems tests. 

The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or by the supplier appointing a lower supplier or a third party after VinFast approval. However, in any case, the supplier is obliged to complete all specified test requirements. 

The supplier of parts/subsystems must provide the VinFast Product Release Engineer with a complete test certification plan for parts/subsystems and obtain the approval of the Engineer. The plan should include at least the number of specimens, test sequences, place, and time of each test.

2.9 Quality and Reliability  

2.9.1 Quality Concepts.  
Supplier must satisfy the quality commitment made to VinFast, which is to guarantee 100 waste products per 1,000,000 pieces of spare parts sent to VinFast. PPM ≤ 100, CPK ≥ 1.33.

2.9.2 Risk Management.  
The supplier shall notify the VinFast Product Release Engineer in writing of any potential technical matters, such as problems, accidents, latest information, project changes, etc., which may lead to increased costs, delays in project nodes and plans, and delivery delays. The supplier’s written notice should include a specific repair plan, a risk assessment, and a description of the overall project schedule.

2.9.3 Validation of the SW Development.  
The supplier shall regularly report to VinFast the relevant design input factors and provide engineering support. At the same time, suppliers should attend supplier development meetings and complete necessary design validation. 

If there are inconsistencies with the specified specification requirements, the supplier should work with VinFast to solve the problem. Suppliers also need to provide VinFast with competent on-site service personnel to support VinFast in resolving problems associated with supplier parts in vehicle assembly during the vehicle start-up phase.

2.10 Content Amendments.  
The supplier shall notify the VinFast Product Release Engineer in writing of any potential technical matters, such as problems, accidents, latest information, project changes, etc., which may lead to increased costs, delays in project nodes and plans, and delivery delays. The supplier's written notice should include a specific repair plan, a risk assessment, and a description of the overall project schedule.

### 5.8 Safety Requirements.
#### 5.8.1 Vehicle Safety regarding Person and Passenger Protection.
##### 5.8.1.1 Safety Goals.
The supplier is responsible to actively support the integration of vehicle safety functions.

Lifetime relevant laws and ratings of selling markets as well as OEM requirements must be considered.

Vehicle system reliable operation is achieved by all sub-component integration. VinFast, in partnership with suppliers, guarantees the vehicle’s intended operating function is free of electronic malfunction by following the process outlined in ISO26262.

The supplier is to conduct assessments as needed including but not limited to FTA, DFMEA, PFMEA, STPA, HAZOP, etc. It is expected that functional safety risks should be reviewed with actions identified or confirmed in the design (including inspection of hardware and software design principles) and manufacturing (manufacturing processes, validation of design processes, and verification of conformance with production processes).
