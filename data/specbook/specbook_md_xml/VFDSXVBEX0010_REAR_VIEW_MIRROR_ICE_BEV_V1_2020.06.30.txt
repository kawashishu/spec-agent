Function.

The Outer Mirrors are part of a system that provides an aesthetically pleasing exterior surface, promotes model distinction, protects the BIW against local water intrusion, enhances aerodynamics, avoids and/or reduces water on the side windows, and provides support, location, and attachment of roof carrier systems. Outer Mirror, "Devices for indirect vision," means devices intended to give a clear view of the rear, side, or front of the vehicle within the fields of vision defined in UN-R 46 paragraph 15.2.4. These can be conventional mirrors, camera-monitors, or other devices able to present information about the indirect field of vision to the driver.

The main functions of the Outer Rear View mirror are:
- Provide an indirect mirrored view of rear traffic.
- Provide a visible light signal indicating the turning direction.
- Adjust the field of view for different seat positions.
- Prevent frosting or humidity on mirror glass.
- Reduce the width of the automobile through head folding.
- Fold the mirror head around a defined folding axis.

Overall Function.

Development targets:
- Prevention of functional and qualitative problems from known systems.
- Use of standard and common parts if possible or reasonable.
- Process reliability at production, packaging, transport, and assembly.
- Minimize effort for the overall production sequence: production, packaging, transport, and assembly on the line.
- Prevention of displacement.
- Integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of the part package (Simultaneous Engineering) from the concept phase onward, including early inclusion of the developers of neighboring components.
- Further improvement of the optical and functional characteristics.
- Functionality must be ensured within the requested temperature range.

Mirror Glass.

The mirror glass reflects the rear field of view.

Mirror glass heating:
- The glass heating prevents the reflecting surface from frosting or humidity and ensures clear visibility of the legally required field of view.
- Activation of the heating is through the door control panel.
- Glass heating is required on both the driver and passenger sides.

Mirror Glass Adjustment.

Mirror glass adjustment enables the driver to rotate the reflecting surface around a virtual point, providing the possibility to move the field of view horizontally and vertically.
- The glass adjustment is controlled exclusively electrically.
- Activation of the adjustment is through the door control panel.
</page>

<page number="14">
The glass adjustment is required on both sides (driver/passenger).

### Side turn indicator:
The side turn indicator serves as an additional driving direction signal integrated into the mirror head. Activation is through the XY control panel. The side turn indicator is required on both sides (driver/passenger).

### Mirror folding:
Mirror folding enables the rotation of the mirror head around a defined axis relative to the mirror foot, which is fixed to the car body. The folding function is activated electrically through the door control panel, and manual folding is required to meet legal requirements. Mirror folding is required on both sides (driver/passenger).

### Stiffness / Rigidity / Stability of Shape:
The option for electric mirror folding shall consider the necessary rigidity.  

- Rigidity of the upper tip of the base cover must prevent upturning (e.g., wash brush). Specific details will be clarified with VinFast, including GID, pretension, and reinforcement ribs.
- High-gloss variants must define appropriate measures against sink marks.
- The mirror triangle sealing to the window guide must ensure sufficient stiffness, even at maximum vehicle speed.  
- Design elements, especially brackets and operating components, must ensure no noticeable instability.  
- During stiffness and rigidity testing, permanent deformation, breakage, or customer-relevant modifications are unacceptable.  
- Elastic deformation must not impact surrounding parts, such as the quarter window or side panel, causing vehicle leakage.  
- All edges or burs must be deburred and brush-finished for safety.  
- Modules design and material selection must ensure secure fixing and avoid visible defects across the entire operational temperature range.  
- Gaskets and seals must perform effectively under unfavorable tolerance situations.  
- Component designs shall be optimized using FEM calculation.  
- Full interior leak tightness must be ensured for the complete lifecycle of the vehicle.

### Product Characteristics:
- Optical appearance must align with styling specifications, including shape, surfaces, and design elements like cuttings and edges.
- Modules should meet legal and standard requirements and adhere to product drawings and design documents.  
- Components must account for tolerances of assemblies, including thermal elongation.  
- If any tolerance is missing, suppliers must request these from VinFast.  
- Tolerance analyses shall be submitted to the relevant development departments or individuals.  
- Designs must avoid noise due to component functionality or unfavorable tolerances in joints.  
- Systems must allow easy mounting without injury risk and enable damage-free removal and reinstallation.
</page>

<page number="15">
Material, surface and shape of the individual components must not impair the function of adjoining components, including the process-related tolerances of the complete modules and the body-in-white independence of tolerances or thermal elongation. The used material should not cause any corrosion problems. During the stiffness and rigidity testing, there must not be any permanent deformations, no breakage, and no customer-relevant modifications. Safety of function under all loads stated in drawings, test specifications, quality specifications, and texts of laws must be ensured.

The fixations to the vehicles have to be developed to exclude the detachment of the component in case of a vehicle crash, preventing injury to vehicle occupants and surrounding persons. Components cannot be displaced or dismounted unintentionally. Proof must be given that the respective legal requirements have been met. All components must remain functional over the whole temperature range.

**Interfaces**

The components must be designed to guarantee the function and gap definitions in combination with adjacent systems. Interfaces must be developed in coordination with VinFast and by using a quality methodology such as FMEA. Inhomogeneous thermal elongation of adjacent parts must be accounted for to maintain the required gap and step configuration.

If various materials, such as metallic ones, are used, appropriate measures must be taken to prevent contact corrosion. A system must be developed that is easily mountable without the risk of injury, facilitating removal and re-mounting without damage to the components or neighboring parts. Neighboring components should also not suffer damage when removed correctly. Proper fit of the parts must be ensured, even with unfavorable tolerances of components or surroundings.

It must be guaranteed that components cannot be displaced or unintentionally removed.

**Relevant module interfaces:**

- Mechanical interfaces:
  - Door Panel
  - Door Trim Delta Cover
  - Door Glass

- Electrical interfaces:
  - Design representation suitable for manufacturing
  - Compatibility to the vehicle electronics

Adjustment reliability must be maintained from +90°C to -35°C, referred to in VF technical specifications (VFDST00009600 Technical specifications; Release, changes).

NVH and Driving Comfort – Complete Vehicle

**General:**  
The VINFAST target system for the Outer Rear View Mirror is oriented on VinFast reference vehicles. The system must not cause any kind of disturbing sound (relative movement, squeak, and rattle, temperature, flexural torsion, etc.) during any operation. All possible appropriate measures must be taken to prevent operating noises completely or absorb/deaden them to the greatest extent possible to achieve acceptable noises.  

Squeak and rattle (S&R) effects, which may occur during high-speed driving, particularly at certain humidity levels, must be avoided through suitable profile design and by choosing a high-quality surface coating and material pairing. NVH team assistance may be sought to select appropriate material pairing to avoid buzzing, squeak, and rattle noises.  

Evidence of noise disturbance freedom must be coordinated with the responsible VinFast NVH-testing team.  

**The supplier must guarantee:**  
- No noticeable vibrations of the Outer Rear View Mirror that would cause blurry mirror images.  
- Avoidance of noise caused by components' function or joints due to unfavorable tolerances.  
- No squeak or rattle noise caused by movement of the Outer Rear View Mirror during any driving load case.  
- Fulfillment of all functions over the whole operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).

**Weight Management:**  
Minimizing vehicle weight is a major goal since it significantly influences energy consumption. All system components must be designed with weight optimization in mind throughout development. Weight reduction potentials and their impacts on cost, timing, and quality must be demonstrated by the supplier.  

The entire system must not exceed a weight target of 2.1 kg for the CUV version.  

---

**In-Vehicle Thermal & Thermal Comfort:**  
Integration of heated features and electrical connections must be considered in module design.  

---

**Electrical Systems & Functions:**  
The architecture and electrical system must fulfill the standards mentioned in VFDST00009600 Technical Specifications: Release and changes.

Test plan:
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in a good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly or if new data/information due to development changes is needed. 

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of his component has the SDS. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The SDS has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend at any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VinFast/SDS.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or a different testing procedure, the testing has to be redone at the expense of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned, and the retesting has to be paid by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in the form of a project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by VF testing department. The initial data filling has to be done by the SDS and submitted to VF (at least 4 weeks after the nomination of the SDS).

The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.
</page>

<page number="19">
The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department (VinFast), SQA (VinFast) and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule. Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.

### Testing

VinFast "Logistics" determines the number of sample parts, VinFast "Purchase" orders the parts.

A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

Development parts or partial body structures which are necessary for testing at the SDS must in any case be stated in the quotation of the SDS and must be ordered from VinFast by the SDS.

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS.
</page>

<page number="20">
CAD data models in compliance with VinFast requirements must be provided in time for virtual sample manufacturing.

In order to coordinate the form and the surface, corresponding samples have to be presented by the SDS at the corresponding approval offices at VF with Cubing report and Appearance Approval report (see VF Standard Color Matching / Appearance Approval VFDST00038400).

The SDS must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any problems (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the SDS must submit a test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions to keep all milestones and observe all targets. 

An "OK" or "NOK" result needs to be stated on the first sheet of the report.

### Analyses and Test Reports
- The SDS has to provide measurement reports (VFDST00008900) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during the prototype generations. 
- After individual tests, the test samples have to be analyzed in detail. 
- The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report must be handed over to the responsible VF department for release. 
- Upon request, the results together with the documentation of the tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development) are to be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests carried out parallel to series production are to be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.

5.2 General CAE Requirements

CAE-FEM-GENERAL  
03.VFCAE-001-FEM-GENERAL-VER0.1.docx.

5.3 Material Requirements & Corrosion

Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes also fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).

- Avoid water and dirt accumulation; always provide drainage in the lowest positions.
- Avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements.
- Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.
- **Edge Coverage:** Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

  - ≤ 10%  

- *Weld seam corrosion:*  
  - ≤ 5%  

- *Degree of rusting:*  
  - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).  

**Stainless steel:**  
Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion), in most cases an insulating coating is needed.  

**Test criteria for high visible parts:**  
720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check especially areas with crevices.
</page>

<page number="25">
Execute component tests with assembled sub-systems, where possible, and in positions as installed on the vehicle.

**Aluminium parts:**
Aluminium parts in high visible areas must be painted or anodized.
- **Test criteria Painted Aluminium:** See test criteria for organic coatings.
- **Test criteria Anodized Aluminium:** 480h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.
  
**Chromed metal parts:**
- 240h NSS ISO9227 without base material corrosion.

**Chromed plastic parts:**
- **CASS-Test:** According to DIN EN ISO 9227; duration:
  - 48h for Exterior.
  - 24h for Interior.
- **Acceptance criteria:** No surface defects.
- Additionally: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.

**Electric parts:**
- Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations.
- Material combinations must be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.
- Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatments on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials.
- The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.
- **Terminals and connectors:** Do not place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection for terminals requires tightness; electrical connections must be protected from humidity.
- **Groundings:** Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.
- **Aluminium/sealing surfaces:** Aluminium alloys with copper and iron contents exceeding 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal quickly, allowing moisture to enter the component.

**Prevention of stone chipping issues:**
(Additional requirements or details regarding stone chipping are omitted in the provided text.)
</page>

<page number="26">
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:
- Provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts whenever possible.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.
- Choose part materials and paint with the same colour in high stone hitting risk areas to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle, deepen them so they cannot be hit easily by stones.

### 5.4 Traceability
For part requirements, follow the specification as defined in VinFast standards VFDST00010502 and VFDST00010501.

### 5.5 Labeling of Parts

#### Styling Technique Convergence
- Changes to parts and modules affecting exterior and/or interior styling surfaces must be immediately communicated to VinFast for evaluation.
- Part or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops must be provided by the supplier based on defined requirements from VinFast module leads. This information can include tooling demands, assembly sequences, office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.

#### Ergonomics
- The complete vehicle must pass the ergonomic test based on VinFast's internal procedures.
- All dimensional and material changes affecting ergonomics on parts and modules must be communicated to VinFast for evaluation.
- The main ergonomic targets, such as ingress/egress, seating layout, armrest positions, steering wheel position, and roominess definition, derive from benchmark analysis based on defined benchmark vehicles.
</page>

<page number="27">
The final sign-off of all ergonomic targets will be done in close cooperation with VinFast, which is responsible for interior and exterior styling. VinFast ultimately approves targets by evaluations using the styling bucks.

### 5.7 Vehicle Safety  
**Cooperation with VinFast vehicle safety department.**  
The supplier is responsible for supporting the integration of vehicle safety functions actively. Lifetime-relevant laws and ratings of selling markets, as well as OEM requirements, must be taken into account.

Material data sheets have to be provided by the supplier to VinFast IMDS-ID 214435.

Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations, which have been defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<).

Material safety data sheets (SDS) according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (incl. national chemical inventory 2017) have to be provided to VinFast for milestone concept confirmation. Consider local rules for SDS creation and UN-guidelines acc. GHS Globally Harmonized System of Classification, Labelling, and Packaging of Chemicals.

Recycling.

Recycled materials.
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’). Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g. recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert’s team at VinFast.

Recycling scheme.
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements for the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.

6.2 Environmental Compatibility.  
The supplier is required to develop products that minimize environmental impacts throughout their life cycle. Key measures include using recyclable materials, recycled and renewable resources, reducing hazardous substances, minimizing emissions and resource consumption, and implementing waste prevention strategies.

- **Drainage scheme**: Drainage protocols must ensure safe removal of fluids, avoiding environmental retention.
