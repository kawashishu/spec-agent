---

#### 3.5 Corrosion Requirement.

To determine corrosion requirements, the system's corrosivity position must be classified for each component within the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

3. **High corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very high corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally classified as an area of high corrosivity.

**Material combination requirements:**  
- Select combinations to avoid galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and attached brackets.  
- For critical material combinations, apply proper coatings (e.g., paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers).  

**Design considerations:**  
- Provide drainage in lowest positions to avoid water and dirt accumulation.  
- Prevent dirt traps that may damage painted surfaces and micro-movements.  
- Design contact surfaces large enough to ensure low pressure, made of non-abrasive materials, and minimize micro-movement.  
- Ensure burr-free edges and use a paint system with good edge coverage.

**Corrosion testing:**  
- Components must pass system/component corrosion tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests.  

**Metallic components:**  
- **Salt spray test:** ISO9227.  
- Acceptance criteria to be determined during testing phases.

### Chromed Plastic Parts
- **Test:** CASS-Test according to DIN EN ISO 9227.  
- **Durations:**  
  - Exterior: 48h.  
  - Interior: 24h.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Surface defects: None.  
  - NSS Test: 240h NSS ISO 9227 without surface defects.  

### Electric Parts
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as various control units, shall be ventilated using a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (e.g., type Gortex) when placed in wet locations.  

#### Material Combinations
- Material combinations must prevent galvanic corrosion. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.  
- Direct contact with noble metals such as steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, conductive or anti-static rubber should be avoided in wet environments.  
- Surface treatment on steel fasteners is required for long-term corrosion resistance and material compatibility.  

#### Installation Guidelines
- Vibrations must not generate fretting corrosion in electrical components installations.  
- **Terminals:** Do not place them at the lowest points; ensure they are protected from humidity.  
- **Groundings:** Water-tight connecting surfaces are mandatory when placed in corrosive environments.  

#### Aluminium/Sealing Surfaces
- Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content greater than 1% must be avoided for components with sealing surfaces.  
- **Reason:** Such alloys are highly prone to corrosion penetration, leading to seal failure and moisture entry.  

### Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues
To minimize damage to the bodywork and components due to stone chipping, design measures include:  
- Adding shielding parts to protect vulnerable areas.  
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas to prevent severe impacts.

## 3.6 Traceability
For part requirements, please refer to VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

## 3.7 Labeling of Parts
Suppliers shall follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. The supplier needs to make figures for positioning labels on parts (position labels set-up with pictures).

## 3.8 Testing and Validation and DVP&R
DVP and PC test responsibilities follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for system, sub-system, and component levels must align with the Complete Vehicle Specification book in the concept phase. Detailed test plans for hardware tests must be included in the file DVP&R, and suppliers need to work with the Testing & Validation department.

### Testing Instructions:
- Testing must include the declaration of standards, norms, or legal requirements.
- Describe the testing setup, including devices used (provide pictures).
- Indicate where testing was performed (internal/external).
- Specify the duration and time flow of the testing (using a project plan).
- Provide part variants and descriptions of parts.
- Include the number of tested components/parts.

Ensure the Mileage Target Life is 160,000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first).

### DVP for the Component:
Refer to VFSRXXBEX1408-DVP (VFSRXXBEX1408_Logo_projector_DVP_20211026.xlsx). VinFast prefers using off-the-shelf supplier lamps with some modifications. Supplier-conducted tests that are still valid need not be repeated.

### 3.8.1 Test Plan
The test plan regulates:
- By whom and when the testing shall be performed.
- The testing devices required.
- Progress results in a visually clear format.

The test plan must ensure consistent tracking of results. If VinFast requires verification of results, the supplier must deliver the necessary parts free of charge.

The test procedures and documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and the component lead engineer at VinFast.
</page>

<page number="15">
The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of his component has the FSS SUP. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on a committed schedule. The FSS SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend at any testing at the FSS SUP site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VinFast/FSS SUP.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the cost of FSS SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting has to be paid for by FSS SUP if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- No. of tested components/parts.

The FSS SUP is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by VF testing department. The initial data filling has to be done by the FSS SUP and submitted to VF (at least 4 weeks after the nomination of the FSS SUP).

The FSS SUP has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the FSS SUP.

The DVP&R has to be agreed upon between the test department (VF), SQA (VinFast), and the FSS SUP before concept confirmation. After this approval, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the FSS SUP has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, the FSS SUP draws up a test plan for each single component.
