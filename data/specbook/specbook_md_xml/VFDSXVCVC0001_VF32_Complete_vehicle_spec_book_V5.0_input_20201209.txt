The main purpose of this internal specification is to summarize all information available on complete vehicle level. In accordance with the mentioned supplements, it describes the complete vehicle from a technical perspective.  
An important part of this spec book is the derivation of complete vehicle targets, categorized according to the VF Vehicle Integration Team structure. These targets will serve as base for a breakdown of subsystem and component targets which will be documented in component specifications. The Design and Verification Plan outlined in this document will give a brief summary of the verification and validation activities in this project to prove the product’s target fulfillment.

2.2 Language.  
All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

2.3 Obligation of requirement wording.  
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.  

- **Shall**  
  The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.

- **Should**  
  The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.

- **May**  
  The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

### 5.7.5 Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability)

#### 5.7.5.1 Purpose
Guarantee of a consistent design and development philosophy concerning operational strength from the complete vehicle level, over the system level, down to the component level.

Ensuring sufficient operational strength in relation to the intended vehicle-typical use conditions.

Consideration and ensuring of product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile.

Definition of all requirements to ensure sufficient operational strength of the complete vehicle, systems, and components. (This technical specification forms the basis for all system and component technical specifications.)

#### 5.7.5.2 Basic Dimensioning of Complete Vehicle, Systems, and Components

**Operating Loads:**  
Operating loads are the load which occurs during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with benchmark vehicles available on Program VTS - Stiffness, Strength, and Durability Track loads, provided by RLDA according to market standards to develop road regions RLDA data to input to structural durability tests.

The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car. The vehicle test mileage is equivalent to 160,000 kilometers of customer normal driving.

**Special Events:**  
Special events are occurrences of low frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS braking. The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.

### 5.7.5 Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability)

#### 5.7.5.1 Purpose
Guarantee of a consistent design and development philosophy concerning operational strength from the complete vehicle level, over the system level, down to the component level. Ensuring of sufficient operational strength in relation to the intended, vehicle-typical use conditions. Consideration and ensuring of product-typical characteristics, derived from the application profile. Definition of all requirements to ensure a sufficient operational strength of the complete vehicle, systems, and components (this technical specification serves as the basis for all system and component technical specifications).

#### 5.7.5.2 Basic Dimensioning of Complete Vehicle, Systems, and Components
- **Operating loads:** These loads occur during the intended use of the vehicle and are derived from benchmark vehicles available on Program VTS - Stiffness, Strength, and Durability Track loads. Road Regions RLDA Data is used as input for Structural Durability Tests.
  - The tested mileage equals 160,000 kilometers of customer normal driving.
  - **Special events:** Occurrences like ABS braking (<100 frequency) are considered. Special events should not affect functionality, damage safety-relevant components, or reduce service life.

#### 5.7.5.3 Operational Strength Relevant in Vehicle Testing
Testing must adhere to VinFast standards:
- **Vehicle Durability Testing:**
  - Mileage Target Life: 160,000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first).
  - Structural Durability Test: RLDA-derived inputs are used with Road Simulator MTS 329 to simulate total damage over vehicle life.
  - General Durability Test: Conducted at Proving Ground, in-market correlation is introduced with RLDA Data to assess operational strength. Reliability validation is aligned with customer targets over 160,000 km.
- **Powertrain Durability:**
  - Focused on engine and transmission durability over accelerating, decelerating cycles, high-speed cycles, and reverse gear procedures.
  - Inspections are carried out at the beginning, after 25%, 50%, 75%, and at the end of testing to evaluate deterioration accurately.

#### 5.7.5.4 Project-Specific Targets Concerning Operational Strength
Targets concerning operational strength are outlined in project-specific catalogs:
1. Complete vehicle level.
2. Module/system level.
3. Component level.

### 5.7.6 Weight Management
The weight target is based on VinFast's vision and the customer market profile. The major goal of weight management is to minimize vehicle weight to influence energy consumption positively. Throughout development, all components must be designed with weight optimization as a priority.

### Misuse Events
Misuse events are incidents not included in intended vehicle use (e.g., curbstone impact). Vehicles must be designed to:
- Ensure damage is clearly recognizable (e.g., steering or wheel alignment issues).
- Maintain a defined damage chain post-misuse for ease of replacement.
- Allow cracks or damages to occur only with recognizable plastic deformations at components.

---
**Testing Summary:**
Mileage Target: 160,000 km or 10 years. Vehicle tests involve RLDA correlation, road simulation, proving grounds, and inspections for strength/weight optimization.

**Misuse Evaluation:** Ensures usability with identifiable damages and controlled deformations in unintended use scenarios.

This ensures quick heat-up of the entire passenger compartment. Together with other outlets, this provides steady-state climate comfort for all passengers.

**Defrost Outlets.**
The defrost outlets must direct heated air to the windscreen and at least to the front side screens. This ensures that a large area of the screens can be defrosted or demisted fast and reliably. Screens should steadily remain free of mist without creating a disturbing sensible airflow. Governmental requirements for defrost and demist (Regulation (EU) No 672/2010 for ICE and (EU) No 672/2010 for BEV) must be fulfilled. Screens that are demisted once should not get misted again under normal driving conditions. All screens must remain free of mist during vehicle use.

5.7.12.3 Absence of Air Draught for Good Coziness (Climate Comfort).

All driving conditions and ambient climate situations typical for the intended market area must be covered by climate comfort tests. During such tests, it must be possible to easily adjust the HVAC system to reach at first attempt the AI (assessment index) “NEUTRAL” (+/-1) for coziness. Adjustments to clothing must suffice to reach “NEUTRAL.” 

The temperature stratification in the passenger compartment must align with given tolerances. Assessment has to fall within development targets, aside from minor deviations in extreme climate regions.

The absence of air draught and coziness assessments must be performed by a nominated assessment team under all climatic conditions, under control of the HVAC system.

5.7.12.4 Passenger Compartment Air Pressure, Vehicle Tightness.

Fresh air intake and rear air extraction must be designed and positioned appropriately to minimize sensible air pressure changes in the passenger compartment. All HVAC system functions and geometry must ensure adequate air pressure in the compartment.

Air pressure in the passenger compartment must maintain only slight and non-disturbing pressure changes when driving with windows closed at any vehicle/wind speed or in any HVAC mode. Similarly, pressure differences must remain non-disturbing when closing doors or the trunk lid/tailgate or with the vehicle parked.

Doors, trunk lid, and tailgate must close freely—without resistance or swing—without causing sensible pressure peaks in the passenger compartment.

Running the HVAC system in fresh air mode must limit deviation in climatisation air due to vehicle speed changes to a non-disturbing minimum.

Changes to HVAC settings must avoid disturbing pressure fluctuations.

The passenger compartment must maintain sufficient tightness to ensure climate stability and minimize HVAC system power consumption.
</page>

<page number="34">
### Specification:
Air pressure in the passenger compartment must increase at least by dp=125Pa at a fresh air amount of 100SCFM delivered by the HVAC system and while rear air extractors are closed tightly. Verification of a sufficient cross section equivalent of the rear air extraction when checking the tightness of the car body.

**Remark:**  
The air pressure drop characteristics throughout the entire vehicle (all relevant components, the entire air path with special attention to the rear air extraction) has to be tuned carefully to reach the specifications.  

### 5.7.12.5 Recirculation Air and Rear Air Extraction  
To achieve the required coziness and the necessary easy and exact HVAC system adjustability, a symmetrical (left to right side) distribution of the amounts of air to be extracted from the passenger compartment or to be exhausted by the rear extractors has to be provided. The air passages in the footwell insulation panel (for recirculation air) and in the rear panels and interior parts (for extracted air) have to be tuned carefully without sensibly increasing the pressure drop along these air paths.  

**Assessment:**  
The assessments will consider all driving and climatic conditions by assessing temperature distribution and passenger compartment climate comfort.  

### 5.7.12.6 Mass Flow and Distribution of Conditioned Air  
Mass flow is mostly depending on the HVAC.  

### 5.7.12.7 Temperature Distribution at Air Outlets  
The required quality of the HVAC control is only achievable with an HVAC system delivering the required heating or cooling power of the air always with the correct temperature and mass flow distribution corresponding to the individual setting and situation in an exactly reproducible manner.  

**Temperature Control Characteristics:**  
Under steady state driving conditions (road load), the temperatures at the corresponding outlets must follow the temperatures set by the control unit with very little deviation regardless of the direction of approach to the new setting.  

**Temperature Stratification:**  
A stable coziness in steady state condition has to be ensured by concerted temperature differences between the heat area and footwell area. The HVAC system will not include a stratification function with a button.  

### 5.7.12.8 Refrigerant Circuit  
The required output of the refrigerant circuit must be achievable in a stable, optimized, cost-efficient, and fuel-efficient manner. The following tests and measurements will be performed to evaluate this goal:  
- Determination of the optimal charge of refrigerant  
- Passive heat-up
</page>

<page number="35">
o Maximum cool down.
o Operating reliability under extreme ambient and operating conditions.
o Adjustment of the blower speed characteristics.
o Cooling air flow through the condenser.
o Determination of the optimum charge of lubricant.
o Evaluation of the appropriate position of the dryer/filter bottle and the charge air cooler.
o Establishment of the climate compressor torque consumption characteristics.

**Determination of the optimal charge of refrigerant.**  
The optimal charge ensures a proper effect of the refrigerant circuit for as long as possible. This amount of refrigerant is just a little less than the limit of overfill. An overfilling with refrigerant causes a significant increase in the pressure and the peak temperature at the high-pressure side. The limits of the safety devices can be reached, and an A/C cut-off will be the consequence.

**Passive heat up.**  
The vehicle must not suffer from too high temperatures in the passenger compartment even when parked in hot ambient conditions and at high solar radiation. This passive heat-up inside the passenger compartment has to be minimized to an acceptable level by appropriate heat insulation of the roof and solar radiation protection of the screens by optimized geometry (sizes and angles) and thermal properties of the glass.

**Maximum cool down.**  
Passengers should get convenient cooling as fast as possible after the start of the vehicle when heated up in the sun. To demonstrate the cooling capacity of the system, the passenger compartment must be cooled immediately by sufficient air of corresponding low temperature.

**Operation reliability under extreme ambient and operation conditions.**  
Even with extreme hot ambient temperatures, the A/C system has to show sufficient cooling function.

**Adjustment of the blower speed characteristics.**  
Good system efficiency requires sufficient cooling air drawn through the condenser, which is only possible with optimized cooling fan speed characteristics.

**Cooling air flow through the condenser.**  
The HVAC system efficiency has to be ensured by uniform supply of cool fresh air to the whole surface of the condenser.

**Determination of the optimum charge of lubricant.**  
The supplier of the A/C compressor shall establish the necessary amount of lubricant. The lubrication of the compressor has to be ensured under all operating conditions. During pretesting, a lubricant fill according to the supplier’s suggestion shall be used.

6 Complete Vehicle Testing, DVP  
The testing phase is structured in these phases:  
- Mule Generation  
- EP  
- PTO  
- PP  

The Mule vehicle testing focus will be on chassis, powertrain, and thermal system tests, as well as load spectrum measurements for BIW durability evaluations. Besides testing drivable vehicles, partial build-ups will be produced to serve vehicle structure validation needs.  

Tests for ensuring target fulfillment will be carried out using complete vehicles of the PPV. Powertrain and thermal test bench testing are also the responsibility of VF.  

System and component tests are the responsibility of suppliers, including their sub-contractor’s tests.  

The complete Design and Verification Plan (DVP) regarding all complete vehicle functions is shown in DVP appendix 4:

7 Reporting and documentation.

7.1 Information Exchange.
In order to reduce emails and enable a proper communication process, VF set up a data exchange server for the exchange of documents, e.g., meeting minutes, work reports, planning documentation, testing documentation, styling feedback, specifications, etc. CAD data shall be exchanged via Teamcenter or Supplier collaboration.

7.2 Documentation and Archiving Obligations.
Description without archiving obligation description.

7.3 Priority and Up-to-Datedness of documents.
This document focuses on the description of the complete vehicle functions and performance. Details with regard to design can be found in CAD data or further applicable documents.

Generally, in case of contradictory statements in specifications or other documents, the released drawings have higher priority. Discrepancies have to be clarified immediately upon occurrence and documented appropriately to ensure a stable clarification.

8. National and international norms and standards (DIN, EN, ISO, etc.) which will be quoted with further applicable documents.

7.4 Change documentation and Part History documentation.  
VF has set up criteria and a change management process (see also Chapter 2.8) to enable efficient handling/documentation/confirmation of changes of the involved parties (VinFast/Suppliers Tier 1-x). The goal is to evaluate each change request’s impact on product- and program targets, quality, timing, and product cost.  
Suppliers are required to collaborate within this change management process throughout the concept and serial development phase. Specifically, suppliers have to implement confirmed changes and shall confirm Supplier in written notice about any impact on the project/program within 3 weeks.  
Furthermore, suppliers have to provide data in a format defined by Supplier to ensure proper documentation of changes in the course of the development and, if applicable, production processes (e.g., entries in a project manual).  
Change requests that are caused within a supplier’s development scope and have an impact on the project/program with regard to cost, timing, and quality will be handled by the claim management. Such change requests can be confirmed only by purchasing.  

7.5 Vehicle documentation.  
All complete vehicle buildups will be documented using the PRODAP system (PRODuction Applications Platform).  
This database will include a vehicle-specific documentation of:
1. Actual build condition.  
2. Variable product data, e.g., engine serial number, gearbox serial number, etc.  
3. Checklists for all relevant screw torques.  
4. Executed rework.  
5. Reporting of all gathered data.  

In general, systems or parts which have to fulfill safety regulations of VinFast or legal requirements have to get a remark on the drawing. VF will provide a document which lists the reasons and the characteristics which have to be documented.

7.6 Traceability.  
All parts delivered to the customer have to be clearly traceable by proper identification marking if they are relevant for declared traceability.  
A clear concept for traceability will be implemented by VF and has to be supported by the suppliers.  
The marking parts follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010 Marking of parts and VFDST00010501 DMC labeling.

8 Design for manufacturing and assembly.  
The project’s goal is to maximize the number of off-the-shelf parts. Additionally, as many parts as possible should be designed in a way that they can be used for the assembly VF32.  
Please see VinFast “Manufacturing Statement of Requirements” for further details.
