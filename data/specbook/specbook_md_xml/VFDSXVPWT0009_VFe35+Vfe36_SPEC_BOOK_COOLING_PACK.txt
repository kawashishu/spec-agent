**3.1.2 Function**  
The cooling module is a functional subsystem designed to meet thermal management requirements. Each component should be verified according to:  

- **Fan**: Sufficient airflow should be provided at all driving conditions to support radiator heat exchange requirements.  
- **Radiator**: Sufficient heat rate to air/from coolant while keeping coolant temperature after the radiator below 60°C. Coolant is composed of 50:50 water and a long-life antifreeze.  

A general requirement is that the air pressure drop should be as low as possible for all heat exchangers to enable a large airflow, minimize fan power, and maintain a low fan discharge temperature.  

It is important to note that the program's intention is to provide only a lower grill to support cooling performance. A generic requirement for the grill opening has been agreed upon between teams to best support cooling performance. The cooling module supplier is intended to develop the system based on this requirement.  

**3.1.3 System Requirements**  
System suppliers must define characteristic curves and values matching thermal requirements from EDS, battery, and high voltage components.  

The fan design provides a multi-speed controlled fan in performance. A control signal is provided by the vehicle, and final versions will be defined during development work.  

The following requirements must be fulfilled:  

- Airflow requirements based on component temperatures and vehicle usage profiles (media and component cooling specified for all departments, locations, and seasons of use).  
- Geometry.  
- Electrical power consumption (efficiency).  
- Charge balance compatibility.  
- Acoustics, vibrations, and resonances.  
- Life expectancy according to the operational profile.  
- Serviceability and ease of repair.  

Suppliers are responsible for complete system development and covering all development phases to ensure system performance requirements are met. The following development activities should be led by suppliers:  

- **Concept creation for the system**.  
- **Cooling module development**.  

**Grill Opening**  
The grill opening projected area should cover more than 15% of the cooling module area.

**3.1.3 System Requirements**

- Package refinement  
- Sizing of heat exchangers  
- Evaluation of air flow distribution  
- Prediction of heat exchanger cooling air mass flows  
- Identification of leakage paths  
- Evaluation of pressure loss of the cooling module  
- Evaluation of airflow uniformity  
- 3D simulation of the cooling module  
- 1D simulation of the cooling module  
- Provides flow rate data, used as a boundary condition for the cooling system simulation  

**Supported by supplier:**

- On-vehicle 3D simulation  
- Optimization of grille openings  
- Balance of cooling airflow requirements with front-end parts such as bumper beam, license plate, etc  
- Balance of aerodynamic performance with cooling airflows  
- Powertrain cooling system optimization  
- Facilitation of system differences between markets  
- Sizing of coolant loop components such as pump  

**3.1.3.1 Radiator Requirements:**

| **Ambient**       | **Heat Exchange Requirement** | **Air Pressure Drop** | **Coolant Pressure Drop** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Radiator Battery** | 9-11 kW                      | 80 Pa                  | 18 kPa                   |
| **Radiator for EDS** | 12-16 kW                     | 80 Pa                  | 18 kPa                   |

Supplier shall meet required performance and provide components performance data. Coolant flow for the simulations should be assumed to 20-30 liters/min.  

The radiator size should be determined by thermal requirements; however, from a packaging point of view, it is beneficial if all heat exchangers in the cooling module have the same width.  

Preferred radiator designs are I-flow radiators, although U-flow radiators are also acceptable. Radiators must be equipped with POPP clamp connections. For low-temperature radiators, these connections should comply with DIN 3021-A XX, length 25 mm. Other alternatives may be considered if requested by the supplier.

**Characteristic Curves:**

Inner flow rate vs. pressure drop.  

| **Inner Flow Rate (m³/s)** | **Pressure Loss (Pa)** | **Inside Entry Temp (°C)** | **Inside Exit Temp (°C)** |

Distribution of high temperatures.

Lifetime for the fan module is 10,000h. Electrical components should be chosen to withstand the temperature profile and lifetime. 

### Requirements for components under the waterline
The cooling fan is located under the waterline and must therefore withstand being underwater during wading without affecting the normal service life.

Parts from driving in deep water test should be analyzed jointly by the supplier and the VinFast team. The component shall have full function during and after the test according to the component specification.

Purging areas must be located above the waterline and/or be equipped with some kind of one-way valve or a Gore-Tex type membrane. The engine compartment and the underside of the car are wet, snowy, and dirty environments.

Water, snow, and dirt must not cause any problem in any system or component during the vehicle service life. Components must withstand water spray and, in some cases, water splash from wheels and being submerged in water during wading.

Use water-tight connectors and, if necessary, protection shields to protect components. Earth and plus connections must be situated in a dry and clean area or withstand water, dirt, and snow. Sensitive parts and electrical connections must be waterproof.

### Balancing
The residual imbalance shall be measured on the complete fan. The unit shall be softly suspended (the suspension elements’ resonant frequency shall be at least 4 times lower than the fan’s speed) or rigidly suspended in equipment that is well insulated from vibrations from surrounding machines.

All rotating parts shall be statically balanced. For fans, residual imbalance according to ISO 1940-1:2003 may not exceed the value stated on the drawing for complete fan and also shown below. With a sufficiently flat fan (fan wheel + motor), static balancing may be carried out on a complete fan system.  

**Static imbalance:** 30 gmm

The max imbalance of the cooling fan should be controlled < 2 g-cm.  

### Corrosion Requirement
As this cooling pack is applicable for US applications, the cooling pack should meet the following requirements for corrosion.

Refer to VFDSXVPWT0109 – VFe35+VFe36_DVP_COOLING_PACK.

3.7 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.
AAR is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing).  

For each step of the process, the supplier is responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design, following agreed timing with VF, to obtain OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  
The process begins in the early phase during PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS.  
Suppliers must include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.  
For EPDM and PA tube lines, AAR is not applicable.
