### Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization
To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, pyrotechnical components must include a central inflation ability using the diagnostic interface/central data interface. Compliance must meet all specified requirements.
</page>

<page number="19">
Enable sequential deployment of all components to avoid noise and pressure peaks, and check deployment per component.

After deployment of pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain. Any residues classified as toxic waste or hazardous substances under valid legislation must result in the dismantling and disposal of components separately as hazardous substances.

A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components must be immediately and clearly visible. This can be indicated acoustically, directly at the vehicle, or via feedback at the deployment tool.

Mark positions of pyrotechnical components, especially hidden components such as battery safety terminal clamps and active safety headrests.

In the event of non-deployment, removal of pyrotechnical components is required. Pre-dismantling should be avoided (technical feasibility must ensure accessibility of fasteners).

### Recycling
#### Recycled Materials
Material selection must prioritize reducing the variety of materials and ensuring compatibility with established recycling technologies. Secondary raw materials, such as recycled polymeric PET fiber, textiles, foams, thermoplastics, etc., must be preferred if readily available. These recycled materials must adhere to parts marking standards as defined in this specification book and be reported to VinFast's environmental compliance team.

#### Recycling Scheme
This section establishes project-wide requirements for recycling and repair schemes during component development. Cost-effective recycling at end-of-life must be enabled through design considerations. The contractor's recycling scheme must provide a clear layout of the recycling process, including preferred recycling partners and cost estimates. Recycling schemes must be submitted to VinFast's environmental experts before the PTO milestone (Production Try-Out).

### Material Requirements & Corrosion
#### Corrosion Requirements Interior:
- Screws, bolts on handles and mirrors.
- Keys.
- Seat belts.
- Trunk area components.
- Seat structure.
</page>

<page number="20">
Invisible structural parts and vehicle tooling considerations are functional requirements. 

General corrosion requirements:
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
3. **High corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very high corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

### Corrosion tests:
The parts must pass system-component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

#### Component tests for Metallic surfaces:
- **Fog test:** ISO 6270 CH, acceptance criteria defined below.
- **Salt spray test:** ISO 9227, acceptance criteria defined below.

#### For Organic coatings:
- **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT):** ISO 11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria defined below.
- **Alternative tests:** Possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test criteria:
| **Area**                | **Corrosivity**            | **Metallic coatings**       | **Organic coatings**        | **Pass criteria**          |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                      | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227      | 96 h → ISO 6270 CH         | No red rust               |
| Exterior                | Medium                   | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227      | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO 11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust         |
| High & not visible for customer; High & visible | High / Very high corrosivity | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO 11997 Cycle B | CCT: See below         |

#### Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:
Specific details will be determined in further documentation and adherence must be demonstrated.

<page number="21">
Rust creep according to ISO4628-8 must meet the following requirements:
- For galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
- For steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1-2 mm.

Blistering:
- Maximum blister size: S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).

Edge corrosion:
- Limit: ≤ 10%.

Weld seam corrosion:
- Limit: ≤ 5%.

Degree of rusting:
- Limit: ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

Interior corrosion considerations:
The interior is generally considered a dry area with low corrosivity. Exceptions include the floor area or areas exposed to wetness, abrasion by shoes, or exposure to drinking juices, which may produce corrosion. When combining different metals, galvanic corrosion must be avoided by coating affected parts.

Painted edges:
Edges, especially painted edges, shall be burr-free to ensure good edge coverage and to avoid wear.

Seat structure:
For uncoated (blank steel) seat structures, new parts must remain corrosion-free. Corrosion-prone areas must remain hidden from customer view, even under extreme seat-rest positions. On invisible areas, test criteria may be relaxed, but visible areas must remain corrosion-free, and full functionality over the product's lifetime must be assured.

Vehicle tooling:
Tooling typically stored in the trunk is subject to low corrosivity exposure. Tool surfaces with wear may experience medium corrosivity.

Related documentation:
Refer to corrosion requirements for electric components.

---

**Test Plan**
The test plan shall govern the organization of testing, including schedules, responsible parties, and necessary testing devices. Results must be visually documented, and ongoing monitoring of test progress must be maintained. Suppliers are required to deliver test parts free of charge for verification purposes if requested by VinFast. 

Test procedures and documentation must be approved by VinFast’s test engineer. Additionally, the test plan must be updated weekly or sooner if development changes necessitate adjustments.

Responsibilities:
The SDS is responsible for ensuring complete component safeguarding, including timely planning for approval or retesting in case of negative test results. VinFast must receive all relevant test protocols/reports and have the option to observe testing procedures conducted at SDS sites or supplier centers. Deviations from approved test procedures must be mutually agreed upon between VinFast and SDS.

Retesting:
Incorrect parts, missing parts, or deviations in test procedures will require retesting at SDS’s expense. Negative test results necessitate re-planning and further retesting, which must also be funded by SDS if they are at fault for the failure.

Required data for inclusion in the DVP&R:

### Virtual Testing  
Suitable calculation methods are to be used and adequately detailed calculation models created for the purpose of securing, verifying, and effectively optimizing the component properties defined in the technical specification, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations. The requirements relating to the mechanical properties of the component, such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, are to be secured by means of FEM calculations.  

The tool-dimensioning for injection molding is to be optimized via corresponding simulations. On request, the operative calculation models that represent the respective development status are to be made available to the requesting technical departments of VinFast for internal calculations and integration work.  

On request from VinFast, the supplier must provide suitable FEM models without any extra cost. The supplier must calculatively document all tests according to the evaluation plan (e.g., FEM) before tool dimensioning. The supplier must prepare FEM models according to VinFast requirements without extra cost.  

### Component Testing  
These are the basic required component tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP, which has to be agreed between VinFast and the SDS, and will be binding:  

- **Climatic Change Test**: According to VFDST00046100 [35].  
   - Runtime about 226 hours, including climatic and high/low-temperature cycle parts.

Basically no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range is allowed. In particular, by the use of materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficient, the behavior has to be kept.

The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.

These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VinFast and the SDS, and will be binding.

If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

### Geometrical Integration

#### General
See General Engineering Requirements for Suppliers.

**RPS (reference position system):** The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. A RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS-system and VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28] according to interior and BIW department.

#### Tolerance Analyses:
Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms.
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.

### Interfaces
The components must be designed such that the function is guaranteed in combination with the adjoining systems.

The interfaces must be worked out in cooperation with VinFast in consideration of a quality method (e.g. FMEA, risk filter).
