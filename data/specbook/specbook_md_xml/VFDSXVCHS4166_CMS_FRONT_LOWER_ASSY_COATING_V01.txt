**4.3 Homologation and safety regulation requirements**

**4.3.1 North America**  
**a. Homologation and safety regulation activities**  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., European, Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) and Canadian motor vehicle safety standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.  

**b. Self-certification and test report(s)**  
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s) or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain of the FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.

The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.
</page>

<page number="11">
(*) Refer Appendix 8 of Manufacturer Handbook.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations.
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The Supplier have a duty to notify VinFast on such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

4.3.2 Europe.

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.  
The Supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.

b. Test report(s) and Certificate(s).  
The supplier is responsible for getting their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests the Supplier to conduct tests as specified in certain of the UN-ECE at authorized technical service(s). The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
VinFast also requests the Supplier provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings to be submitted to the relevant authorities in order to get certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any).  
The Supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations.
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.

- After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.  
The spare parts provided by the supplier must be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period for after-sales spare parts must ensure the lifecycle of the project and requirements as outlined in the General Term and Condition (GTC) after VinFast ends production of the whole vehicle, except as otherwise specified in the SOR.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly is required to provide VinFast's after-sales engineering department with the design, use, and maintenance information of the assembly before OTS. This information includes the BOM table, part structure and function descriptions, fault diagnosis, special maintenance tools, and relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearances, part performance parameters).
