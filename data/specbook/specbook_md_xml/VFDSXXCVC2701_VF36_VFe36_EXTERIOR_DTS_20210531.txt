Comments:
7.2 mm gap request from engineering. Excessive gap and potential NVH issue, need to double check the liftgate swing and do some optimization to reduce the gap value. Gap value must be between 4 mm and 6 mm.

Descriptive Section:
- The gap from the liftgate to the roof or cielo is nominally 7.2 mm with a ±2 mm tolerance range. 
- The step measurement is nominally -1.5 mm with a ±1.5 mm tolerance range. 
- Parallelism assumptions require adjustments within half the tolerance zone.

Figures and Purpose:
- Figures indicate excessive gap values, such as 7.2 mm, raising potential NVH concerns. 
- Optimization is required to align liftgate swing components to achieve a gap between 4 and 6 mm.  
- Key measurements include roof and side body panel intersections.

Alignment 507 Signal lamp and under housing upper.

EXTERIOR INITIAL DTS Outer rear view mirror.

Section: Parallelism and symmetry assumption: half of the tolerance zone.

Comments: Need to check with supplier.

Requirements:
- GAP: Nominal = 0.5, Target = ±0.5.
- STEP, GAP-Parallelism, FLUSH-Parallelism, Alignment: No specific nominal or target values provided.

Section Description:
The section illustrates the connection between the signal lamp and the under housing upper. Measurements indicate a nominal gap of 0.5 with a tolerance of ±0.5.

Alignment 508 Camera 360 and Housing.

EXTERIOR INITIAL DTS Outer Rear View Mirror.

Section: Parallelism and symmetry assumption: half of the tolerance zone.

Comments: Need to check if seal exists for waterproofing.

Req.Target:
- Nominal: 0.3
- Target: ±0.2

Tolerance Calculation:
- GAP: 0.3 ±0.2
- STEP: No values defined.
- GAP-Parallelism: No values defined.
- FLUSH-Parallelism: No values defined.
- Alignment: No values defined.

Technical Details:
- Housing and camera 360 have a specified gap of 0.3mm with a tolerance of ±0.2mm.

Figure Description:
The diagram shows the 360-degree camera mounted in the housing of the outer rearview mirror assembly. The schematic highlights the necessary gap tolerance between the housing and the camera component for alignment and functionality. 

Parallelism and symmetry are assumed to be distributed evenly within half of the tolerance zone. The nominal design gap ensures proper integration and likely prevents water ingress, subject to verification of seal presence.
