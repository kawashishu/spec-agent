The aim of the assignment is to have a validated Expansion tank for BEV variants that support E-motor cooling, power electronics, HVAC, and battery thermal requirements.

**Image Description:**  
The Expansion tank is designed to meet the cooling and thermal management needs of various BEV components including motors, electronics, HVAC, and batteries. This component ensures reliable performance across multiple vehicle configurations like VF32 and VF33.
</page>

<page number="7">
3.2.1 System description.  

Expansion tank for use with the cooling system, said Expansion tank including an upper member and a lower member both made of a plastic material and adapted to be fixedly connected to each other to form a unitary tank having a coolant-receiving chamber and a coolant supply chamber.  

The objective is to minimize the complexity and high commonality.  

The system designer has to coordinate all components of the module in relation to Packaging, Function, Fixing, and tolerances.  

**BEV Coolant Circuit:**  

The minimum coolant level in the Expansion tank must be located at the topmost of the system for the circuit to work in the most effective manner. The Expansion tank must also provide enough expansion volume to prevent the loss of coolant when the coolant expands either due to increase in temperature or due to vaporization after shutdown.
</page>

<page number="8">
Dimensions are defined based on ICE and BEV applications. The objective is to provide the most compact and cost-effective design while maintaining acceptable quality. Suppliers are responsible for confirming the most cost-effective alternatives for each variant.

Single Expansion tank with different caps has been defined to support the following vehicle programs:

1. **BEV application**:
   - The temperature of the coolant in the BEV E-drive and heating loops may range between -30°C and 95°C.
   - Normal working temperature should remain below 90°C.
   - Pressure may vary from -10 kPa to 50 kPa overpressure.

Cooling Expansion tank geometry:
   - Shall remain within CAD model boundaries, with minor deviations accepted.
   - Must be self-contained (parts assembled within each other).
   - Should provide three mounting points (exact location to be confirmed).
   - Supplier must indicate the most cost-effective approach for supporting both ICE and BEV tank applications.

**Expansion tank specifications**:
   - Geometry should allow compatibility with filling guns and off-the-shelf caps.
   - Caps for both applications will vary:
       - Pressure release valve limit for ICE tank: **1.5 bar**.
       - Pressure release valve limit for BEV tank: **0.50 bar**.
   - Expansion tanks should integrate a level sensor as an embedded component.

**BEV Expansion Neck Dimensions**:
The provided diagram outlines key measurements for the BEV Expansion neck component. The critical dimensions include:
   - Diameter of various parts (e.g., 52, 48, 36.9 mm).
   - Neck depth specifics (e.g., 18.3 and 37 mm).

**Coolant filling gun**:
The expansion tank geometry must ensure compatibility with standard coolant filling systems to optimize usability.
</page>

<page number="9">
### 3.2.2 Function

The Expansion tank is part of a pressurized cooling system designed to push air bubbles up and move out of the system. The Expansion system provides a volume for expansion of the coolant as it is heated, as well as a means of de-aerating the coolant pressurized closed circuit. Pressure Cap is used to maintain pressure in the system. The Expansion tank is a functional subsystem designed to meet thermal management requirements. Each component should be verified according to the following:

- The minimum coolant level in the Expansion tank must be located at the topmost point of the system for the circuit to work in the most effective manner.
- Expansion port should be located on the top side of the tank, and the output port will be at the bottom side of the tank.
- The Expansion tank must also provide enough expansion volume to prevent loss of coolant when the coolant expands, either due to an increase in temperature or due to vaporization after shutdown.
- To determine the expansion caused by an increase in temperature of the coolant, a minimum of 2.3 liters of total Expansion tank volume should be assumed.
- The size and design of the reservoir should limit the flow rate and prevent aeration or air entry into the system.
</page>

<page number="10">
3.2.3 System requirements.  
As general experience on ICE applications, one expansion tank is used, but more than one can be used as per requirement. This is only a general interpretation of the layout that the cooling module supplier must confirm.  

The following requirements have to be fulfilled:  
- Geometry.  
- Acoustics, vibrations, resonances.  
- Life due to the operational profile.  
- Service and ease of repair.  

The supplier is responsible for the expansion tank development and needs to cover all development phases to ensure system performance requirements are met. Following development activities should be led by the supplier:  
- Concept creation system.  
- Package refinement.  
- Sizing of expansion tank.  
- Evaluation of coolant flow distribution.  
- Identification of leakage paths.  
- Evaluation of pressure loss in the cooling module.  
- Evaluation of coolant flow uniformity.  
  Provides flow rate data, used as a boundary condition for the cooling system simulation.  

3.2.4 Interfaces.  
The components must be designed in a way that functionality is guaranteed in combination with all the adjoining systems and interfaces.  

Below is an overview of major interface points:  
- Coolant lines and pump.  
- BIW (clearances, packaging, resonances, stiffness).  
- Engine.  
- E-motor assembly and battery.  
- Chassis (clearances to chassis components, e.g., fuel system, braking system, piping, etc.).  
- Complete vehicle performance targets.  
- Electrical connection.  

The system is subject to ambient temperature variations, from -30°C to 100°C, and corrosive environments. The system is also expected to withstand all types of road load conditions, moderate violence caused during reckless driving on poor roads, or even under off-road conditions.  

The most important interfaces are the tank fixation points, with two top and two bottom pins fixation strategy. These interfaces influence the cooling module position and clearances with its surroundings as well as the NVH insulation placement between the FEM and the cooling module. The interfaces in between should be more of a supportive character to improve durability, static and dynamic behavior, and tolerances stack-up.

IMDS material data sheets must be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID according to the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and VFDST00007601. Specific targets on vehicle indoor air quality must meet VFDSXVCVC3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline. 

Density of PP = 910 Kg/m³.  
Density of PA = 1140 Kg/m³.  

3.5 Traceability.  
For part requirements follow specification please refer to VinFast standard VFDST00010501.  

3.6 Labeling of Parts.  
Supplier must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Information must include figures indicating the positioning of labels on parts (setup position labels with pictures).  

3.7 Testing and validation and DVP&R.  
DVP and PC testing responsibilities follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for System, Sub-system & Component Level must align with Complete Vehicle Specification Book during the concept phase. A detailed test plan for hardware tests must be prepared, referencing file DVP&R while collaborating with the Testing & Validation department. Test details include:  
• Declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.  
• Devices used for testing (description of testing setup with pictures).  
• Testing locations (internal/external).  
• Duration and timeline of testing (in the form of a project plan).

### 3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.

Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is classified as part of the PPAP deliverable.

The AAR process is outlined in document VFDST00038401, which specifies quantity of parts and timing requirements.

For each step of the process, suppliers are responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design within the agreed timing. The goal is to attain OK Shape, OKTG (OK to Go), and AAR Approval. 

The process should commence early at PT build stage to secure AAR Approval at LS.

Suppliers must integrate this activity into their development process and include it in their Engineering Design & Development (ED&D) costs.

Exceptions: For EPDM and PA tube lines, AAR requirements are not applicable.
