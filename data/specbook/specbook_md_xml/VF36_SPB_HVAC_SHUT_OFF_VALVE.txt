### Refrigerant Shut Off Valve Key Operating Points:

- **Refrigerant**: R134a/R1234YF
- **Operating Voltage**: 9 – 18V
- **Valve Action**: 0V: Open / 12V: Closed

The solenoid valve is controlled by the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU). When the VCU detects insufficient battery heat dissipation or the inability to meet the battery heat dissipation requirements after increasing the compressor speed, the VCU will close the solenoid valve switch. This action cuts off refrigerant flow into the HVAC system, suspending refrigeration in the air conditioning system. As a result, power battery heat dissipation is accelerated. Once the power battery heat dissipation reaches its set value, the solenoid valve will reopen to allow refrigerant to flow back into the HVAC system, enabling the air-conditioning system to resume cooling.

### 3.3 General CAE Requirements
The general requirements for CAE analysis are available in the **SOR** document:
- Document Reference: VFSRXXCVC0201

</page>

<page number="8">
3 Requirements.

3.5 Traceability.
Part requirements must follow specifications as outlined in the VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

3.6 Labeling of Parts.
Suppliers must comply with VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Additionally, figures for the positioning of labels on parts, including setup pictures, need to be included.

3.7 Testing and validation and DVP&R.
DVP and PC test responsibilities are to follow the RASIC framework. DVP includes virtual and physical testing at the System, Sub-system, and Component levels, aligned with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase. A detailed test plan is required, supported by the Testing & Validation department. Testing specifications include:
- Declaration of standards, norms, and legal requirements.
- A description of the testing setup with accompanying pictures, including the devices used.
- Identification of the testing location (internal/external).

The supplier must ensure a mileage target life of 160,000 km or 10 years, whichever comes first.

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.
AAR activities must be completed as part of PPAP deliverables. Details of the AAR process are found in VFDST00038401, which includes information on quantities and timing. The supplier's responsibilities during the development process include submitting parts to VinFast Quality Design to obtain approval for shape (OK Shape), technical quality grading (OKTG), and AAR approval within agreed-upon timelines. Early phase preparations during PT builds are critical to securing AAR approval at LS builds. These activities must also account for ED&D costs. Note that this requirement does not apply to customers' aesthetic appearance.
