### 5.7.5 Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability)

#### 5.7.5.1 Purpose:
- Guarantee of a consistent design and development philosophy concerning operational strength from the complete vehicle level, over the system level, down to the component level.
- Ensuring of sufficient operational strength in relation to the intended, vehicle-typical use conditions.
- Consideration and ensuring of product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile.
- Definition of all requirements to ensure a sufficient operational strength of the complete vehicle, systems, and components (this technical specification is the basis for all system and component technical specifications).

#### 5.7.5.2 Basic Dimensioning of Complete Vehicle, Systems, and Components

- **Operating Loads:** Operating loads are those which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived from measurements with the benchmark vehicles available on Program VTS - Stiffness, Strength, and Durability Track loads provided by RLDA according to market standards to Develop Road Regions RLDA Data for Input to Structural Durability Test.

- **Tested Mileage:** The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car. The vehicle test mileage is equivalent to 200,000 kilometers of customer normal driving.

- **Special Events:** Special events are occurrences of low frequency (approx. <100) which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS braking.
  - The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.

The vehicle must be dimensioned such that:
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easily replaceable parts before body structure).
- Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either at the same or neighboring components (principle deformation before failure).

#### 5.7.5.3 Operational Strength Relevant on Vehicle Testing
- The testing must be performed as defined in the VinFast testing standards.
</page>

<page number="20">
Vehicle Durability testing:
Mileage Target Life: 200,000 km or 12 years (whichever comes first).
- **Structural Durability Test**: Utilization of RLDA according to Market Standards to develop RLDA Data corresponding to Road Regions Structural Durability Test. The complete vehicle is subjected to Road Simulator MTS 329 to accumulate total damage. Input loads such as longitudinal, lateral, and vertical road surface loads combined with driver maneuvers like braking, cornering, and acceleration are repeated to match the Target Life of the complete vehicle.
- **General Durability Test**: Conducted at Proving Ground with In-Market Correlation based on RLDA Data, repeated schedules reproduce sufficient operational strength aligned with customer target market requirements. Test mileage targets are adapted to the Proving Ground with calculated severity factors to validate reliability over a 200,000 km customer lifecycle.
- **Powertrain Durability**: Life Cycle Tests on engines and transmissions emphasize accelerating and decelerating cycles, high-speed cycles, and reverse gear cycles. Established cycle severity factors aim to match the total target life of 200,000 km. Inspections are conducted at the initial phase, major intervals (25%, 50%, 75%), and post-test phases to measure engine degradation.

### 5.7.5.4 Project Specific Targets Concerning Operational Strength
The requirements and targets for operational strength are outlined concerning:
1. Complete vehicle level.
2. Module/system level.
3. Component level.

### 5.7.6 Weight Management
The weight target aligns with VinFast's vision and the agreed customer market profile. Since vehicle weight greatly affects energy consumption, the objective is to minimize the complete vehicle weight. Weight-optimized designs across all components must be maintained throughout the development process.

VinFast Released.
</page>

<page number="32">
### Heating Outlets in the Footwell Area
Heating outlets (COP) in the footwell must create an even flow of heated air throughout the total footwell area. This should prevent hot spots on feet or legs as well as any noticeable cold air impact. The outlets should facilitate a quick heat-up of the entire passenger compartment and work with other outlets to establish steady state climate comfort for all passengers.

### Defrost Outlets
Defrost outlets are required to direct heated air to the windscreen and at least to the front side screens. This is necessary to rapidly and reliably defrost or demist large areas of the screens. Screens must remain free of mist during normal driving conditions without creating a disturbing noticeable air flow. Governmental requirements for defrost/demist (Regulation EU No 672/2010 for BEV) must be fulfilled. Once demisted, screens must not mist again under driving conditions.

### Absence of Air Draught for Climate Comfort
The HVAC system must maintain good coziness and avoid noticeable air draught under all typical driving and climatic conditions for intended market areas. Tests must ensure the system can be easily adjusted to achieve "Neutral" (+/-1) on the Assessment Index (AI) for coziness during normal adjustment of clothing. Temperature stratification in the passenger compartment must meet tolerance limits. Minor deviations are acceptable only in extreme climatic regions. The overall coziness and absence of air draught are assessed by the nominated team under controlled conditions.

### Passenger Compartment Air Pressure and Vehicle Tightness
Fresh air intake and rear air extraction must be designed and positioned to minimize air pressure changes in the passenger compartment. This ensures HVAC system functionality and maintains climate comfort. 

**Key Requirements:**
- Air pressure in the passenger compartment should undergo minimal changes when driving with closed windows at varying vehicle/wind speeds.
- Doors and trunk lid/tailgate must close freely without causing noticeable pressure peaks in the passenger compartment.
- HVAC system settings should not cause disturbing pressure changes.
- The passenger compartment must be sufficiently tight to avoid sudden climatic influences from the environment and minimize HVAC energy consumption.

**Specification:**
Passenger compartment air pressure must increase to at least **125 Pa** with a fresh air intake of **100 SCFM** delivered by the HVAC system when rear air extractors are closed tightly. Testing also includes verifying sufficient cross-sectional equivalency of rear air extraction during tightness evaluations of the car body.
</page>

<page number="33">
### 5.7.12.5 Recirculation air and rear air extraction
To achieve the required coziness and the necessary adjustability of the HVAC system, a symmetrical (left to right side) distribution of air amounts extracted from the passenger compartment or exhausted by rear extractors must be provided. Air passages in the footwell insulation panel (for recirculation air) and rear panels and interior parts (for extracted air) must be carefully tuned without sensibly increasing the pressure drop along these paths. Assessments will include driving and climatic conditions, considering temperature distribution and passenger compartment climate comfort.

### 5.7.12.6 Mass flow and distribution of conditioned air
Mass flow dynamics mostly depend on the HVAC system.

---

### 5.7.12.7 Temperature distribution
#### Temperatures at the air outlets
The HVAC system must deliver heating or cooling power with precise temperature and mass flow distribution corresponding to individual settings and situations in a reproducible manner.

#### Temperature control characteristics
Under steady driving conditions (road load), outlet temperatures must closely match the temperatures set by the control unit, with minimal deviations regardless of approach direction.

#### Temperature stratification
A stable coziness in steady conditions must be ensured through focused temperature differences between heat areas and footwell areas. The HVAC does not include a stratification function with a button.

### 5.7.12.8 Refrigerant circuit
The refrigerant circuit must perform stably and efficiently. The following tests and measurements will ensure these requirements:
- Determination of the optimal refrigerant charge.
- Passive heat-up evaluation.
- Maximum cool-down performance.
- Operating reliability under extreme atmospheric and operational conditions.
- Adjustment of blower speed characteristics.
- Determination of optimal lubricant charge.
- Evaluation of dryer/filter bottle position and charge air cooler placement.
- Analysis of climate compressor torque consumption characteristics.
</page>

<page number="34">
### Determination of the Optimal Charge of Refrigerant  
The optimal charge ensures a proper effect of the refrigerant circuit for as long as possible. This amount of refrigerant is slightly less than the threshold for overfill. Overfilling with refrigerant causes significant pressure and peak temperature increases on the high-pressure side, potentially reaching safety device limits and triggering an A/C cut-off as a consequence.

### Passive Heat Up  
The vehicle must not experience excessive temperatures inside the passenger compartment, even when parked in hot ambient conditions with high solar radiation. Passive heat up must be minimized to an acceptable level through optimized heat insulation on the roof and properly designed screen geometry, including sizes, angles, and thermal glass properties.

### Maximum Cool Down  
The vehicle must rapidly provide convenient cooling for passengers after startup, especially when heated up by a sunny environment. Prompt cooling must be ensured by delivering sufficient low-temperature air to the passenger compartment.

### Operation Reliability Under Extreme Ambient and Operating Conditions  
The A/C system must demonstrate sufficient cooling functionality even under high ambient temperature conditions.

### Adjustment of Blower Speed Characteristics  
Ensuring system efficiency requires optimized blower speed characteristics for sufficient cooling air output through the condenser.

### Determination of the Optimum Charge of Lubricant  
The supplier of the A/C compressor must define the necessary lubricant amount to ensure proper lubrication under all operating conditions. Pretesting should implement a lubricant fill according to supplier recommendations.

<page number="37">
Remark: The air pressure drop characteristics throughout the entire vehicle (all relevant components, the entire air path with special attention to the rear air extraction) has to be tuned carefully to reach the specifications.

**5.7.12.5 Recirculation air and rear air extraction**  
To achieve the required coziness and the necessary easy and exact HVAC system adjustability, a symmetrical (left to right side) distribution of the amounts of air to be extracted from the passenger compartment or to be exhausted by the rear extractors has to be provided. The air passages in the footwell insulation panel (for recirculation air) and in the rear panels and interior parts (for extracted air) have to be tuned carefully without sensibly increasing the pressure drop along these air paths. The assessments will consider all driving and climatic conditions by assessment of temperature distribution and passenger compartment climate comfort.

**5.7.12.6 Mass flow and distribution of conditioned air Mass flow**  
Mostly depending on the HVAC.

**5.7.12.7 Temperature distribution Temperatures at the air outlets**  
The required quality of the HVAC control is only achievable with an HVAC system delivering the required heating or cooling power of the air always with the correct temperature and mass flow distribution corresponding to the individual setting and situation in an exactly reproducible manner.

- **Temperature control characteristics**: Under steady-state driving conditions (road load) the temperatures at the corresponding outlets must follow the temperatures set by the control unit with very little deviation regardless of the direction of approach to the new setting.  
- **Temperature stratification**: A stable coziness in steady-state condition has to be ensured by concerted temperature differences between heat area and footwell area. HVAC; no stratification function with button.

**5.7.12.8 Refrigerant circuit**  
The required output of the refrigerant circuit must be achievable in a stable and efficient manner. The following tests and measurements will be performed to evaluate this goal:

- Operating reliability under extreme ambient and operating conditions  
- Adjustment of the blower speed characteristics  
- Determination of the optimum charge of lubricant  
- Evaluation of the appropriate position of the dryer/filter bottle and of the charge air cooler  
- Establishment of the climate compressor torque consumption characteristics  

**Determination of the optimal charge of refrigerant**  
The optimal charge ensures a proper effect of the refrigerant circuit for as long as possible. This amount of refrigerant is just a little less than the limit of overfill. An overfilling with refrigerant causes a significant increase of the pressure and the peak temperature at the high-pressure side. The limits of the safety devices can be reached, and an A/C cut-off will be the consequence.

**Passive heat up**  
The vehicle must not suffer from too high temperatures in the passenger compartment even when parked in hot ambient and at high solar radiation. This passive heat up inside the passenger compartment has to be minimized to an acceptable level by appropriate heat insulation of the roof and solar radiation protection of the screens by optimized geometry (sizes and angles) and thermal properties of the glass.

**Maximum cool down**  
Passengers should get convenient cooling as fast as possible after the start of the vehicle when heated up in the sun. To demonstrate the cooling capacity of the system, the passenger compartment must be cooled immediately by sufficient air of corresponding low temperature.

**Operation reliability under extreme ambient and operation conditions**  
Even with extreme hot ambient temperatures, the A/C system has to show sufficient cooling function.

**Adjustment of the blower speed characteristics**  
Good system efficiency requires sufficient cooling air drawn through the condenser, which is only possible with optimized cooling fan speed characteristics.

**Determination of the optimum charge of lubricant**  
The supplier of the A/C compressor shall establish the necessary amount of lubricant. The lubrication of the compressor has to be ensured under all operating conditions. During pretesting, a lubricant fill according to the supplier suggestion shall be used.

**5.7.12.9 Heating circuit supply of coolant**  
A satisfactory heating even at very low ambient temperatures requires a minimum value for the coolant flow through the heater circuit of the HVAC unit.  

- **Heat up**: The quick heat up of the passenger compartment when driving after a cold start has to be ensured.

**5.7.12.10 Defrost/demist**

**Occurrence of condensed water in the vehicle**  
In principle, condensing water can be generated on any cold part of the HVAC (refrigerant lines, installation location of the evaporator, cold air ducts). This condensed water must not enter any electric/electronic components sensitive against humidity and must not drop or trickle into the passenger compartment.

**5.7.13 Thermal management & Powertrain cooling heat protection**  
The development and validation of the heat protection in the complete vehicle ensure that all relevant component temperatures remain below the maximum allowed limits, which are derived from vehicle operation at an ambient specific to the markets.  

- **Powertrain & Electric vehicle cooling**  
The design of the cooling system is carried out, taking into account not only the functionality of the system but also packaging specifications.

Simulation  
Based on the cooling system layout, a 1D simulation model is set up in order to validate the existing concept with regard to the modified air flow situation due to exterior modification. If some component data is not yet available for this evaluation (i.e., in a very early phase), necessary assumptions based on engineering judgment will be made. Simulation will be done in parallel to experiments during the whole development phase with the purpose of validation and improvement of the cooling system as well as for the optimization of components dimensioning.

Testing & Function Calibration  
- All relevant engine and powertrain fluid temperatures have to be measured according to VF Thermal Testing Standard in PT & PTO vehicles. These temperatures shall remain below the maximum allowed limits.

### Gas Intrusion Test
The complete vehicle is also tested for gas-tightness with regard to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide content. Target levels are set for several different customer relevant load cases including defined vehicle conditions, e.g., HVAC settings.

### Wet Vehicle Pollution (Wet Dirt Contamination)
These tests are performed with a lead vehicle, conducted during customer-relevant freeway trips and over-land trips on a wet and polluted road (highway, overland, gravel road). Heavy rain is avoided, and the safety distance from the testing vehicle to the lead vehicle is adjusted to match environmental and road conditions.

### Icing Test – Function Test
The components of the vehicle—doors, closures, soft-top—are tested for functionality under customer-orientated conditions such as icing after rain and extreme icing with drizzle. The vehicle must fully perform without parts breaking or cracking. No fixation shall get loose, and no Squeak & Rattle issues shall occur except during the first operating. Higher operating forces are accepted although no damages are permitted.

### 5.7.17 Customer Function & Human Machine Interface (HMI)
In general, all complete vehicle customer function targets are outlined in the complete vehicle target catalogue in Appendix 3. The complete vehicle must remain fully operational within defined environmental conditions and for the specified lifetime and mileage as described in Chapter 4.7.3.

### Vehicle Features, Usability, and HMI Design
All vehicle features are defined in the complete vehicle feature lists, aligned with the customer's vision as technically outlined in PALS (Appendix 2). The HMI concept aims to provide clear usability and design, enabling access to mechatronic/mechanical functions via a center console display. Position, design, and functionality of all switches, lights, flaps, etc., are further described in Appendix 6 or the Human Machine Interface Book (HMI Book).

### Engineering Activities for HMI Include:
- **Engineering Judgement**:
  - Customer experienced function assessment.
  
- **Seating Comfort**:
  - CO parts are utilized for seat structures while foam and trim designs are modified to align with benchmark comfort.
  - Basic seat comforts are evaluated using hardware; no virtual seat comfort developments are performed.

- **Display and Operating Concepts**:
  - Definition, specification, and ongoing studies around the HMI display/operational concept for relevant components from the customer's perspective.
  - All HMI functions are validated on the complete vehicle level and documented in an HMI specification book.

- **Testing of Complete Vehicles**:
  - Prototype Functional Acceptance (PTFA) and Road Release (RR) testing for Mule and PTO vehicles are conducted.

### Homologation
During vehicle development and testing, all relevant legal requirements for engineering scope and planned markets are to be considered and fulfilled.

### Homologation for UK/Australia/Thailand/Singapore Markets
The general development guidelines for the VFe33_RHD markets include adherence to the following regulations:
- **UK Market**: UN Regulation, Regulation (EU).
- **Australia Market**: UN Regulation, Regulation (EU), and ADR (Australian Design Rule).
- **Thailand Market**: UN Regulation, Regulation (EU), and TISI (Thai Industrial Standards Institute).

electrical systems and functions are planned to guarantee correct implementation and will be carried out according to VF standards. The generic Function Release Step (FRS) is outlined in the picture. The detailed timing and description of each FRS is defined in the FRS Plan of each project. The FRS plan has to be fulfilled by every electric component.

### Physical testing  
For early physical and software testing, Lab Cars, Network Test Bench, and several Subsystem Test Benches will be set up. Parts such as ECUs, sensors, actuators, and connectors shall be delivered free of charge for physical testing. Key electrical tests will be defined to support the road release of test vehicles. Generally, all main simulation and testing activities on vehicle level are outlined in DVP. Tests under supplier responsibility are outlined in respective component/system specifications.  

EMC for vehicle-level VFeXX should follow VFDST00026304, VFDST00026305, VFDST00026306, and must comply with ECE r10.06 for EU homologation and Canada CMVSS version of CISPR12.

**6 Complete Vehicle Testing - DVP**  
The testing phase is structured in these phases:  
- Mule Generation  
- EP  
- PTO  
- PP  

Mule vehicle testing focuses on chassis, powertrain, and thermal system tests with load spectrum measurements for BIW durability evaluations. Testing drivable vehicles and partial build-ups will support vehicle structure validation.  
Tests for fulfilling targets will be conducted using complete vehicle/vehicles of the PPV. Powertrain and thermal test bench testing are VF’s responsibility.  
System & component tests are the suppliers’ and their sub-contractors' responsibilities.  

The complete Design & Verification Plan (DVP) for all vehicle functions is detailed in DVP appendix 4:  
- VFDSACCVC2803  
- VFe33/34s_RHD_Appendix_4_BEV_DVP_Design Verification Plan

**7 Reporting and Documentation**

**7.1 Information Exchange**  
VF has established a data exchange server to streamline communication and reduce email traffic. This server facilitates the exchange of documents, including:  
- Meeting minutes  
- Work reports  
- Planning documentation  
- Testing documentation  
- Styling feedback  
- Specifications
</page>

<page number="63">
**7.1 Information Exchange**  
CAD data shall be exchanged via Teamcenter or Supplier collaboration.

**7.2 Documentation and Archiving Obligations**  
Description without archiving obligation description.

**7.3 Priority and Up-to-Datedness of Documents**  
This document focuses on the description of the complete vehicle functions and performance. Details with regard to design can be found in CAD data or further applicable documents.  
Generally, in case of contradictory statements in specifications or other documents, the released drawings have higher priority. Discrepancies must be clarified immediately upon occurrence and documented appropriately to ensure stable clarification.  

General document priority (1 = highest priority):  
1. Legal Requirements  
2. Contractual Agreements  
3. Drawings, 3D-models, and the project-specific functional dimension catalog  
4. System and Component Specifications  
5. Standards VinFast / International  
6. Other specification books which will be quoted with further applicable documents  
7. Internal technical regulations which will be quoted with further applicable documents, other general terms and conditions  
8. National and international norms and standards (DIN, EN, ISO, etc.) which will be quoted with further applicable documents  

**7.4 Change Documentation and Part History Documentation**  
VinFast has set up criteria and a change management process (see also Chapter 3.8.) to enable efficient handling, documentation, and confirmation of changes by the involved parties (VinFast/Suppliers Tier 1-x).  
The goal is to evaluate each change request’s impact on product- and program targets, quality, timing, and product cost.  

Suppliers are required to collaborate within this change management process throughout concept and serial development phases. Specifically, suppliers must implement confirmed changes and notify VinFast in writing about any impact on the project/program within three weeks.  

Suppliers must also provide data in a format defined by VinFast to ensure proper documentation of changes during development and, if applicable, production processes (e.g., entries in a project manual).  

Change requests caused within a supplier’s development scope that impact cost, timing, or quality will be handled by the claim management process. Such change requests can only be confirmed by purchasing.

**7.5 Vehicle Documentation**  
All complete vehicle buildups will be documented using the PRODAP system (PRODuction Applications Platform). This database will include vehicle-specific documentation of:  
1. Actual Build Condition  
2. Variable product data, e.g., engine serial number, gearbox serial number, etc.  
3. Checklists for all relevant screw torques
</page>

<page number="64">
4. Executed rework.
5. Reporting of all gathered data.

In general, systems or parts which have to fulfill safety regulations of VinFast or legal requirements must include a remark on the drawing. VF will provide a document which lists the reasons and the characteristics that must be documented.

### 7.6 Traceability
All parts delivered to the customer must be clearly traceable by proper identification marking if they are relevant for declared traceability. A clear concept for traceability will be implemented by VF and supported by suppliers. Marking of parts shall follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010 and DMC label requirements as per VFDST00010501.
