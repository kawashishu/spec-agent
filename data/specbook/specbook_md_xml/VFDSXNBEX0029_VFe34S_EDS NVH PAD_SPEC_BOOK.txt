Purpose of these NVH pads is to absorb airborne noise to aid in improved NVH performance of the vehicle. NVH pads are part of the functional black commodities on the VFe34S model. The noise test needs to be performed at the alpha cabin, and it will generate the performance chart similar to the figure below. The result needs to be confirmed by the NVH engineer.

#### Figure Description:
The included graph represents "Random Incident Absorption Coefficient per SAE." The x-axis shows the 1/3 Octave Band Center Frequency (ranging from 400 to 8000), while the y-axis displays the Sound Absorption Coefficient (ranging from 0 to 1.2). The chart illustrates the absorption performance of the EDS_NVH_PAD_RR, demonstrating improved NVH capabilities particularly at higher frequencies.
