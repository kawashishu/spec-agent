**RASI Definition:**  
- **R**: Responsible  
Responsible for proper execution of the activities to fulfill the requirements. She/he is entitled to request the necessary support from other project team members.  
- **A**: Approval  
Obligation to decide/responsible for release. If no decider is defined, the person who is responsible for execution (R) is the decider.  
- **S**: Support  
Obligated to actively support (even if this requires capacity, expenses, and/or transfer of know-how). This project team member must proactively assist the person responsible for execution (R) in achieving the targets.  
- **I**: Information
