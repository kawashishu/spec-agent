3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.  
AAR is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is described in the VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing).  
For each step of the process, the supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  
The process will start in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS.  
The supplier has to include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.  

4 Function Safety, Homologation and Safety Regulations.  
Safety is one of the key issues in the development and integration of automotive functionalities.  
Functional safety is concerned with E/E systems.

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.  
The Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is detailed in VFDST00038401, which establishes the quantity of parts and timing. Suppliers have the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timelines with VF to secure approvals for OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR.  

The process starts early during the PT build phase and aims to ensure AAR approval by the LS stage. Suppliers are required to integrate this activity into their development process and allocate it within ED&D costs.
