### Hardness:
According to the provisions of GB 9439 and GB 231, samples are taken and tested using Brinell hardness. The hardness of the rotor shall meet 180 HB-241 HB, and the hardness variation of two brake surfaces and the same brake surface of the rotor shall be less than 20 HB.

### Tensile Strength:
According to GB 9439 and GB 228, samples from the rotor must have a tensile strength of >250 MPa.

### Metallography:
According to ASTM a247, the rotor must have type VII flake graphite composed of type A and type B, with type A >85%, type A+B >98%, and types E and F not allowed. Graphite type is grade 4-6, with a matrix of fine flake pearlite. The proportion of pearlite must exceed 98%, ferrite must be less than 2%, and no cementite is permitted.

### Detection Part:
The surface parallel to the braking surface of the friction ring is the detection part, as shown in related figures.

### Aging Treatment:
Aging treatment methods must be determined by the supplier to ensure that the internal stress of casting does not affect dimensional processing stability. The working surface and mounting surface of the brake disc must be free from oil stains, impurities, or other pollutants.

### Surface Defects:
No residual casting convex or concave defects are allowed on the working surface or stress area. The working surface must be free from collision marks, scratches, cracks, burrs, rust, or other unknown spots.

### Inspection:
Before the production process stabilizes, 100% X-ray inspection and magnetic particle inspection must be carried out. After stabilization, X-ray inspection and 100% magnetic particle inspection must follow the control plan.

### Unbalance:
The rotor's unbalance must be less than 30 g·cm, and two balanced milling points are permitted within 70 degrees.

### Surface Treatment:
Point A-point B and point C-point D are designated coating areas, with a maximum overspray area of 2 mm allowed in non-coating areas. Coating in over-spraying areas must be gradually thinned as illustrated in Figure 3.

### Salt Spray Test:
After 240 hours of neutral salt spray testing, the paint layer must remain intact without bubbling or detachment. The substrate cannot rust, though 3% edge corrosion is acceptable. Uncoated areas and disc working surfaces are excluded from evaluation.

### High-Temperature Test:
The paint must not exhibit bubbles, cracks, delamination, or other failures after being subjected to 300 ± 5°C for 180 minutes. Uncoated areas and disc working surfaces are excluded from evaluation.

### Production Stability:
The supplier must confirm all processes and technical statuses of part production. No changes are permitted without prior approval.

### Restricted Substances Compliance:
Parts must meet restricted substance requirements.

6 Supplier responsibilities.  
Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.  

**Customer service requirements**  

- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

- **Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need to ensure life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST ends production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.  

- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).  

**7 Intellectual Property / Copyright**  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).  

**8 Insurance / Warranties**  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).  

**9 VinFast GTC & Part Packaging and Incoterms**  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition, Part packaging requirements, and Incoterms requirement in the RFQ package.
