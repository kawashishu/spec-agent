</page>

<page number="16">
### Additional Requirements
Primer type and amount will be defined according to VF Manufactory specification and shown on the 2D drawing with annotation to define product name and area of application. Additional detail has to be defined in co-operation with VINFAST manufacturing through detailed analysis and design. The system should be easily assembled into the vehicle, following industrial standards for windscreen assembly procedures. Mounting procedures must be secured through virtual verification. 

The system will be assembled by hand with re-usable tools to keep the part in position until the stability of the windscreen is reached. The definition of process time will come from the manufactory, and mounting tolerances for assembly of the windscreen on the vehicle assembly line will be defined by the manufactory. Tightening of the glue to BIW will be determined by engineering during serial development and has to be verified during mounting operation.

---

### Test Plan
The test plan specifies by whom and when testing will be conducted and which testing devices are necessary. The plan must visually show results and testing progress. The controlling of test results must be ensured at all times. If VinFast requests verification of test results, SDS must deliver the needed parts free of charge.

Test procedures and documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly or whenever new data/information is needed due to development changes.

The SDS is responsible for the complete safeguarding of their component. Testing must be planned in advance to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. SDS must ensure that VinFast receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast/SDS.

If testing is conducted using incorrect parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, re-testing is required and costs will be borne by SDS. In the case of negative test results, tests must be re-planned, and retesting costs will be covered by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

---

### Test Plan
The test plan determines by whom and when testing will be completed and the necessary testing devices. It visually displays results and testing progress while ensuring the controlling of test results at all times. If VinFast requests verification of test results, the SDS must deliver the required parts free of charge. 

The test procedures and documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan requires weekly updates and supplementation with new data/information due to developmental changes if necessary. Responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the component belongs to the SDS. Testing must be scheduled in advance to secure approval and re-testing if necessary, conforming to committed schedules. The SDS must ensure VinFast receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and has access to testing either at the SDS site or their testing centers. Changes to approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast and SDS.

If improper parts, missing parts, or alternative testing procedures occur, testing must be redone at SDS expense. In the event of negative test results, SDS must replan the tests and retesting will again be funded by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

#### Data Required in DVP&R:
- Testing with declarations of standards, norms, and legal requirements.
- Descriptions of testing setups with pictures and the devices used.
- Identification of the responsible test department.
- Details of where testing occurred (internal/external).

### 5.3 Material Requirement
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC.

#### Corrosion Requirements
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system as follows:

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

**General Guidelines**
- The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity.
- Material combinations should be chosen to prevent galvanic corrosion. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.
- If a critical material combination exists, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).
- Avoid water and dirt accumulation; always provide drainage at the lowest positions.
</page>

<page number="22">
Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements. Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement. Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

</page>

<page number="24">
Terminals, connectors must not be placed at the lowest points. Corrosion protection for terminals requires tight electrical connections to protect from humidity. Connecting surfaces of grounding components must be water-tight if situated in a corrosive environment. Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% should be avoided in sealing surfaces due to the risk of moisture penetration via corrosion.

### Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues
The risk of damage to bodywork and parts from stone chipping should be addressed through the following:
- Shield easily damageable parts.
- Enlarge radii in high-risk areas to prevent severe issues.
- Use materials and paint with matching colours in high-risk areas to obscure visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.
- Lower chrome styling elements in areas accessible to stone impacts to reduce exposure.

### Responsibility of System Supplier
The supplier must define and confirm material specifications to ensure economic material recycling at the vehicle’s end of life.

### 5.8 NVH and Driving Comfort
**General:**  
The VINFAST target system for windscreens is oriented on VINFAST reference vehicles.

Gas and water tightness form the basis for acoustic tightness and must be sufficiently achieved. The system must not cause any kind of disturbing sound during operation, including wind noise, squeak and rattle, temperature or flexural torsion effects. Appropriate measures are needed to prevent operating noises (e.g., wind or whining noises) or deaden them to the greatest extent possible to achieve acceptable noise levels.
</page>

<page number="27">
5.8 NVH and Driving Comfort.

Squeak and rattle (S&R) effects which may occur during high-speed driving of the vehicle, particularly at certain humidity levels, must be avoided by utilizing suitable profile design and choosing high-quality surface coating processes. Appropriate material pairing with adequate durability must be ensured. The NVH team can assist in selecting materials due to potential buzzing, squeak, and rattle noise generation. 

All seal system components must be designed to reduce aerodynamic resistance and optimize aero-acoustic characteristics. To demonstrate disturbing noise freedom, requirements must be aligned with the VF NVH testing team.

Additional functional characteristics and technical requirements include:
- Determining window thickness in collaboration with VinFast while maintaining reference vehicle dimensions (4.96 mm).
- Guaranteeing adequate sound insulation to ensure audibility of audio warnings and acoustic signals (e.g., sirens) from the environment.
- Ensuring materials, surfaces, and shapes of individual components do not impair adjoining components' functions, including windscreen and BIW process-related tolerances.
- Implementing an interlayer acoustic PVB (THK 0.76 mm) to meet transmission loss characteristics.

Laminated Glass specifications:
- Outer layer: 2.1 mm heat absorption standard green (TSA 3+).
- PVB: 0.76 mm with green shade band.
- Inner layer: 2.1 mm standard green.

The supplier must guarantee the following:
- No amplification of wind noise and vibrations on BIW.
- Avoidance of noise caused by component functions or joint tolerances.
- Prevention of whistling, buzzing, squeaking, and rattling noises during high-speed driving.
- Fulfillment of operational and environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity.

5.9 Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability).

- Ensure adequate operational strength concerning intended vehicle operational conditions (operating loads and special events).
- Consider and verify product-specific characteristics derived from the application profile.
- Define all requirements to ensure operational strength for complete vehicles, subsystems, and components, which will serve as the basis for technical specifications.
- Mounting force must be less than dismounting force.

Operating Loads:
Operating loads are derived from measurements conducted using base reference vehicles on tracks defined by VF. These loads occur during the intended use of the vehicle. 

Customer Usage Definition:
The customer usage definition is based on VinFast’s standard for MCE (Mixed Circuit Europe = long-distance durability run). The tested mileage, derived from the desired customer vehicle mileage target, is set at 160,000 km. The vehicle lifetime must be at least 10 years.
</page>

<page number="28">
### Environmental Operating Conditions
The environmental operating conditions are:  
- -30°C to +50°C ambient  
- 0 - 100% relative humidity  
- -100m to 3500 m above mean sea level  

### Special Events
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100) that belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned so special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life is not reduced.  

### Misuse Events
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned so that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable to the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is maintained after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).  
Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or neighboring components (principle: "deformation before break").  

### Weight Management
Because the vehicle weight significantly influences energy consumption, the goal of weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight.  
Throughout the development process, attention must be paid to weight-optimized design of all components. All weight reduction potentials must be shown by the supplier, along with their impact on cost, timing, quality, etc.  
The total system weight must not exceed a target of:  
**C-CUV Front: 15.15 Kg**

### In-Vehicle Thermal and Thermal Comfort
- The Technical Requirement for Defrost & Demist must be fulfilled.  
- Heat absorbing glass is required to achieve a good thermal comfort level inside the vehicle.

### Package
- Please refer to ISO 16750.

### Recycling
#### Recycled Materials:
When selecting materials, attention must focus on reducing the variety of materials and compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  

Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g. recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) must be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials must be marked according to the parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert’s team at VinFast.

#### Recycling Scheme:
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.

Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at the end-of-life.  

The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to present a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  

The recycling scheme must be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.
