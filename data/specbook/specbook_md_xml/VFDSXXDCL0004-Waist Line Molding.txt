Rate of elongation at break (%) ranges from -25 to 0 for most of the materials except for gelatin sponge where it ranges from -35 to 0.

Resistance to water at (80 + 2) ℃ / 120 h includes:
- Hardness change (shore A): 0 ~ +5.
- Rate of change of tensile strength (%): -15 ~ +15.
- Rate of elongation at break (%): -25 ~ 0 for most materials, except gelatin sponge.

Apparent density g/cm³ applies only to the gelatin sponge with a value of 0.65 ± 0.15.

Compression permanent deformation standards are:
- At (23 + 2) ℃ / 72 h: 35 or less for most materials, 40 or less for some.
- At (70 + 2) ℃ / 24 h: 50 or less for most materials, 55 or less for others.

Brittleness temperature (℃): No more than -40 for most materials, but -36 for gelatin sponge.

Ozone aging resistance:
- Stretch: 20% at (40 + 2) ℃ / 72 h—No crack is allowed.
- Ozone concentration: (2 ± 0.2) x 10^-6.

Additional requirements include:
1. Air window belt strip and flocking belt strip are subject to water resistance testing.
2. Dumbbell-shaped specimens in tensile strength and elongation at break tests should preferably use type 2 specimens.

- Boundary dimensions: Supplier parts dimensional tolerances, functional dimensions are required by VINFAST3D, and 2D data GD&T. The measuring points and tolerances of parts shall be subject to the drawings of VINFASTGD&T.

- Quality Requirement: Supplier must meet the quality commitment made, that is, 10 waste products per 1,000,000 parts sent to shall be guaranteed. PPM 10, important features: CPK 1.33 (according to project requirements and actual conditions).

- Identification requirements:
  - Party B shall mark party A's logo, supplier code, part number, batch number/traceability code on the products (including the status of split spare parts), and submit the specific marking scheme to party A for approval. Relevant requirements shall be in accordance with the parts drawings and party A's provisions on auto parts identification.
  - Party B shall hang the barcode on the accurately traced parts specified by party A, and the coding rules and relevant requirements shall be implemented in accordance with the parts drawings and party A's provisions on the identification of auto parts.
  - Party B shall obtain the written consent of party A in advance for special cases in which marking is not allowed or part of the marking is not allowed. Party B shall be responsible for the claim retroactively for the three packages of the supporting parts and after-sales parts or provide the way of record identification.
  - Party B shall not stamp or paste party B's explicit information (such as its own trademark, name, etc.) on the products (special circumstances subject to written approval of party A).

- Product quality rectification responsibility:
  - If party B is responsible for the design and manufacturing of spare parts, it shall be solely responsible for the rectification of product quality (including design, mold, process, etc.) except for modeling changes.
  - If party A (or a third party) undertakes the design and party B undertakes the manufacturing, party B shall organize the review and countersignature of the design data before accepting the design data. Once the design data freeze countersignature form is signed, party B shall be solely responsible for the rectification of product quality (including design, mold, process, etc.) except for modeling changes.
  - The newly put into production of molds must go through the production verification stage to ensure the matching accuracy of parts and components with the whole vehicle. Mold adjustment for solving the problem of vehicle coordination is not an engineering change. The supplier shall control the production quantity of the sample as required, actively cooperate, and bear the corresponding mold adjustment costs. 
  - Party B shall, with respect to the split parts that have been specifically negotiated for after-sales maintenance, ensure that the product performance, structure, and appearance quality meet the same requirements of the assembly parts and submit the product qualification certificate.

- The supplier must ensure that the developed parts comply with VN regulations and VINFAST specifications, obtain component type approval, and submit all necessary documents to support vehicle type approval.

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.
AAR is a PPAP deliverable.

The AAR process is outlined in VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing). At each step of the process, the Supplier must submit parts to VF Quality Design within agreed timelines to secure OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval. 

The process begins early, starting at PT build, to ensure AAR Approval is completed at LS. The Supplier is required to incorporate this activity into their development process and ED&D Cost.

### 6 Supplier responsibilities

Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier Responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements:**

After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.
</page>

<page number="23">
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

### Spare Parts Support Cycle
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall ensure life cycles of the project and meet the requirements in GTC after VINFAST's end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

### Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST's after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. Information provided should include:
- BOM table
- Parts structure and function description
- Fault diagnosis
- Special tools for maintenance
- Relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).
