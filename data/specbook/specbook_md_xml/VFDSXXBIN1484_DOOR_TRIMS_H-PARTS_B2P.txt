**Common Information for Front and Rear Door**

**Function Requirements:**  
Most important functions of door trim:  
- Covering of DIW and other systems according to styling requirements, considering targets of legal and market requirements.  
- Tightness against water, air leakage, and dust.
</page>

<page number="12">
Most important functions of door trim include noise absorption, absorbing properties in case of side impact, integration of add-on parts, and providing full functionality over their lifetime.

Overall, the primary targets for the development of the ASM door trim are:
- The avoidance of functional and qualitative problems from known systems.
- The use of standard parts and common parts wherever possible and convenient.
- Maintaining process reliability in manufacturing, packaging, transport, and assembly.
- Minimizing the effort in the overall production sequence: production, packaging, transport, and assembly on the line.
- Prevention of displacement and integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of the part package (Simultaneous Engineering) from the concept phase onward with early inclusion of the developers of neighboring components, such as body shell and inner side finisher.
- Achieving general reduction in costs compared to the predecessor model.
- Further improvement of acoustic, optical, and functional characteristics.

Functionality must be assured within a temperature range of -30°C (-5°C for Vietnam market) to +85°C. Support for side airbag performance and sound performance must be provided alongside fulfilling ergonomic requirements. Ensure sufficient clearance, with a minimum of 70 mm, between the door trim and seat adjustment devices.

Stiffness, rigidity, and stability of shape are crucial in ensuring that no instability is noticeable, particularly in the area of operating elements. This includes prohibiting irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, and visible waviness under climatic change loads.

Door trim requirements specify that no detaching, fracturing, or splitting of parts is allowed. This condition applies during crash tests or airbag deployment and holds even in low temperature ranges.

**NVH and Driving Comfort**

**General: Complete Vehicle NVH and Driving Comfort Targets:**  
The vehicle shall enable an acoustics and vibration comfort which is well balanced with vehicle dynamics and drivability so that long-distance driving comfort, as well as driving over rough roads, is neither exhausting nor annoying. This requires the absolute absence of squeak & rattle issues under all load cases (speed, maneuver, temperature, etc.).

**Supplier Responsibility**
</page>

<page number="16">
The validation of NVH and driving comfort will be done on complete vehicle level and comprises real customer operation conditions. Before the validation on complete vehicle level takes place, the supplier has to assure readiness of the components, respectively the system, for durability and general testing. The evidence for the test maturity of the components has to be reported in the DVP&R (Design, Verification, and Development Report) at the component level.

System suppliers are requested to perform validation activities as specified in respective technical specifications. All parts that are required for the validation activities are specified by DVP&R and shall meet the required maturity level. VINFAST will define quality criteria and validation methods for alignment with suppliers. In general, it is mandatory for the supplier to support the NVH development process and the complete product cycle as well. The support comprises intensive and active cooperation with the development team and manufacturing regarding root cause investigations. The supplier has to consider and support the achievement of complete vehicle NVH targets (objective and subjective targets) at component and system level.

All components have to be free of squeak and rattle noises to avoid psychoacoustic annoyance during all operation conditions of the vehicle, including audio acoustic excitation. The robustness of design has to be assured and reported virtually and in the hardware phase before serial release. The sound of actuation noises must not be audible, respectively representing a high-quality impression integrated into the complete vehicle. The requirements are to be performed in all specified environmental and thermic conditions. During serial manufacturing, a capable quality assurance process has to be established to ensure the quality level. The supplier has to provide components for testing and NVH tuning and ensures the participation of specialists during local testing and troubleshooting processes.

**Vehicle Safety**

**Cooperation with VINFAST vehicle safety department:**  
The supplier is responsible to support the integration of vehicle safety functions actively. Lifetime relevant laws and ratings of selling markets as well as OEM requirements must be taken into account.

**Specific demands:**  
- Geometrical targets, e.g.:  
  - Distance to seat in side bags deployment relevant area ≥ 65mm.  
  - Shape homogeneity with respect to several dummy regions.  
- Additional sub-targets will be defined by VINFAST:  
  - Resistance at several trim areas, unless further definition donor vehicle stiffness must be aspired.  
  - As a validation base and optimization approach, donor vehicle parts must be tested too.  
  - Without claim to be complete, VINFAST assumes minimum 30 tests on donor vehicle door trim and project-specific PT parts before 2 months before PR release.
</page>

<page number="17">
General demands.

Unless further specific definitions are provided, the following points must be considered by the supplier:
- Vehicle safety functions must be optimally prepared on the system level through expertise, CAE, and testing.
- Project-relevant supplier data must be handed over to VINFAST upon request and free of charge, with VINFAST authorized to share this data within the project.
- Target fulfillment of performances with spread effects must be thoroughly secured by adequate numbers of worst-result identical test series results.
- Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand for achieving vehicle data freeze milestones. These models must be in LsDyna format, validated and numerically/physically stable.
- FE meshes must be homogeneous, aligned with part axes/geometry, and maintained at a density of 8-10 mm. Non-compliant meshes must be revised.
- For generating validated CAE material cards, suppliers are responsible for planning, performing, and financing activities, which must include principle tests on systems and components.
- Supplier-specific parts required for testing activities at any project party must be provided free of charge. However, costs for physical parts and CAE modeling incurred by suppliers must be addressed by them.
- Integration of requests from VINFAST's full vehicle crash optimization process must be accepted without additional charges, including material definitions, thickness adjustments, and optimization work.

General requirements:
- A mandatory 20% safety margin must be applied to each single target value.
- Occupant survival area integrity must account for part behavior and fluids, ensuring that parts directly and indirectly in contact with passengers meet safety standards.
- Parts cannot have edges below 3.2 mm during or after impact.
- Electrical system integrity must be preserved during impact and for post-crash functions.
- The tolerances and robustness of target achievement must be given proper consideration.
- Asymmetries must be investigated on each side to confirm reliable worst-case conditions by VINFAST.
- Modifiers for any rating are not permitted.

Additionally, suppliers must adhere to case-specific demands.

- Sequential deployment of all pyrotechnic components to avoid noise and pressure peaks while enabling a deployment check per component.
- After deployment, no solid combustion residues should remain classified as toxic or hazardous waste under valid waste legislation. Otherwise, components must be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances.
- Successful deployment must be immediately and visibly clear, either acoustically, directly at the vehicle, or via a feedback tool at the deployment device.
- Marking the positions of all pyrotechnic components, especially “hidden” ones like battery safety clamps and active safety headrests.
- Non-deployed pyrotechnic components must be removed without requiring pre-dismantling, ensuring accessibility of fasteners. 

### Recycling:
#### Recycled Materials:
Selection of materials must focus on reducing material variety and ensuring compatibility with available recycling methods ("proven recycling technologies"). 
- Secondary raw materials such as recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, and recycled thermoplastics should be prioritized for market availability.
- Recycled materials must be marked per parts marking standards and reported to VINFAST’s environmental compliance expert team.

#### Recycling Scheme:
- Must establish a simple, clear recycling process layout for components, including preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.

2. **Blistering:**  
   - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  

3. **Edge corrosion:**  
   - ≤ 10%  

4. **Weld seam corrosion:**  
   - ≤ 5%  

5. **Degree of rusting:**  
   - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).  

The interior is basically considered as a dry area, meaning an area with low corrosivity. Exceptions might include the floor area or areas where wetness, abrasion by shoes, or drinking juices could produce corrosion. When combining different metals, galvanic corrosion should be avoided by coating those parts.
</page>

<page number="30">
Edges, especially painted edges, shall be burr-free for good edge coverage and avoiding wear. Seat structures made of uncoated blank steel must be corrosion-free, and areas with corrosion risks should not be visible to the customer. Extreme positions of the seat rests should also be considered for corrosion risks.

For other invisible areas, test criteria may be relaxed but must ensure that no corrosive products appear in visible areas. Additionally, full functionality over the component’s lifetime must be assured. 

Vehicle tooling, usually stored in the trunk, is considered to have low corrosivity exposure. However, tool surfaces subject to wear may experience medium corrosivity.

### Test Plan
The test plan specifies by whom and when testing will be conducted, detailing the required testing devices. It includes visuals showing results, progress tracking, and ensures test result validation at all times. If VINFAST requests verification of test results independently, the required parts must be delivered by SDS free of charge.

Test procedures and documentation must receive approval from the validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST. The test plan must be updated weekly during the testing phase or as required by developmental changes.

Responsibilities for complete safeguarding lie with the SDS, which must ensure timely testing to allow approvals or retesting for any negative outcomes. VINFAST must be provided with all test protocols/reports for verification, and VINFAST personnel should be allowed to attend tests at SDS sites or testing centers. 

Deviations from approved procedures must be agreed upon between VINFAST and SDS. Any testing errors resulting from wrong parts, missing parts, or different test procedures will require retesting, with the costs borne by SDS. Failures during the procedure that lead to negative results also require retesting at SDS's expense.

### Required Data for the Development Validation Plan and Report (DVP&R):
- Declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirements under which the tests were conducted.
- Description of the testing setup, including specifications and pictures of the devices used.
- Identification of the responsible test department.
- Information on where the tests were conducted (internal or external).
- Duration and timeline of the tests displayed as part of the project plan.

• Part variant, description of part.
• No. of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible to use the DVP&R template provided by VINFAST testing department. The content of the DVP&R is under the responsibility of the SDS.

The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage. 

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST.

The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VINFAST departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department VINFAST and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.

### Testing  
#### General  
The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart.

It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.

In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS have to be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered by the SDS from VINFAST. 

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for only his component. Moreover, it must be guaranteed that all internal VINFAST requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VINFAST.

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved.

All tests must be documented according to VINFAST standard, alternatively to SDS standard, if this is accepted by VINFAST.

The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification.

The tests have to be brought in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.
</page>

<page number="32">
Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time or no later than the agreed date, as coordinated with the test department.

VINFAST "Logistics" determines the number of sample parts, while VINFAST "Purchase" orders these parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports for all required tests according to the DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be conducted by the SDS.

### Release by Test Departments
The responsible VINFAST test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the SDS both during testing and the complete vehicle integration tests. 

The SDS must submit positive test reports for all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any issues, such as negative test results or incorrect parameters/processes, the SDS must submit a test report, be present upon request, and provide proposals for solutions to maintain all milestones and targets.

The first sheet of the test report must clearly state whether the result is "OK" or "NOK."

### Analyses and Test Reports
The SDS must provide measurement reports according to VINFAST specification (VFDST00008900) in electronic format, adhering to agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts. After the individual tests, the test samples must be analyzed in detail.

The measurement and test results must be documented with individual values and included in a test report. This report must be handed over to the responsible VINFAST department for release. Upon request, the results, along with the documentation of the tests conducted (e.g., initial sample inspections and inspections performed alongside development), must be submitted to the department responsible for release. Tests during series production must be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.

### Test Report/Information
The test report must include the following:
- **Description/picture of the part:** Documentation must include part number, change index, materials, production process, additives such as grease, and every deviation from the approved serial process.

### Geometrical Integration

#### RPS (Reference Position System):
Testing classification occurs within a functional area. This concept ensures consistent, repeatable, and user-friendly determination of assembly and component parts. A comprehensive RPS approach should be developed during the SE-process for design and quality assurance purposes. The RPS positioning system forms the basis for the function of components and their internal connections and aligns with system VFDST00000011 [28] per interior and BIW department standards.

---

#### Tolerance Analyses: 
The following tolerance analyses are required for single components and complete systems, including BIW and attachment points:

- **Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses**: Ensure precise dimensional measurements.
- **Thermal change tests**: Conduct analyses across varying climate conditions.
- **Thermal expansion**: Test materials and systems with consideration for heat-induced changes.

Arrangements are essential to maintain specified gap dimensions of components.
