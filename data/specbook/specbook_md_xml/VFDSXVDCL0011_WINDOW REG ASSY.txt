5 Description and scope of work.

5.1 Technical requirement.

5.1.1 Project Requirements.

5.1.1.1 Quality Requirements.
Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements.” 

The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability. 

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed. 

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistic specifications, etc.). 

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract. 

Allowing for all of the tolerances which may occur in components and assemblies (BIW door assembly, GRC, Glass attachment), the window regulator assembly must provide a fully functional open and close action for the side door drop glass.  

The components are to be laid out such that the functions in connection with and to the adjacent systems are ensured.  

- The system/the component should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160000 km, whichever comes first.
- Should be designed for high-volume production.
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime.
- Emit no disturbing noises.
- Be fully functional for 36000 open-close cycles for the side door drop glass.
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.

Additional Requirements:
Refer to General Engineering Requirements VinFast.

5.1.1.2 Certification.

- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.
