3 Additional Technical or Functional descriptions.

Battery Management System (BMS) circuits play a fundamental role in charging batteries, ensuring their operation within safe limits, monitoring "state-of-charge" and more.

FPC modules are a part of the BMS. They perform measurements of Voltage and Temperature in each battery module. The design of FPC must withstand harsh conditions, including mechanical shock, vibration, and temperature extremes. It must also conform to the volume of space available within the battery-pack package without compromising the mechanical design or operation of the battery pack itself.

Figures and tables:

1. **Assembly diagram**  
   - The illustration showcases a detailed angular and dimensional breakdown of an FPC model. It highlights specific zones and structural components, including key material designations such as Mylar + TESA 58323 and copper foil bases. Assembly notes are embedded with specifications for critical areas like minimum width, material layering, and QR codes for identification purposes.

2. **Tolerance Table**  
   - This table defines tolerances for dimensions such as center distance (P), L (length), W (width), and D (round diameter).  
   - For center distances:
     - Up to 25: ±0.08  
     - Between 25 and 50: ±0.10  
     - Between 50 and 100: ±0.20  
   - Lengths are categorized with increasing ranges (e.g., L ≤ 100, 100 < L ≤ 200) and corresponding tolerance values such as ±0.5 for smaller lengths and ±2.5 for larger lengths over 800.  
   - Round diameter tolerances are specified for varying ranges, including D ≤ 0.8 and larger precision categories incorporating plated-through-hole diameters.

3. **FPC Connector Specifications**
   - The FPC connector includes definitions for pins J1–J20.  
     - Example definitions:
       - J1–11: NC (No Connection)  
       - J1–12: B1–  
       - J1–13: T2+/T3–  
     - Pin locations are aligned numerically on the connector schematic.  
   - A precise drawing delineates pin layouts and orientation numbering (1 through 11 on one side and 10 through 20 on the opposite side).
