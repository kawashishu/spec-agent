5 Description and Scope of Work.

5.1 Technical Requirement.
This specification establishes the technical cooling module requirements for the BEV electric pump. It must be ensured at all times that VinFast can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

The system developer commits to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process to achieve the project’s purpose. Both technical and commercial releases will be proceeded by the customer in accordance with change management.

For BEV vehicles, thermal management electric pumps are a critical component of the cooling system. The aim of the assignment is to validate an electric pump for the BEV variants, providing support for E-motor cooling, power electronics, and HVAC.

**5.3 Package layout overview:**

Complete vehicle is still under development. Use dimensions provided as reference to confirm technical feasibility and provide initial quotation. More accurate dimensions/envelops will be provided once they are available.

The system designer has to coordinate all components of the module in relation to packaging, function, fixing, and tolerances.

Dimensions shown are for reference, defined based on BEV layout. However, the objective is to design as compact as possible, taking into account the overall low cost and acceptable quality. It is the responsibility of the supplier to confirm the most cost-effective alternative(s) for each variant.

**Figure Descriptions:**

1. The schematic illustrates the packaging overview for BEV systems, including battery loop, EDS & WCC loop, and refrigeration loop. This diagram outlines the integration of components like pumps, chillers, restrainers, exchangers, and heating modules to ensure proper functionality and cooling.

2. The second figure showcases the physical design layout of the module, highlighting critical considerations for dimensions and compact design.
