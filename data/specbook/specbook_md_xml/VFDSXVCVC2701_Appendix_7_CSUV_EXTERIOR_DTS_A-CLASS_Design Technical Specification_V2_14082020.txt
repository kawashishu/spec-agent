INTERFACE HEADLAMP:

This section identifies several headlamp interfaces:

- The primary gap between headlamp components is consistently measured at 1.5 mm in various areas with tolerances specified.
- Larger gaps like 2.5 mm are located near edges and connections to external trim components, ensuring symmetrical alignment.

INTERFACE LAMPS:

This section identifies gap and flush tolerances at specific connection points near lamps:

- Gap tolerances are consistent at 6 mm for all major lamp-trim junctions with tighter tolerances like 1.5 mm for flush alignment.
- Minimal areas like 0.5 mm gaps focus on precision adjustments between lamp and chrome bezels.
