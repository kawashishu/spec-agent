6 Supplier responsibilities.
The supplier is responsible for providing and ensuring requirements while completing the work. These responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements.**  
- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
  The spare parts supplied by the supplier must be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production process.  

- **Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
  The supplier must ensure that the support period of after-sales spare parts fulfills the life cycles of the project and adheres to the requirements in the GTC after VINFAST's end of production of the whole vehicle, unless specified otherwise in the SPB.

- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
  The supplier of the first-level assembly must provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes:
  - BOM table, parts structure, and function description.  
  - Fault diagnosis and special maintenance tools.  
  - Relevant technical parameters, such as installation clearance and parts performance parameters.
