General Description of the System / Component.

It must be ensured at all times that VF can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification are to be agreed between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:
- The part specific requirements.
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of selling markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.

For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, weight, quality, and time schedule.

The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.

Safety requirements that are implemented must comply with all law requirements of selling markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class B and C common platform. VF will also monitor ongoing changes of rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.

The supplier delivers the parts as modules (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated). Add-on parts not included in the development range of the supplier are to be taken into consideration as purchase parts. Add-on parts are: Electrical components and COP parts.

For the documentation of the release, the following sheets and documents are necessary:
- Drawings.
- Simulations (e.g., mold flow analysis).
- Quality regulations.
- Results/documentation of test validation.
- Documentation of the FMEA.

All parts of the assembly must be matched to each other. Functional dimensions must be fulfilled according to the prescription.

<page number="10">
Underbody shields:
- Assist in aerodynamic performance of the vehicle.
- Reduction in external noise transmission to the passenger compartment.
- Reduction in noise transmission from Engine / E Motor to outside, thereby making the whole vehicle quieter.
- Protection of underbody components against stone chipping, water, mud, dirt, etc.

Sound insulations:
The main function of sound insulations is the reduction of drive noise. These parts must retain dimensional stability in a temperature range from -40°C to +85°C.

Measurement of the equivalent absorption area of the engine undershield:
- Measurement is carried out in the Alpha-Cabin with the undershield/carrier in place (if not stated differently). The equivalent absorption area needs to be equal to or higher than the target value.

**Test name:** Alpha Cabin Absorption Coefficient Measurement  
**Standard:** ISO 354-2003

### Thermal Insulation Zone applicable for ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicle only.

#### Thermal Insulation
This section illustrates thermal protection applied to ICE vehicles. It highlights areas within the underbody shield structure where thermal insulation is utilized to safeguard vehicle components from heat generated by the exhaust system. Particular zones are demarcated as red-dotted lines signifying heat-insulated regions.

#### Exhaust and Insulation Details
The image showcases a close-up inspection of exhaust systems with adjacent insulation layers designed to protect vehicle materials. Key highlighted features:
- **Thermal Insulation Zone**: Indicates the focus of heat absorbance mitigating surface temperatures.
- **Aluminum Barrier**: A minimum thickness of 0.25mm aluminum layer is used.

#### Material Composition of Thermal Insulation
- **Core Layer**: Composed of 3mm polyester/wool/fiber glass.
- **Adhesive Backing**: Ensures attachment of the insulation structure.

This configuration ensures effective functionality and endurance against heat-induced impacts on critical vehicle zones.
</page>

<page number="12">
Thermal Insulation Zone is applicable only for ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles. 

### Thermal insulation:
The diagram illustrates the zones where thermal insulation is applied on ICE vehicles. Key highlights include:
- Insulation applied along the exhaust line and underbody sections for heat management.
- Cross-sectional and material composition details emphasize the aluminum layer with a minimum thickness of 0.25mm combined with polyester/wool/fiber glass core for effective heat resistance.

### Thermal Mapping on Under Shield:
This figure presents the thermal mapping distribution on the vehicle underbody shield at varying speeds:
- **40 kph**: Maximum temperature observed is 107°C in specific underbody zones.
- **80 kph**: Maximum temperature reduces to 94°C due to airflow dynamics and thermal dissipation.
- **120 kph**: Heat further diminishes, with a maximum temperature of 82°C distributed along critical insulation zones.

Color-coded temperature gradients provide clarity (as represented in the legend):
- **Blue shades**: Cooler regions.
- **Red zones**: Areas of maximum thermal intensity.
The chart helps visualize thermal performance and underbody component resilience at different driving speeds.

</page>

<page number="18">
The specific requirements of connecting integration modules (e.g. EE brackets) are to be taken into account.

**Acoustics:**  
The sound absorption of the components is defined by the absorption coefficient alpha. The sound insulation of the components is defined by the mass per unit area of the heavy layer (mass), as well as by the dynamic stiffness and damping of the spring. All these values are defined on a component-specific basis and tested. The damping curve is to be achieved with the recommended system.

**Noise immunity:**  
The supplier shall be responsible for ensuring freedom of disturbing noise from contact points in the assembly while also ensuring geometric integration of this interface. The freedom of disturbing noise shall be ensured under all vehicle excitation conditions, under all environmental conditions and over the specified service life. Both virtual as well as hardware verification is to be provided in the form of test reports and presentation to the SE team and the respective I-team at VF.

**Sealing body side:**  
- **Material:**  
  - PE-Foam, 60kg+/-5kg/m³, chemically cross-linked, closed cell.  
  - Preferred to bond sound insulation material to substrate with adhesive/tape.
  
The gas- and water tightness are the basics for acoustical tightness and must be appropriately and sufficiently achieved.

**Homologation Requirements:**  
- *Type Checking and Certification:*  
  General homologation requirements are defined in Part 1 of the component specification book. Examples for the relevant legal requirements for separate technical units, parts, and systems are listed below:

| Item Description      | REG No.     | REG Name             |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| External projections  | UN-R 26_03 | External projections |
| Interior Fittings     | UN-R 21_01 | Interior Fittings    |

**Test Plan**

The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. The plan shows the results in a good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS must deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the component belongs to the SDS. Testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results within the committed schedule. The SDS must ensure that VinFast receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast/SDS.

If testing was done with incorrect parts, missing parts, or a different testing procedure, the testing must be redone at the cost of SDS. In case of negative test results, SDS must re-plan and pay for the retesting if they are responsible for the failure.

### Following Data to Be Included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirement.
- Description of testing set-up with pictures, including how and with which devices the test was performed.
- Responsible test department.
- Information on where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing presented in the form of a project plan.
- Part variant and description of the part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by the VF testing department. Initial data filling must be done by the SDS and submitted to VF (at least 4 weeks after SDS nomination).

The SDS must plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage. The sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.

The test plan must be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SDS. The DVP&R must be agreed upon between the VF test department, SQA (VinFast), and SDS before concept confirmation (Milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. In the event of any scheduling delay, SDS must deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, SDS must draw up a test plan for each single component.

Testing.

General.

The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.17). It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested! 

In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible. Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS have to be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered from VinFast by the SDS.

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

The component developer must assure all relevant legislations for only his component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VF requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VF.

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved. All tests must be documented according to VinFast's standard; alternatively, to SDS standard if this is accepted by VF.

The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification.

The tests have to be brought in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.

Samples for sample inspections are to be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (in coordinated with the test department). Even manual samples can provide sufficient information in certain cases. Measures can thus be introduced in time in the event of assembly problems in order to ensure the install ability of the test parts.

VinFast “Logistics department” determines the number of sample parts, while VinFast “Purchase department” orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

Development parts or partial body structures which are necessary for testing at the SDS must in any case be stated in the quotation of the SDS and must be ordered from VinFast by the SDS.

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS.

CAD data models in compliance with VinFast requirements must be provided in time for virtual sample manufacturing.

Functional Responsibility.

Mechanical properties of components such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety are to be secured through FEM calculations. Tool-dimensioning for injection moulding must be optimized via corresponding simulations. SDS should provide detailed calculation models representing the respective development status to VF technical departments when requested, at no extra cost. These models must ensure proper integration and calculations. Prior to tool dimensioning, SDS evaluations must be calculative-documented (e.g., FEM).

Component Testing.

Basic required tests for components include:
- Climatic change test according to VFDST00008400.
- UV resistance test (VFDST00008600).
- Condensed water test – test atmospheres DINENISO 6270-2.
- Aging of automotive parts DIN 75220.
- Standard atmospheres ISO 554.

Mechanical Integration Tests.

Mechanical integration tests in complete vehicles comprise:
- Climatic change test (VFDST00008400).
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00008600).
- Mounting/dismounting test (VFDST00009000).
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00008500).

Distortion and functional disturbances over the full functional temperature range (-35°, +90°) are not allowed. Materials with varying thermal expansion coefficients must exhibit consistent performance. Tolerances for flush and gap plans after climate tests and sunlight simulations must adhere to acceptable limits.

Binding agreements for these tests are to be made via the DVP, which must be agreed upon between VF, VinFast, and SDS. Additionally, if VinFast orders parts for testing independently, parts must be described in detail. SDS is responsible for supplying free parts needed for testing at VinFast’s test department.

5.2 General CAE Requirements.  
Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL Statement of Requirements (SOR) Specification Book.  

VinFast General FE Modelling and Analysis Requirements.  
Finite Element Modelling Requirements to support VinFast SOR.  

Range of Validity: Project VINFAST.  
The reproduction, distribution, and utilization of this document as well as the communication of its contents to others without express authorization is prohibited. Offenders will be held liable for the payment of damages. All rights reserved in the event of the grant of a patent, utility model, or design. Nothing in this standard supersedes applicable laws and regulations.

5.3 Material Requirement and Corrosion.  
Refer to Table 1 (see section 5.1).  
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  

1. **Corrosivity Low**:  
   Used when the position is **not** affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium**:  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

3. **High Corrosivity**:  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very High Corrosivity**:  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.  

**Material combinations** shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  

- Avoid water and dirt accumulation; always provide drainage in the lowest positions.  
- Avoid dirt traps where sand can act as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements.  
- Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.  
- Edge coverage must ensure burr-free edges and utilize a paint system with good edge coverage.

**Corrosion tests**:
</page>

<page number="25">
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

**Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:**
- **Salt Spray Test:** ISO 9227, acceptance criteria detailed below.

**For Organic Coatings:**
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT):** ISO 11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria detailed below.

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

**Test Criteria:**
| Area                        | Corrosivity               | Metallic Coatings                    | Organic Coatings                     | Pass Criteria                 |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                      | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227               | 96 h → ISO 6270 CH                   | No red rust                  |
| Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, wet area | Medium                  | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227               | 5 cycles CCT → ISO 11997 Cycle B     | NSS: No red rust             |
| High/not visible for customer | High/not visible        | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227               | 10 cycles CCT → ISO 11997 Cycle B    | NSS: No red rust             |
| High/visible, very high      | High/visible, very high | 720 h NSS → ISO 9227               | 10 cycles CCT → ISO 11997 Cycle B + stone chipping protection where needed | CCT: See below              |

**Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT:**
- Rust creep (ISO 4628-8):  
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1-2 mm  
- Blistering:  
  - Blister size: Max S2 (DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  
- Edge corrosion:  
  - ≤ 10%.  
- Weld seam corrosion:  
  - ≤ 5%.  
- Degree of rusting:  
  - ≤ Ri 1 (ISO 4628-3).

**Stainless Steel:**
- Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion); insulating coatings are required in most cases.  

**Test Criteria for High Visible Parts:**
- 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without surface change. Special attention to areas with crevices.  

**Additional Guidelines:**
- Execute component tests with assembled sub-systems, where possible, and in positions as installed on the vehicle.
</page>

<page number="26">
Aluminium parts:  
Aluminium parts in high visible areas have to be painted or anodized.  
Test criteria Painted Aluminium: see test criteria for organic coatings.  
Test criteria Anodized Aluminium: 480h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.  
Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.  

Chromed metal parts:  
240h NSS ISO9227 without base material corrosion.  

Chromed plastic parts:  
CASS-Test according to DIN EN ISO 9227:  
- 48h for Exterior  
- 24h for Interior  

Acceptance criteria: no surface defects.  
Also: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.  

Electric parts:  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (type Gortex), when in wet locations.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes also fasteners and attached brackets.  
Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners etc. that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible to other materials.  
The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  
Terminals, connectors: Don’t place terminals on lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is first of all a requirement for tightness: Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  
Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.  
Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Reason: Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.  

Prevention of stone chipping issues:  
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:  
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
</page>

<page number="27">
Enlarging radii of parts in high risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.

In areas of high stone hitting risk, choose part materials and paint which have the same colour, to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.

Avoid developing parts which have edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.

For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them, so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.

### 5.4 Traceability
For part requirements follow specification please refer to VinFast standard VFDST00010502 and VFDST00010501.

### 5.5 Labeling of Parts
Supplier follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Need to make a figure for position stick labels on parts (position labels set up with pictures).

### 5.6 Vehicle Architecture

#### Vehicle Architecture
The complete vehicle must pass the requirements from the vehicle layout plans. All changes on parts and modules, which are affecting the vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence of the vehicle, have to be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.

The definition and technical geometric specification regarding complete vehicle dimensions in interior and exterior are based on GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.

#### Styling Technique Convergence
All changes on parts and modules, which are affecting the Exterior and/or Interior styling surfaces of the vehicle, have to be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.

Part or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops have to be provided by the supplier (e.g., tooling demands, assembly sequence), based on defined requirements from VF module leads. Technical input can be provided e.g., as office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.

### 5.7 Operational Strength (Stiffness / Strength / Durability)

- Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions (operating loads and special events).
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile.
</page>

<page number="28">
 Definition of all requirements to ensure sufficient operational strength of the complete vehicle, sub-systems, and components (this technical specification forms the basis for all system and component technical specifications).  
 Mounting force must be lower than dismounting force.  

### Operating loads:  
Operating loads are those occurring during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the benchmark base vehicles on tracks defined by VF.  
The definition of customer usage is based on VinFast for MCE (Mixed Circuit Europe = long distance durability run). The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car, which is 160,000km.  
The vehicle lifetime shall be at least 10 years.  

**Environmental operating conditions are:**  
- -30°C to +50°C ambient  
- 0 - 100% relative humidity  
- -100m to 3500m above mean sea level  

### Special events:  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. <100), which are part of the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be designed so that special events do not impact functionality while ensuring that no safety-relevant damages occur, and the intended service life is not reduced.  

### Misuse events:  
Misuse events include those not intended for vehicle usage, e.g., kerbstone impact.  

**The vehicle must be dimensioned to ensure:**  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is retained after misuse (e.g., easily replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages may only appear along with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or neighboring components according to the principle "deformation before break."

### 6 Testing and validation and DVP&R:  
DVP and PC test responsibilities follow RASIC.  

**DVP requirements:**  
- Virtual and physical testing for systems, sub-systems, and component levels must align with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase.  

**Detailed test planning requirements:**  
Testing plans for hardware must be outlined in file DVP&R and coordinated with the Testing & Validation department, including:  
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirements.
