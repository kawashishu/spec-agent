<page number="12">
4.3 Homologation and safety regulation requirements.

4.3.1 North America.  
a. Homologation and safety regulation activities. The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. European, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.

b. Self-certification and test report(s). The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s) or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  

The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  
(*) Refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer_Handbook.  

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations. Despite certifying a product, a supplier may determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier must notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.  

4.3.2 Europe.  
a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.  

b. Test report(s) and Certificate(s).  
The supplier is responsible for ensuring their part(s), product(s), or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products are offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain UN-ECE regulations at authorized technical services. The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  

VinFast also requests the supplier to provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings to be submitted to relevant authorities to get certification for EC vehicle type-approval (if any).
</page>

<page number="13">
The Supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations.  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The Supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.  

**5 Deliverables**

6 Supplier responsibilities.

The supplier is responsible for providing and ensuring the following while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements.**

**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall ensure the life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VinFast's end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VinFast's after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes a BOM table, part structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).

7 Intellectual Property / Copyright.  
Refer to VinFast General Terms and Conditions (GTC).

8 Insurance / Warranties.  
Refer to VinFast General Terms and Conditions (GTC).

9 VinFast GTC & Part Packaging and Incoterms.  
Refer to VinFast General Terms and Conditions, part packaging requirements, and Incoterms requirements from the RFQ package.
