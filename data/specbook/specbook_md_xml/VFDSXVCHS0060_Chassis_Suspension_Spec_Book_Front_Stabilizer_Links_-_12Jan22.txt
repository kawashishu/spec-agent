3.8 **Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.**  
AAR is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is described in the VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing).  
For each step of the process, the supplier is responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design following the agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR approval.  
The process will start in the early phase of PT build to secure AAR approval at LS. The supplier must include this activity in their development process and ED&D cost.  

**Function Safety, Homologation and Safety Regulations.**  
Safety is a key issue in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety is concerned with E/E systems.  

3.9 **Functional Safety Requirements.**

**3.11 Homologation and safety regulation requirements.**

**3.11.1 North America.**

**a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.**
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., European, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.

**b. Self-certification and test report(s).**  
The supplier is responsible for "self-certifying" their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests that suppliers conduct tests, as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.

The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.

(*) Refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer Handbook.

**c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations.**  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The Supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.  

**3.11.2 Europe**

5 Supplier responsibilities.

The supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work to mitigate the risk of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract. 

**Customer service requirements:**
- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup:** The spare parts provided by the supplier must be available at the start of the whole vehicle production.
- **Spare Parts Support Cycle:** The support period for after-sales spare parts should ensure life cycles of the project and meet requirements in GTC after VinFast’s end of production of the vehicle, except as specified in SPB.
- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts:** The supplier of the first-level assembly must provide VinFast’s after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes BOM tables, parts structure and function descriptions, fault diagnosis guides, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters such as installation clearance and part performance details.

6 Intellectual Property / Copyright.

Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).

7 Insurance / Warranties.

Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).

8 VinFast GTC & Part Packaging and Incoterms.

Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition, part packaging requirements, and Incoterms requirements as defined in the RFQ package.
