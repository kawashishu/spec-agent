5.17 Mechanical Requirements.

5.17.1 Load.  
**Operating Loads**  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast. The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.  

**Special Events**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g. ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.  

**Misuse Events**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g. curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned such that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g. steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g. easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations. Either to the same or at neighboring components (principle “deformation before break”).  

5.17.2 Vibration Behavior.  
**NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior**  
The maximum vibration level is to be defined by the supplier (brackets must be developed to avoid resonances below a certain frequency).  
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 35Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VF. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.
