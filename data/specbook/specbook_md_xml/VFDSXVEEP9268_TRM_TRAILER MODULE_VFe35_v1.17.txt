# General Document Guidelines  

## 1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.  
This version is legally binding.  

This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard. Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other. All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g. level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).  

## 1.2 Language  
This document is written in English.  

All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.  

## 1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.  
The following wording rules are used throughout this document:  

- **Shall**  
  The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.  

- **Should**  
  The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.  

- **May**  
  The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

2 General Project Guidelines.

2.1 Development Scope Abstract.
This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the TRAILER MODULE (TRM).  
The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics.  
The Contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements.  
Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details must be reported immediately.  
The contractor is a ‘System Development Supplier’ with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

2.2 Initial Situation and Objective.
The objective is to provide all the necessary technical information requirements to develop a TRM for VinFast cars.

2.3 Classification of the System / Component.
CAN component (intelligent) which is optional / aftersales.  
One variant for the EU market and one variant for the US market. Not offered for the Vietnam market.

2.4 Execution Regulations.
All safety regulations are handled by TRM.  
The supplier must ensure that the developed parts meet the requirements of the laws and the specified requirements of VinFast, obtain the type certification of the parts, and submit all necessary documents to support the type certification of the whole vehicle.  
When synchronous development is completed, suppliers need to provide the necessary documentation to prove that their products have met the required regulatory requirements.

* Following obstructed electric light bulbs/LED will be detected for the trailer-detection functionality:  
   - All outputs (loads)  

At least one of the bulbs/LED recognized above confirms trailer connectivity. Signals are OR-tied up. This state is signaled via:

Precondition: The startup process must have successfully finished.  

**Function conditions for Trailer Detection:**

The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  

(*) Refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer_Handbook.  

c. Duty to notify VinFast of non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations.  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, the supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

7.3.2 Europe

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) regulations.  

b. Test report(s) and certificate(s).  
The supplier is responsible for ensuring their part(s), product(s), or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale.  
VinFast requests the supplier to conduct tests as specified in certain UN-ECE regulations at authorized technical services. The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
VinFast also requests that the supplier provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings, to the relevant authorities to obtain certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any).  
The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.  

c. Duty to notify VinFast of non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations.  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, the supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
