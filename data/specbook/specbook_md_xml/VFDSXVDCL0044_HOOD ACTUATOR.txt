Several validation cycles for electrical systems and functions are planned to guarantee correct implementation and will be carried out according to mentioned standards. The generic Function Release Step (FRS) is outlined in the picture. The detailed timing and description of each FRS is defined in the FRS Plan. The FRS plan has to be fulfilled by every electric component.

### Function Release Step Description

#### Physical testing
For early physical and software testing, Lab Cars, Network Test Bench, and several Subsystem Test Benches will be set up. Parts such as ECUs, sensors, actuators, connectors, etc., shall be delivered free of charge for physical testing (e.g., 12 units for FRS LC2).  

Key electrical tests will be defined to support the road release of test vehicles.  
Generally, all main simulation and testing activities on the vehicle level are outlined in DVP. Tests in supplier responsibility are outlined in respective component/system specifications.  

Engine start needs to be possible after 5 weeks of the vehicle’s non-operative state (idle time).

- Sequential deployment of all components, avoiding pressure peaks and noise, while verifying deployment per component.
- Prevention of any residual pyrotechnic combustion waste classified as hazardous or toxic under respective waste regulations. If residues are categorized as toxic waste, components should be disassembled and handled separately.
- Acoustically and visually traceable deployment feedback for pyrotechnic components directly at vehicles or via tools (e.g., marking deployment locations, including hidden parts like battery clamps or active safety headrests).
- Procedures outlining the non-deployment removal of pyrotechnic components without requiring pre-dismantling. Accessibility of fasteners should remain intact wherever feasible.
</page>

<page number="17">
### 5.1.5.16 Recycling

#### Recycled materials:
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’). Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recycles and post-production recyclers, e.g. recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred with respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert team at VINFAST.

#### Recycling scheme:
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at the end of life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. The recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental experts’ team at VINFAST before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### 5.1.5.17 Geometrical Integration

#### RPS (Reference Position System):
The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. An RPS concept for the design has to be done with quality assurance in the SE process. The RPS determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS system VFDST00000011 [34], according to the interior and BIW department.

#### Tolerance analyses:
Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems, including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms.
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.

#### General Demands
1. **Vehicle safety functions**:
   - Must be maximally prepared at the system level by expertise, CAE, and testing.
2. **Project-relevant supplier data**:
   - Must be handed over to VinFast on request and free of charge. VinFast is permitted to forward this data to other parties within the project.
3. **Target fulfillment**:
   - Performances with spread effects must be secured by an adequate number of test series results considering worst-case scenarios.

Ensure traceability, testing, validation, and compliance for safety-critical components.
</page>

<page number="22">
 Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand, e.g. to support and reach vehicle data freeze milestones. It must be realized within LsDyna, as well as validated, numerical and physically stable.  
 FE meshes must be homogeneous, according to part axes/geometry and with a density of 8-10mm. In case of non-compliance with meshing guidelines, FE meshes must be re-worked.  
 Validated CAE material cards must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier. This includes principle tests on system as well as components.  
 Supplier test matrix must adhere to full vehicle timing demands. Before higher scaled tests such as sled or vehicle crash tests, supplier optimization test series need completion.  
 Supplier-specific parts required for project testing activities must be delivered free of charge to relevant testing facilities. Physical parts and CAE models for supplier needs shall consider costs assumed by the supplier.  
 Integration of requests derived from VinFast full vehicle crash optimization must be accepted without additional costs (e.g., material definitions, material thicknesses, optimization work).  

### General Requirements  
o A mandatory 20% safety margin must be applied to each target value.  
o Occupant survival area integrity, including part behavior and fluids interacting directly and indirectly with passengers.  
o No edges below 3.2mm during and after impact.  
o Electrical system integrity for post-crash functionality.  
o Consideration of relevant tolerances.  
o Robust target achievement.  
o Asymmetries must be studied for each side until the worst case is verified by VinFast.  
o No modifiers for any rating.  

 Additional specific demands are provided.  
o Tracking actions for observed issues, e.g., acquiring parts/data/CAE models/information, must be undertaken by supplier partners.  
o Testing setups like sleds must be based on unfinished parts, e.g., non-prepared BIW sled.  
 When system-level targets are fulfilled, suppliers must prepare homologation and certificate documents, handing over necessary data to VinFast free of charge.  
 Carry-over system requirements fulfillment may be based on donor vehicle performance data.  

**Additional Requirements**  
The supplier must actively support vehicle safety-related functions, integrating lifetime laws, selling market ratings, and OEM requirements. Examples include using CAE and testing expertise or supplying performance-spread test results across identical series. This ensures consistent safety function results and compliance with standards.

<page number="23">
The actuators are one part of the Active Pedestrian Safety System (APSS) and ensure that the hood is in an upright position in time to protect pedestrians in case of impact. The main parameters for the actuators are piston stroke, piston force, and retaining force (refer to Chapter 2.3.3). The force during activation should not be excessively high due to oscillation of the hood and hinges based on high energy input. Conversely, it should not be too low after activation (retaining force) to prevent various dummies from moving down the hood with their body mass before the head impacts the hood.

All components must work properly within the specified temperature and humidity range:
- Temperature: -30°C to +85°C.
- Relative humidity: 10% - 95%.

The supplier must verify, through a sufficient number of hardware tests, that both the activation time and required forces (see 2.3.3) are achieved at the lower boundary, room temperature, and upper boundary of the specified temperature and humidity range. These hardware tests must align with state-of-the-art testing practices such as:
- Usage of a climatic chamber in combination with a fall tower.
- High-speed video capture.
- Measurement of force vs. time and activation height vs. time.

The fixation brackets of the actuators must withstand all activation forces under the specified environmental and thermal conditions without significant elastic or plastic deformation. The supplier must ensure that the hood's "popping up" function remains available even if bracket deformation occurs, e.g., ensuring the piston does not slip off the hinge counterpart throughout the activation and holding process.

The supplier must provide testing components and, if necessary, support activator tuning. They must ensure the participation of specialists during local testing and troubleshooting processes.

### Safety Goals and Functional Safety Requirements
The safety goals and relevant safety requirements, including their assigned Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASIL), must be defined. If the ASIL is not known at the time of supplier selection, conservative assumptions can be made.

**Requirements include:**
- Safety Goals and Functional Safety Requirements and associated attributes.

#### Safety Goal Requirement:
The requirement may specify actions that must not be performed:
- FTTI: An attribute of the safety goal as well as a safe state.
- ASIL: An attribute of the safety goal.

#### System Requirement:
No signal names should appear in the requirement; only physical entities (e.g., speed, acceleration, yaw, etc.), as controlled or perceived by the user of the system, or information entities (e.g., accelerator pedal), should be included when the system is a subsystem of the vehicle.

Systems requirements may already be assigned to subsystems or to the system itself (per ISO definition, as defined in the item definition). FTTI is often inherited from the safety goal and may be decomposed (refer to ASIL decomposition).
</page>

<page number="24">
ASIL: At this stage, decomposition is unlikely but possible if the item is a subsystem interacting with an existing subsystem to mitigate risks. For instance, a distributed safety architecture within the VCU can detect hazardous scenarios, such as excursions in vehicle acceleration, and shut down electric machine torque.
