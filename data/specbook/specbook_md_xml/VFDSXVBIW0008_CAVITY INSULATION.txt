### 3.6 Weight
The vehicle weight significantly influences energy consumption. The primary goal of weight management is to reduce the entire vehicle weight. During development, emphasis must be placed on weight optimization for all components. Suppliers must showcase all weight reduction potentials, including their impact on cost, timing, and quality.

---

### 3.7 Marking of Parts
Development objects must be marked per [VFDST00002200], [VFDST00002300], [VFDST00002400], and [VFDST00002500]. Molded parts should include a manufacturing number or date for manufacturing process traceability. Additionally, development objects must bear a storage period mark in compliance with [VFDST00017200]. Materials must have process reliability for foaming, and the expiry date must be shown on VDA labels attached to KLT containers. Suppliers are required to ensure material durability for at least six weeks post-receipt at VinFast.

---

### 3.8 Installation Space and Clearance
Sealing areas are specified by the Development Department, while their installation positions within the vehicle grid are determined by the manufacturer. The cavity walls' angle for sealing or compartmentalization should not exceed 20°. Pointed sealing areas should be avoided unless otherwise coordinated with the Development Department. Shielding gas arc welding seams must maintain at least 40 mm clearance from molded parts. If violated, a position-specific test is mandatory.

Distances of assembly holes and functional openings must exceed 30 mm to prevent foam filling; if violated, coordination with the Development Department becomes necessary. Circumferential gaps of at least 3 mm around cavity walls must be maintained, enabling pre-treatment liquids and cathodic electro-coating flow through. Modifications of installation space specifications, up to a 5% change during development progress, must align with the PSN project tree and ensure component functionality with adjacent components.

---

### 3.9 Coordinate System
Components must be designed according to the vehicle's coordinate system.

---

### 3.10 Stiffness
The bending and torsional stiffness of individual development components should ensure full operational functionality.
</page>

<page number="12">
### 3.6 Weight
The vehicle weight has a significant influence on energy consumption. Therefore, the primary goal is to minimize the overall vehicle weight. During development, all components must be designed with optimal weight. Suppliers are required to highlight any weight reduction potentials and their impacts on cost, timing, and quality.

### 3.7 Marking of Parts
Parts must be marked in accordance with standards [VFDST00002200], [VFDST00002300], [VFDST00002400], and [VFDST00002500]. Individual molded parts should be traceable through manufacturing numbers or dates associated with their production process. Markings must also include the storage period following the guidelines of [VFDST00017200]. Durability must meet the process reliability requirements, and VDA labels on the KLT containers should indicate the expiry date. The supplier must ensure a minimum durability of 6 weeks from the receipt date at VinFast.

### 3.8 Installation Space and Clearance
Installation space is specified by the Development Department, while precise installation positions are defined by the manufacturer. Sealable cavity angles should not exceed 20°, and sharp sealing areas are to be avoided unless coordinated with the Development Department. Precautions must allow cathodic electro-coating liquids to flow freely, maintaining a gap of at least 3mm between cavity walls. Adjustments to installation space may vary up to 5% during development, and specifications must be verified through the PSN tree of the project. Final designs should ensure compatibility with adjoining components.

### 3.9 Coordinate System
Components must be designed within the vehicle's coordinate system framework.

### 3.10 Stiffness
Components must maintain sufficient stiffness to ensure operational functionality and avoid damage during assembly or servicing activities. Bending and torsional stiffness must be optimized to ensure durability under normal conditions.

### 3.11 Ergonomic Requirements
Ergonomic considerations must ensure assembly workers can operate manual clips throughout a full workday. Any changes to components impacting vehicle layout dimensions must be communicated promptly to the MSF and VinFast for evaluation. Geometric specifications are based on GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.

### 3.12 Acoustics
Fastening methods must eliminate any risk of creaking or interference with adjacent components. Materials and interfaces must prevent interference noises under all operating conditions. Acoustics must comply with [VFDST00069500] regulations for freedom from noise interference and [VFDST00064400] standards for creak, rattle, and audio factors, achieving at least BI 8. Raw materials used in manufacturing must be processed as single-piece components unless otherwise approved. Acoustic sealing must be ensured for all objects passing through the components, with a focus on gap-free transitions and optimized designs for acoustic performance.

<page number="13">
3.13 Technical Cleanliness. To ensure the functionality of the complete system, contamination of the development object shall be avoided.

3.14 Corrosion Resistance. Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC ("VinFast").

3.15 Interfaces. In all tolerance limit positions, the distance to adjacent components determined using the concept of functional dimensions shall be met. The joint air gap between components joined during assembly may not be larger than absolutely necessary for assembly purposes. The joint air gap value determined using the concept of functional dimensions shall be met.

3.16 Method of connection. The type of connection is determined by the manufacturer and the development department. Hole sizes and positions, sheet metal cuts, as well as contact surfaces required for mounting the moulded part and their tolerances, must be submitted to the Development Department by the manufacturer on time (approx. 6 weeks prior to release). 
- The most cost-effective and safest-to-manufacture fastening is to be selected and coordinated with the development department. 
- The manufacturer is responsible for the type of connection and the design of the shape. 
- Mounting is assessed together with Development and Manufacturing. 
- The moulded part with its fastening element must be aligned with the point and clamping plan. 
- The moulded parts must be secured against rotation and loss in the body construction as well as secure against washing out in cleaning and KTL (cathodic electro-coating) baths. 
- Danger of mix-up (left/right vehicle side and position within the vehicle) must be avoided. 
- Holes caused by the mounting method (e.g., clip holes, openings) must be completely sealed with foaming materials. 
- Leaking of swelling material is not permitted in contact areas of passenger compartment trim panels.

3.17 Sealing of bodywork cavities. Moulded parts are used to seal off body cavities. The moulded part design must ensure that the cavity is sealed after expansion. Moulded parts are used for acoustic optimization; however, they may also be used for sealing purposes [VFDST00037401], [VFDST00030601, VFDST00030701]. Molded parts are also used as supporting elements to locally increase the dent resistance of the outer skin.

## Position of Cavity Insulation on BIW
This diagram illustrates the placement of cavity baffles and expanding tapes throughout the Body-In-White (BIW). Each labeled position, ranging from P1 to P9, corresponds to specific parts or insulation points on the vehicle's structure. These positions ensure structural integrity, soundproofing, and thermal insulation.

### Description of BIW Insulation Components:
1. **Cavity Baffles**: 
   These are fixed in pillars such as A, B, C, and D, as well as roof rails, to reduce noise and support rigidity.

2. **Expanding Tapes**:
   These are strategically located on surfaces including wheel arches and shotgun rear areas to seal gaps and improve soundproofing during manufacturing.

### Second View - Highlighted Insulation Components on BIW:
The second image provides a 3D perspective of the BIW, showcasing the integration of cavity baffles and expanding tapes across the vehicle's framework. Each insulation item is marked in blue, emphasizing its precise location and alignment with the designated positions labeled P1 through P9.
