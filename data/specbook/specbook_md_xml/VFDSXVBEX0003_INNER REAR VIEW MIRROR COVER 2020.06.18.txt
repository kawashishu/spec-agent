<page number="14">
### 6.1 Test Plan
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the component lies with the SDS. Testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The SDS must ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast and SDS.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or a different testing procedure, the testing must be redone at the expense of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests must be re-planned, and the retesting must be paid for by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

#### Data Required in the DVP&R:
- **Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirements**.
- **Description of testing setup with pictures**, including the devices used.
- **Responsible test department**.
- **Testing location** (internal/external).
- **Duration and timeline** presented as part of the project plan.
- **Part variants with detailed descriptions**.
- **Number of tested components/parts**.

The SDS is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by the VinFast testing department. The SDS must complete the initial data filling and submit it to VF at least four weeks after nomination. Additionally, the SDS must plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype stage (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

#### Testing Sequence
The sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are determined in coordination with the validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan requires coordination and joint approval by VinFast departments and SDS. The DVP&R must be agreed upon by the test department (VinFast), SQA (VinFast), and SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After milestone CC, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. If there are scheduling delays, the SDS must deliver proposals to meet the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS must draw up a test plan for each single component.

#### Test Plan Example
The test plan must be updated weekly by the supplier, reflecting progress and changes.

6.2 Testing.

6.2.1 General.
The SDS prepares a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.16). It must be ensured that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested. To avoid duplicate testing, mechanical and electrical tests should be combined where possible.

Development parts or partial body structures required for testing at the SDS must be specified in the SDS’s quotation and ordered from VinFast by the SDS. Unless otherwise agreed upon, each sample part delivery must include a measurement report. Additionally, parts required for VinFast test department activities must be provided free of charge.

The component developer must ensure complete compliance with all relevant legislations for their part. They must guarantee fulfillment of VinFast’s internal requirements stated in the performance specification. Documentation of all test results, including photos, must be provided in official test reports and submitted to VF. All Vietnamese legal obligations must be met, and test documentation standards must comply with VinFast standards, or with SDS’s standards if agreed upon.

Testing for the serial development phase must be evaluated and performed by SDS according to the specifications. All tests must be presented in the attached DVP&R template included in the offer.

Sample Inspection.
Samples for inspections must be provided timely, and not later than the agreed date (coordinated with the test department). In cases where manual samples suffice, these may be used to introduce timely corrective measures for assembly problems and ensure the installability of test parts. VinFast Logistics specifies the required number of sample parts, and VinFast Purchase places orders for the parts. Delivery must include a measurement report for each sample part.

Development Parts.
Development parts or partial body structures that are necessary for SDS testing must be explicitly stated in the SDS quotation and ordered by VinFast. The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports and test reports for the latest build level. The testing and inspections must be conducted by SDS.

Virtual CAD Models.
CAD models must comply with VinFast requirements and be delivered in time for virtual sample manufacturing. Form and surface coordination must involve corresponding sample presentations by SDS at VF approval offices, including Cubing reports and Appearance reports (see VF Standard Color Matching / Appearance Approval VFDST00038400).

Matching Parts.
Matching parts must adhere to SDS timing as provided by the matching department and marked according to VF Standard VFDST00008700. These parts must be supplied free of charge by SDS.

6.2.5 Component Testing  
These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VinFast and the SDS, and will be binding.  
- Climatic change test according to VFDST00046100.  
- Sunlight simulation according to VFDST00053800.  

6.2.6 Mechanical Integration Tests  
The following tests will be done as mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle:  
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100).  
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800).  
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000).  
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600).  

Basically, no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range (-35°C to +90°C) are allowed. In particular, by the use of materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients, the behavior must be maintained.  
The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.  

These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VinFast and the SDS, and will be binding.  
If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts must be attached.  
Parts needed for testing activities at the VinFast test department must be provided by the SDS free of charge.  

6.2.7 NVH and Driving Comfort – Complete Vehicle  
**General:**  
The VINFAST target system for Inner Rear View Mirror is orientated on VinFast reference vehicles.  
The system must not cause any kind of disturbing sound (relative movement, squeak and rattle, temperature, flexural torsion, etc.) during any operation. All possible appropriate measures must be taken to prevent operating noises completely or absorb/deaden them to the greatest extent possible to achieve acceptable noises.  

Squeak and rattle (S&R) effects which may occur when high-speed driving of the vehicle, also particularly at certain humidity levels, must be avoided by means of a suitable profile design and by choosing the right surface coating process of an appropriately high-quality material pairing (material matching) that offers adequate durability too. The NVH team may assist with choosing the material pairing because of buzzing, squeak, and rattle noise generation.  

To evidence the disturbing noise freedom, the requirements have to be coordinated with the responsible "VF" NVH-testing team.  

**Natural Frequency:**

6.2.5 Component Testing.

These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VinFast and the SDS, and will be binding:
- Climatic change test according to VFDST00046100.
- Sunlight simulation as per VFDST00053800.

6.2.6 Mechanical Integration Tests.

The following tests will be conducted as mechanical integration tests within a complete vehicle:
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100).
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800).
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000).
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600).

Basically, no distortion and no functional disturbance throughout the entire functional temperature range (-35°, +90°) are allowed. Especially for materials with varying thermal expansion coefficients, behavior must remain consistent. The tolerances for flush and gap plans must meet specifications following the climate test and sun simulation with no exceedance.

These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP, which must be agreed upon by VinFast and the SDS. If VinFast orders parts for testing independently, parts must be detailed appropriately and provided by the SDS free of charge.

6.2.7 NVH and Driving Comfort – Complete Vehicle.

**General:**
The VinFast target system for the Inner Rear View Mirror is based on VinFast reference vehicles. The system must not produce any disturbing noises, such as relative movement-induced sounds, squeaks, rattles, or noises from temperature and flexural torsion. Suitable measures must be implemented to completely eliminate or deaden noises, ensuring acceptable output.

Squeak and rattle (S&R) effects, especially under high-speed driving conditions and at certain humidity levels, must be eliminated through optimized profile design and proper surface coating. Material pairing decisions must ensure durability and avoid buzzing and rattle noises. Additionally, NVH requirements, including natural frequency assessments, are set to guarantee vibration-free operation. Coordination with the "VF NVH-testing team" is required.

**Natural frequency:**
- Glass right > 63Hz.
- Glass center bottom > 63Hz.

**Legend for frequency measurements:**
- Sensor position (red).
- Impulse hammer contact position (black).
- Measurement and excitation points recorded at glass surface sections, specifically in the x-direction:
    - Inner mirror glass - right.
    - Inner mirror glass - center bottom.

**Supplier Guaranties:**
- No noticeable vibrations of the inner mirror leading to blurry images.
- Avoidance of noise due to unfavorable tolerance impacts on functional components or joints.
- Elimination of squeak and rattle effects from mirror movements during any driving scenarios.
- Full operational capability across a range of temperature and humidity conditions.

6.2.8 Vehicle Safety.

**Cooperation with VinFast Vehicle Safety Department:**
The supplier is responsible for actively supporting the integration of vehicle safety functions. All lifetime-relevant laws, market-specific safety ratings, and OEM requirements must be observed.

**General Demands:**
Suppliers must adhere to the following:
- Vehicle safety functions must be maximized at the system level through CAE expertise and testing.
- Relevant project data from the supplier must be provided to VF upon request and free of charge. VF has the discretion to share this information with other project stakeholders.

<page number="20">
> Target fulfilment of performances with spread effects must be secured by an adequate number of worst results of identical test series’ results.  
> Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand, e.g., to support and reach vehicle data freeze milestones. It must be realized within LsDyna, as well as validated, numerical and physically stable.  
> FE meshes must be homogeneous, according to part axles/geometry and with a density of 8–10mm. In case of non-compliant meshing guidelines, FE meshes must be re-worked. On-demand further information from VF regarding CAE model set-up will be provided, e.g., numbering conventions.  
> For generating validated CAE material cards, activities must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier. This includes principal tests on systems as well as components.  
> Supplier test matrix must be defined according to full vehicle timing demands; before higher-scaled tests are planned (e.g., sled or vehicle crash tests), supplier optimization test series must be completed.  
> Supplier-specific parts needed for testing activities at any party of the project must be provided by the supplier free of charge to the relevant testing facilities. However, in case of upcoming costs for physical parts and CAE models needed by the supplier, costs must be taken into account by the supplier.  
> Integration of requests from the full vehicle crash optimization process at VF must be accepted without add-on costs; e.g., material definitions, material thicknesses, additional parts, and optimization work.  

> General requirements:  
• For each single target value, a mandatory 20% safety margin has to be applied.  
• Occupant survival area integrity versus part behavior and fluids:  
  - This includes parts that are directly and not directly in contact with any passengers.  
• No edges below 3.2mm during and after impact.  
• Electrical system integrity during impact and for post-crash functions.  
• Consideration of relevant tolerances.  
• Robust target achievement.  
• Asymmetries must be investigated on each side until a reliable worst case is confirmed by VF.  
• No modifiers for any Rating.

> Additionally to general demands, specific demands are given:  
• Without claim to be complete.  
• Any tracking actions of concerned parties for observed issues must be done:  
  - e.g., obtain parts/data/CAE models/information from further suppliers.  
• Any devices, such as test bucks/sleds/etc., must be set up by the supplier, based on unfinished parts:  
  - e.g., a non-prepared BIW to be used finally as a sled.  

> For targets totally or partly fulfilled on system level, the supplier has to prepare homologation and/or certificate documents. Data has to be handed over to VF free of charge.  
> In case of carry-over parts/systems, fulfillment of system requirements can be shown by donor vehicle performance data.
