**General Items**

1. This specification is an additional document for the manufacturing plant and is for information only.
2. The Engineering Data must be referred to for the exact position and length of all products.
3. The process specification should only be revised if there is a change in product or a new application is required.
4. The indicated quantities of adhesive refer to the entire component, with a tolerance of ±20%. This is due to actual application on panel and can be different than predicted. Once the vehicle is in production, then actual dimensions and weight can be accurately measured.
5. Weight calculations for BIW sealer/adhesive are based on nominal bead sizes for each application; actual weights may vary from predicted.
