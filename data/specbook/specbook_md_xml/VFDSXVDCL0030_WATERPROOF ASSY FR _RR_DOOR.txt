Volatile organic compounds of components must be checked according to ISO12219. The conformance to prohibited substances must be ensured through the complete product life cycle.
</page>

<page number="15">
5.1.5.13 Emissions & Toxicology  
Harmful substances in components and materials.  
Volatile organic compounds of components have to be checked according to ISO12219. The conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured through the complete product life cycle. The test result is evaluated by the specialist department of VinFast. In any case, the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health has to be attested in written form on demand. The supplier has to provide measurement results regarding VOC and Fogging for the materials before the milestone purchase release.

5.1.5.14 Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization  
To ensure a cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:  
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks/check of deployment per component).  
- After deployment of the pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that shall be classified, acc. to the status of the respectively valid waste legislation, as toxic waste or hazardous substances (otherwise the components shall be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances).  
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle/via the feedback at the deployment tool).  
- Marking of positions of pyrotechnical components (especially “hidden” components, e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest).  
- In case of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is required. In this case, pre-dismantling, if technically possible, shall be avoided (accessibility of fasteners).  

5.1.5.15 Recycling  
**Recycled Materials:**  
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called "proven recycling technologies"). Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recycles and post-production recyclers, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to environmental compliance expert’s team at VINFAST.  

**Recycling Scheme:**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor must show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling scheme must be provided to environmental experts’ team at VINFAST before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

5.1.5.16 Geometrical Integration  
RPS (reference position system): The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. An RPS-concept for the design has to be done with quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS-system VFDST00000011 [34] according to interior- and BIW-department.

**Tolerance analyses:** Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems, including BIW and attachment points:  
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses  
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms  
- Thermal expansion has to be considered

### 5.3 Material Requirement  
The VINFAST environmental compatibility requirements must be met.  

Supplier must use materials approved by VINFAST product center design engineer if material standards are defined for materials used in parts.  
Where there is no specified material standard for the materials used on the parts, the supplier may select the materials according to the design, durability, and performance requirements of the parts and be responsible for the performance of the assembly.  

Supplier shall provide VINFAST's product center with a list of materials for individual parts that have been shattered.
