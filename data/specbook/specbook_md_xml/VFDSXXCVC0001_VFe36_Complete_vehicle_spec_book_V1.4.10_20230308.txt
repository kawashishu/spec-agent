VFe36_VTS_V2.

In the component performance specifications, it is defined how and with which means the requirements are to be implemented. The requirements in the VTS are broken down into subsystems.
</page>

<page number="9">
3.7 Variant Management.  
VFe36 will be developed for VN (Vietnam), NA: North America (US: United States, CA: Canada), and EU (Europe) markets.  
The project will include the development of Left Hand Drive (LHD) versions only. Right Hand Drive versions shall be considered as package protected only.  

3.8 Change Management.  
Regarding engineering and development, changes to this and other technical specifications are only valid if they have been evaluated, agreed, and documented by VinFast.  

3.9 General Development and Supply Scope.  
The main supplier obligations are described in the work interface chart (RASI).  

The status of the supplier “Built to Print_B2P” or “Full Service Supplier_FSS” is defined in the Sub-System Technical Specification - SSTS.  

RASI is defined as follows:  

**R:** Responsible.  
Responsible for proper execution of the activities to fulfill the requirements. The responsible party is entitled to drive the work scope and request the necessary support from other project team members.  

**A:** Approval.  
Obligation to decide/responsible for release. If no Approval party is defined, the Responsible party will be the Approval party as well.  

**S:** Support.  
The support party is obligated to actively support (even if this requires capacity, expenses, and/or transfer of know-how). This project team member must proactively assist the person responsible for execution R in achieving the targets.  

**I:** Information.  
Right to information. This team member is entitled to demand information from any other party.  

**Work Interface Chart (RASI) – VinFast**  
R = Responsible, A = Approval, S = Support, I = Information.  

**For all CVC level or subjective level evaluations, use the scaling index below:**  

10 - OUTSTANDING.  
Technical solutions are surprisingly positive.  

9 - EXCELLENT.  
Technical solutions are convincing.  

8 - VERY GOOD.  
Vehicle generates satisfaction; expectations completely fulfilled.  

7 - GOOD.  
Vehicle irritates in singular/rare cases; small deviations from target are detectable.  

6 - SATISFYING.  
Vehicle does not fulfill expectations completely (sensibilization onto failures).  

5 - NOT ACCEPTABLE.  
Vehicle generates dissatisfaction; failure will be reported during garage work, not an acceptable borderline case.  

4 - FAULTY.  
Vehicle generates disappointment; failure leads to unplanned garage work.  

3 - UNSUFFICIENT.  
Vehicle generates uncertainty; leads to annoyance, garage will be visited immediately, technical solutions are insufficient.  

2 - BREAKDOWN.  
Vehicle generates extreme annoyance (i.e., breakdown); legal claims or publication is imminent.  

1 - SAFETY RISK.  
Vehicle has a safety risk; failure represents a safety risk for the driver or surroundings, homologation-relevant item.

5.7.3 NVH and Driving Comfort.  

The NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness), Acoustics and Driving Comfort target system is based on VinFast’s vision and the agreed Customer Market Profile.  

Interior Noise and Vibration.  
According to VinFast’s vision, NVH is a very important vehicle characteristic. The vehicle shall enable very good noise and vibration comfort balanced with vehicle dynamics and drivability.  

- Wind noise and road noise will be balanced to ensure long-distance driving comfort and driving over rough or concrete roads will neither be exhausting nor annoying. This requires freedom from squeaks and rattles under all load cases and the avoidance of error states caused by wind or road high-frequency or tonal noise.  
- Road noise is optimized through a high-level sound package and high attachment stiffness.  
- Wind noise will not be disturbed under driving conditions due to good insulation and low air leakage levels.  

Powertrain NVH Attribute.  
When powertrain performance is demanded, the sound will convey strength, power, and responsiveness. The E-powertrain will be free of annoying tonal noises, and sound levels are expected to increase linearly with vehicle speed.  

Vehicle Sensitivity.  
Optimized through design iterations to achieve BIW stiffness, local dynamic stiffness, and noise/vibration transfer functions. This ensures class-leading quietness and noise levels.

Exterior Noise.  
Signature sound must meet both marketing expectations (e.g., "Spaceship-like sound") and homologation requirements.  

The following requirements must also be met:  
- Pass-by noise (EU: ECE R51; US/CA: CMVSS 1106; VN: Article 2.29 QCVN 09:2015/BGTVT).  
- Horn noise (EU: ECE R28; VN: Article 2.26 QCVN 09:2015/BGTVT).  
- AVAS noise (EU: ECE R138; US/CA: FMVSS 141).

Reported Complete Vehicle NVH and Driving Comfort Targets:  
- Subjective NVH evaluation: Interior noise, vibrations on contact points, acoustic quality incl. S&R.  
- Powertrain noise and vibration.  
- Wind noise.  
- Road noise.  
- Interior noise.  
- Squeak & Rattle.  
- Objective vibration levels on contact points (steering wheel and seat rail).  
- Local/global dynamic stiffness of BIW / TB (Body in White / Trimmed Body).  
- Pass-by and horn noise (homologation relevant).  
- Audio acoustic balancing.  
- Operational sound quality.  
- Climate Control NVH.  
- Air Leakage.  

All target values, especially subjective rating targets, are related to reference measurements with benchmark vehicles. Targets are outlined in the Complete Vehicle Target Catalogue.

### Supplier Responsibilities  
The supplier is required to carry out issue resolution for its components, including any failure of the attachment elements (e.g., bolts).  

---

### 5.7.5.2 Basic Dimensioning of Complete Vehicle, Systems, and Components  

#### Operating Loads  
- Operating loads occur during the intended use of the vehicle and are derived from measurements with benchmark vehicles available under Program VTS - Stiffness, Strength, and Durability.  
- Road Load Data Acquisition (RLDA) according to market standards is used to develop data for special road regions, serving as input for structural durability tests.  
- Load cases used during development follow standards and best practices for CAE analysis.  

#### Mileage for Testing  
- The tested mileage corresponds to 160,000 kilometers of normal customer driving.  
- Safety-relevant components require additional safety factors depending on material and loading type.  
- Special cases may involve validation through simulations following internal project agreements, considering sufficient safety factors.  
- Approval on a complete vehicle level will be conducted on relevant test tracks such as rough road durability runs, lateral force durability runs, and on-road durability runs.  

#### Testing Requirements  
- Testing targets follow these principles:
  - 50% damage-free testing.
  - 100% testing with no damage for safety and function relevance.
  - Testing at 150% to identify weak spots.
- Safety-relevant modules like chassis have extended requirements.

---

#### Special Events  
- Special events are occurrences with low frequency (<100) that fall under intended vehicle use (e.g., ABS braking).  
- Vehicles must be dimensioned to ensure the following:  
  - Special events do not affect functionality, and no safety-relevant damages occur.  
  - Intended service life remains unaffected.

---

#### Misuse Events  
- Misuse events include actions outside normal vehicle usage (e.g., curbstone impacts).  
- Vehicles must meet these requirements:  
  - Damages after misuse must be clearly recognizable by drivers (e.g., inclined steering wheel or wheel conditions).  
  - A defined damage chain must be maintained after misuse (e.g., easily replaceable parts fail before body structure issues).  
  - Cracks or damages should occur only alongside clearly recognizable plastic deformation, either within the same component or neighboring ones ("deformation before break").

---

### 5.7.5.3 Operational Strength Testing Relevant to Vehicle Testing  

#### Testing Standards  
The testing will follow VinFast testing standards.  

---

#### Vehicle Durability Testing  
- **Mileage Target Life**: 160,000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first).  
- **Structural Durability Test**: Use RLDA data on a 24 DoF MTS 329 machine according to market standards.

### 5.7.8.1 General Scope  

Vehicle Dynamics and Driving Performance are important vehicle characteristics. The vehicle shall enable a comfort which is well balanced with vehicle dynamics and drivability. Consequently, global BIW stiffness’s and local stiffness’s at chassis and powertrain attachment points are highly critical to create a robust vehicle concept. Static & dynamic connection stiffness regarding chassis links and subframe to body in white should be the same as for the vehicle. Body in white torsion and bending stiffness must be the same as the vehicle. Also, a good alignment with aerodynamics will enable the desired level of lift at front and rear axle up to top speed.  

### 5.7.8.1.1 Linear Range Handling  

The following paragraph specifies the required handling characteristics of the vehicle during that portion of vehicle maneuvering where the vehicle’s lateral acceleration response to increasing steering wheel angle (SWA) is linear (i.e., the vehicle steering sensitivity is close to constant). Linear range handling requirements are derived from Constant Radius Cornering test (CRC).

Linear Range Handling requirements are derived from **Constant Radius Cornering test (CRC)**. These specify handling characteristics based on steady-state lateral acceleration changes concerning steering wheel angle.

#### Understeer Gradient  
During vehicle maneuvers where lateral acceleration response to steering wheel angle is not linearly proportional, the understeer gradient values are as follows:  

| Requirement Suffix | Understeer Gradient (deg/g) | Loading Condition | ECO/PLUS Suspension | Sporty Suspension |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| a                   | 1.8-2.5                    | D+E               | 2.0-2.5             |

*Current VTS defined; confirmation to occur during physical vehicle testing.*

---

#### Roll Gradient  
The rate of change in vehicle roll angle with steady-state lateral acceleration, derived from CRC at 0.3g, must adhere to the following table:  

| Requirement Suffix | Roll Gradient (deg/g) | Vehicle Loading | ECO/PLUS Suspension | Sporty Suspension |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| a                   | ≤5.0                 | D+E             | <4.5                |

*Current VTS defined; confirmation to occur during physical vehicle testing.*

The concept prioritizes enabling foot well heating for the 1st seat row, with an optional outlet in the center console for the 2nd seat row. These outlets are connected to the front HVAC system, and their performance depends on the settings of the first row. 

All thermal comfort features are detailed in the feature lists located in Appendix 3. Both subjective and objective complete vehicle targets regarding in-vehicle thermal comfort are outlined in the VTS. 

The air extraction mechanism is positioned at the rear end of the passenger cell, enhancing acoustic performance by using sound absorbers and extending the length of the air noise path.

The supplier's climate control unit must feature basic functions for HVAC control and provide initial calibration for subsequent optimization.

HVAC function components must adhere to specified functional requirements, confirmed through documented measurements by suppliers ensuring tolerance compliance. Validation tests for the HVAC system must follow VF standards.

### Development Strategy for the HVAC System:
- Conduct CFD simulations to evaluate vent, foot, defrost, air intake performance, focusing on air distribution, mass flow, vent filling, pressure loss, and climate comfort optimization.
- Perform final HVAC system tests under normal climate conditions (10°C to 25°C), hot weather (25°C to 40°C), and cold winter conditions (0°C to 10°C) in PTO.

### 5.7.12 In-Vehicle Thermal Comfort 

The in-vehicle thermal comfort and defrost/demist concept will be developed to fulfill the objectives described by PALS, as shown in Appendix 2. Consequently, the concept will focus on enabling footwell heating for the first seat row. For the second seat row, there will be an outlet in the center console (optional). These outlets are connected to the front HVAC system, which gets the temperatures and airflow from there, so their controlling depends on the setting of the first row.

All thermal comfort relevant features are outlined in the feature lists, see Appendix 3. The subjective and objective complete vehicle targets with regard to in-vehicle thermal comfort are outlined in the VTS. Air extraction will be implemented at the rear end of the passenger cell, aiming to minimize the acoustic impact by adding sound absorbers and increasing the length of this air-borne noise path.

The climate control unit that the supplier provides must include the main functions for the control of the HVAC system and come with a basic calibration to facilitate optimization.

#### Development Strategy for the HVAC System

- CFD simulations will be conducted to assess vent, foot, defrost, and air intake configurations. These simulations will review air distribution, mass flow, vent filling, and pressure loss. Additional simulation loops will optimize climate comfort and acoustics parts.
- Final tests and definition of HVAC parameters will account for normal climate weather conditions (10°C to 25°C), hot climate weather conditions (25°C to 40°C), and additional applications for cold, winter weather conditions (0°C to 10°C) performed in PTO.

### 5.7.12.1 Air Ducts and Distribution Water Tightness Requirements

During water tightness tests performed at the complete vehicle level in a rain chamber, the following requirements must be met:
- No water ingress at the intake of the air climatization.
- No water ingress into the passenger compartment.
- No droplets noticeable on the particle filter due to water spray.

Fresh air paths to the HVAC must avoid air leakage against air entering from the engine compartment under specified test conditions. Smoke generators, soapy water bubbles, or other methods will ensure leak-free joint lines and sealing lines.

### 5.7.12.2 Ventilation Outlets 

Ventilation outlets must demonstrate functionality and operability for air stream distribution, propagation, and adjustability to:
- Provide immediate cooling.
- Enhance climate comfort.
- Prevent screen fogging while avoiding disruptive airflow effects.

Subjective ratings should reach at least "satisfactory" and meet objective targets per the specification sheets for ducts, outlets, and grills.

#### Heating Outlets in the Footwell Area 

Heating outlets must produce even heated airflow across the footwell area, avoiding hot spots or cold air impacts. This ensures quick heating and steady-state climate comfort for all passengers.

#### Defrost Outlets 

Defrost outlets must direct heated air onto the windshield and front side screens. Large screen areas must defrost or demist quickly and reliably while maintaining mist-free operation during normal car use. Compliance with Regulation (EU) No 672/2010 for BEV is required.

### 5.7.12.3 Absence of Air Draught for Optimal Climate Comfort 

Climate comfort tests must ensure HVAC system adjustments can achieve an AI (assessment index) of "NEUTRAL" (+/- 1) under typical driving and ambient conditions. 

Additional requirements include:
- Passenger compartment temperature stratification within tolerances.
- Coziness assessment in extreme climate regions performed by a nominated team under controlled conditions.

Specifications:
- Air pressure must increase by at least 125Pa at a fresh air amount of 100SCFM delivered by the HVAC system with rear air extractors tightly closed. 
- Verification of sufficient cross-sectional equivalency during tightness checks is required.

Air pressure drop characteristics must be finely tuned throughout the vehicle to meet specifications. Swing-free closure of doors and trunk lid must not cause disturbing pressure peaks.

### 5.7.12.5 Recirculation Air and Rear Air Extraction 

Symmetrical distribution of extracted air via passages in footwell insulation panels (for recirculation) and rear panels (for air extraction) must be achieved. This avoids noticeable pressure increases while maintaining temperature and comfort assessments under various driving and climatic conditions.

### 5.7.12.6 Mass Flow and Distribution of Conditioned Air 

Mass flow distribution primarily depends on the HVAC system's capacity.

### 5.7.12.7 Temperature Distribution and Control  

The HVAC system must ensure reproducible delivery of conditioned air with consistent temperature and mass flow according to settings while maintaining minimal deviations.

#### Temperature Control Characteristics  

Under steady driving conditions, outlet temperatures must closely align with control settings, regardless of adjustment approaches to new settings.

#### Temperature Stratification  

A stable and comfortable temperature balance must be achieved between heated and footwell areas in steady-state conditions. HVAC should avoid additional stratification functions.

o Adjustment of the blower speed characteristics.
o Cooling air flow through the condenser.
o Determination of the optimum charge of lubricant.
o Evaluation of the appropriate position of the dryer/filter bottle and of the charge air cooler.
o Establishment of the climate compressor torque consumption characteristics.

### Determination of the optimal charge of refrigerant
The optimal charge ensures a proper effect of the refrigerant circuit for as long as possible. This amount of refrigerant is just a little less than the limit of overfill. An overfilling with refrigerant causes a significant increase of the pressure and the peak temperature at the high-pressure side. The limits of the safety devices can be reached and an A/C cut-off will be the consequence.

### Passive heat up
The vehicle must not suffer from too high temperatures in the passenger compartment even when parked in hot ambient and at high solar radiation. This passive heat-up inside the passenger compartment has to be minimized to an acceptable level by appropriate heat insulation of the roof and solar radiation protection for the screens by optimized geometry (sizes and angles) and thermal properties of the glass.

### Maximum cool down
Passengers should get convenient cooling as fast as possible after the start of the vehicle when heated up in the sun. To demonstrate the cooling capacity of the system, the passenger compartment must be cooled immediately by sufficient air of corresponding low temperature.

### Operation reliability under extreme ambient and operation conditions
Even with extreme hot ambient temperatures, the A/C system has to show sufficient cooling function.

### Adjustment of the blower speed characteristics
Good system efficiency requires sufficient cooling air drawn through the condenser, which is only possible with optimized cooling fan speed characteristics.

### Cooling air flow through the condenser
The HVAC system efficiency has to be ensured by uniform supply of cool fresh air to the whole surface of the condenser.

### Determination of the optimum charge of lubricant
The supplier of the A/C compressor shall establish the necessary amount of lubricant. The lubrication...

6 Complete Vehicle Testing – DVP  
The testing phase is structured in these phases:  
- EP  
- PTO  
- PP  

The Mule vehicle testing will focus on chassis, powertrain, and thermal system tests as well as load spectrum measurements for BIW durability evaluations. In addition to testing drivable vehicles, partial build-ups will be produced to serve the needs of vehicle structure validation.  

Tests for ensuring target fulfillment will be carried out using complete vehicle/vehicles of the PPV. Powertrain and thermal test bench testing are also the responsibility of VF.  

System and component tests are the responsibility of the suppliers, which includes tests conducted by their sub-contractors.  

The complete Design & Verification Plan (DVP) covering all complete vehicle functions is shown in DVP appendix 12.

7 Reporting and Documentation  

7.1 Information Exchange  
To reduce emails and enable proper communication, VF has set up a data exchange server to share documents such as meeting minutes, work reports, planning documentation, testing documentation, styling feedback, specifications, etc.  

CAD data shall be exchanged via Teamcenter or Supplier Collaboration.

---

7.2 Documentation and Archiving Obligations  
Description is provided without archiving obligation information.

---

7.3 Priority and Up-to-Datedness of Documents  
This document details the complete vehicle functions and performance. Additional specifics regarding design are included in CAD data or supplementary applicable documents.
</page>

<page number="67">
Generally, in case of contradictory statements in specifications or other documents, the released drawings have higher priority. Discrepancies have to be clarified immediately upon occurrence and documented appropriately to ensure a stable clarification.

**General document priority (1 = highest priority):**
1. Legal Requirements.
2. Contractual agreements.
3. Drawings, 3D models, and the project-specific functional dimension catalog.
4. System and Component Specifications.
5. Standards VinFast / International.
6. Other specification books which will be quoted with further applicable documents.
7. Internal technical regulations which will be quoted with further applicable documents and other general terms and conditions.
8. National and international norms and standards (DIN, EN, ISO, etc.) which will be quoted with further applicable documents.

### 7.4 Change documentation and Part History documentation
VinFast has set up criteria and a change management process (see also chapter 3.8) to enable an efficient handling, documentation, and confirmation of changes with the involved parties (VinFast / Suppliers Tier 1-x). The goal is to evaluate each change request’s impact on product and program targets, quality, timing, and product cost.

Suppliers are required to collaborate throughout the concept and serial development phases within this change management process. Specifically:
- Suppliers have to implement confirmed changes.
- Suppliers must confirm to VinFast, in written notice, any impact on the project/program within 3 weeks.
- Suppliers must provide data in a format defined by VinFast to ensure proper documentation of changes during development and production phases (e.g., entries in a project manual).

Change requests within a supplier’s development scope having an impact on cost, timing, or quality will be handled through claim management and can only be confirmed by purchasing.

### 7.5 Vehicle documentation
All complete vehicle buildups will be documented using the PRODAP system (PRODuction Applications Platform). This database will include vehicle-specific documentation such as:
1. Actual build condition.
2. Variable product data (e.g., engine serial number, gearbox serial number, etc.).
3. Checklists for all relevant screw torques.
4. Executed rework.
5. Reporting of all gathered data.

Systems or parts fulfilling safety regulations from VinFast or legal requirements must have a remark on the drawing. VinFast will provide documentation listing reasons and characteristics to be documented.

### 7.6 Traceability
All parts delivered to customers must be clearly traceable via proper identification marking when relevant for declared traceability. A clear concept for traceability will be provided.
