AAR is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is described in the VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing). For each step of the process, the supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval. The process will start in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS. The supplier has to include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.

**4.3.1 North America**

**a. Homologation and safety regulation activities:**  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., European, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.  

**b. Self-certification and test report(s):**  
The supplier is responsible for "self-certifying" their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before these products can be offered for sale.  
VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that U.S./Canada governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS (refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer Handbook).

**c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance:**  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The supplier must propose appropriate risk assessment and a resolution plan.

6 Supplier responsibilities.

The supplier is responsible for providing/ensuring compliance while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements.**

**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.
