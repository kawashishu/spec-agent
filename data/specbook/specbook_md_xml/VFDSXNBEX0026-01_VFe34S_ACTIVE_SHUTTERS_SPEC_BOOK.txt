3 Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions.

The frame shall be assembled with active vanes which are carry-over parts from the VF35 program of VinFast. Therefore, the component shall be designed in a way that the existing components can be assembled with the frame. All functions implemented in the existing VF35 vehicle must also be available in the VFe34S vehicle. This means that in the area of the part where the vanes (flaps) are located, only limited changes are allowed. Any changes in this area must be aligned with VinFast and announced and aligned before supplier nomination.

Part of the validation may be carried over from the VF35 program (leakage simulation, air flow, etc.). However, simulation reports from the VF35 program must be available. If the results are not available, a new simulation shall be conducted for:
- Air leakage.
- Air flap blockage.
- Air flap torsion and durability.
- Active shutters lower frame torsion and durability.

This system is used for all vehicles and markets (Active Shutters Frame assembly with carry-over parts). This variant represents the fully assembled and fully functional active grill shutters, including flaps, an actuator, and coupling bars. All parts necessary for the full functionality of the grill shutters and not included in this specification must be carried over from the VF35 program. The supplier shall deliver the fully assembled component, which includes all necessary quality checks during assembly and an end-of-line test for the assembled component.

General:
The development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies shall be optimized to avoid defects and ensure reliability. At the time of delivery and over the average service life, no complaints (zero faults) should occur.

Overall function:

Development targets:
- Prevention of functional and quality problems out of known systems.
- Use of standard and common parts if possible or reasonable.
- Process reliability at production, packaging, transport, and assembly.
- Minimize effort of overall production sequence: production, packaging, transport, and assembly track side.
- Prevention of displacement.
- Integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of the part package (Simultaneous Engineering) from the concept phase onward. Early inclusion of the developers of neighboring components.
- General reduction of cost compared to predecessor models.
- Further improvement of the optical and functional characteristics.
- Functionality has to be ensured within requested temperature range.

Air entrance front opening/closing:

The function of the air flap control is sealing the cooling air inlet in the vehicle front and selectively opening it demand-oriented for cooling air. With a closed system, the cx value of the vehicle is significantly reduced.  
For this purpose, it shall be ensured that the air flaps can be set in specific positions given by the VF department.  
All flaps will open and close at the same time. Independent operation of certain flaps is not needed.

Stiffness / Rigidity / Stability of shape:
- Especially in the area of the operating elements, the components and bracket design have to assure that no instability is noticeable.
- Irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, visible waviness under climatic change loads are prohibited.
- The influence of the components regarding the pedestrian protection’s requirements in the front end must be aligned with VF departments.
- The components shall be designed so that under all conditions of use (during assembly, delivery, varnishing, and production) no permanent deformations arise. It must be ensured that the air flaps do not start fluttering in any operating condition.

Product characteristics:
- The components of the active grille must be designed in consideration of all tolerances of parts and assemblies, including heat extension.
- The function of the component must be proven in consideration of all existing tolerances, including heat extension.
- The material-specific thermal expansions have to be considered during the definition of gap tolerances.
