2 Definitions and applicable documents.

2.1 CAD Data/Transfer data-CAD Requirements.  
All CAD data must be designed with CATIA V5 following VF standard VFDST00000014. CAD data transfer from VinFast to the supplier will be done through the Supplier collaborative module. For more details, refer to the Supplier collaborative module in the RFQ package.

2.2 Change Documentation and Part History Documentation.  
During the development and production process, all changes within the framework of the contract must be documented and provided to VinFast and OEM/Supplier by the contractor (e.g., entries in a project manual). The contractor defines the data format.  

Vehicle Documentation Systems or components that must fulfill safety regulations by authorities or legal requirements must be marked on the drawings. Reasons and characteristics to be documented are defined by authorities. These demands are required during the development of the part and latest in the PTO phase.

### Rear Crash System Description:

- The rear crash system uses an aluminum extrusion bent beam to support crash performance.
- It is designed to handle both low-speed and high-speed crash loads and other bumper system load cases.
- Bending operations require 2D axial torsions after extrusion, alongside necessary procedures (reheating, cooling, stress reduction).
- Bending procedures are showcased in illustrative pictures.

---

### Supplier Instructions:

- **Assembly Sequence:** Suppliers must define the sequence and coordinate with VinFast.
- **Welding:** VinFast provides MIG CAD joining standards (VFDST00029700).
- **Cost Responsibility:** Suppliers must submit comprehensive costs for part production, machining, heating/cooling facilities, tooling, and checking fixtures.
- **Dimensional Accuracy:** Refer to 3D CAD data supplied by VinFast (subject to developmental changes).

---

### Quality and Testing Standards:

1. **Corrosion Testing:** Components must pass "VFDST00040300 Cyclic Corrosion Testing," ensuring no dirt or water retention in installed conditions, avoiding car body abrasions.
2. **Salt Spray Test:** Components with metallic coatings must pass without red rust per "VFDST00041200 Salt Spray". Painted parts in visible areas must endure 10-year corrosion resistance and the VDA 621-415 climatic-change test.
3. **Tolerance Compliance:** General tolerances are specified under "VFDST00018200-General tolerances".
4. **Dimensional Precision:** Welding processes adhere to "VFDST00000013-Dimension tolerance."

### Visual References:

- The bending patterns for extrusion beams are depicted in provided examples.
