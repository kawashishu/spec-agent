11 Production Quality.

11.1 In Process Testing.
In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuing improvement. Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan.

When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked. 

The table that follows summarizes the various IP tests and the acceptance parameters for each. They form the basis on which to develop a complete Control Plan for these and their related significant process characteristics. The Control Plan will include frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.

11.3 Dimensional Control.  
The production supplier has ultimate responsibility to write the Control Plan and to identify significant characteristics (SC) above and beyond the significant and critical (SC, CC/) features identified by VinFast. The production supplier must also establish initial Process Control and ongoing process capability reporting in accordance with VinFast’s requirements.  

The Control Plan will identify features requiring process capability. Process capability must be established from 30 randomly selected pieces from a continuous production run of at least 300 pieces. This process capability must meet AIAG PPAP edition 4. Capability data must be included in the PPAP documentation.  

Once process capability has been demonstrated, X-bar and R charts must be employed for ongoing control of characteristics identified within the Control Plan unless explicitly waived by VinFast ATI1.  

Acceptance of parts under any sampling plan or statistical process control procedure does not relieve the supplier of the responsibility to ensure that every part meets all requirements specified in the purchase order and component print.  

Defects identified during the implementation of the in-process sampling plan necessitate the supplier to invoke the reaction plan program as specified in the Control Plan.  

Individual VinFast ATI1 departmental requirements for process capability numbers (Cp, Cpk, etc.) may supersede general guidelines at any time.  

A documented fail-safe system must be established by the supplier, approved by VinFast, and be implemented across all forging, heat treating, machining, and final assembly facilities/operations. This ensures that any non-compliance front knuckles are permanently removed from the product flow.

11.4 X-RAY Inspection for Porosity, Voids, & Cracks (Applicable only for Casting).  

1. **Inspection Framework:**  
X-ray inspection for internal discontinuities must occur post-casting as outlined in the process control plan. During the PV and IP-I stages, the supplier is responsible for developing specific acceptance standards for critical areas prone to internal discontinuities, such as porosity, shrinkage, and inclusions.  

Standards and locations must be approved by VinFast ATI1 and aligned with ASTM E155 & E505 references and standards. These standards must be incorporated into production control plans.  

2. **Operator Training:**  
Operators must undergo training to interpret potential flaws using the chosen equipment for production x-ray inspection. Training must comply with EN 473 or ISO 9712 standards, which outline general principles for qualification and certification of non-destructive testing (NDT) personnel. Evidence of the training must remain on file for VinFast STA / ATI1 inspection.  

3. **Testing Equipment Standards:**  
Test equipment must detect discontinuities equal to or greater than ASTM E155 & E505 Plate 1 standards within defined critical areas. Both film and real-time x-ray methods may be employed if capable of resolving defects per the minimum standard specified above.  

4. **Manual and Automatic Inspection Capabilities:**  
X-ray inspection equipment must allow manual inspection of any or all component areas as deemed necessary. Automatic defect recognition systems may be employed only after proving their defect resolution efficacy during the "run at rate trial" for the specific component.

11.5 Fluorescent Dye Penetrant for Surface Defects (Casting/Forging) (crack check)

1. A fluorescent dye penetrant test for cracks and surface discontinuities will be performed on all exterior part surfaces, per ASTM E165 (method A) and ASTM E433.

2. Operators must receive appropriate training in interpreting potential flaws with the particular equipment chosen for the production dye penetrant inspection procedures in accordance with EN 473 (General principles for qualification and certification of NDT personnel) or ISO 9712 (Non-destructive testing - Qualification and certification of personnel). Evidence of this training shall be held on file for inspection by Vinfast STA / ATI1.

3. Specified defects may be checked for severity by grinding removal if the following conditions are met:
   - a) The removal method must be proven not to mask the defect to the fluorescent dye penetrant detection.
   - b) The depth of removal must not create any stress raisers or thin out any wall thickness below the as-cast print specified minimum. The surface finishes after any material removal must be fine enough such that no notches are created which could initiate fatigue cracks (this is defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1mm and/or root radius less than or equal to 5mm).
   - c) The depth of removal must not violate the part print tolerances.

4. If any defects in excess of the maximum allowable values and/or acceptance standards are found, refer to the reaction plan within the Process Control Plan.

5. All parts inspected during IP-II phase must be shown to be free from defects, for a period of 90 days in order that this requirement is revoked. Otherwise, dye penetrant inspection shall continue until ATI1 / STA is satisfied that this process is no longer necessary.

11.6 Feature Removal Standards & Surface Finish (Castings/Forging)

1. The maximum allowable flash will be no greater than 0.5 mm; a chamfer allowance of 2 mm (max) is acceptable to accommodate this requirement. The use of controlled grinding operations on the part is approved for flash and sharp edge removal in order to ensure safe part handling. In any areas where flash or other defects are removed, the minimum wall thickness detailed on the part model must be maintained. In addition, the surface finish after any material removal must be fine enough so that no notches are present which could initiate fatigue cracks (this is defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1mm and/or a root radius less than or equal to 5mm). In general, the removal of any material from a part must not compromise the part function.

   As-cast surface roughness shall be less than or equal to cast surface Rz < 50, web & fettled areas Rz < 50. Equivalent specification to be followed for forged surfaces.
