**3.2 Technical requirement**

The belt drive rack-mounted electric power steering system shall provide assist force to the rack bar as determined.

The technical information should display the details of parts and components, including VinFast's designated part number, usage per car, procurement code, and applicability to VF36 and VFe36 models.

Technical Requirements:
- Part design
- Part requirements
- Functional and performance requirements at the VinFast level

**Details as per Table 1:**  
The part named *VFe36_R-EPS_Steering Gear* has the part number CHS81004008. It is made of multi-material, with one unit required. The purchase level labeled "P" indicates that this part applies to the VF36 and VFe36 vehicle profiles in the EU and US markets, as well as ASEAN regions for both ECO and PLUS configurations.

*Table 1: Technical information table.*

The supplier is requested to provide support during the feasibility phase by supplying the needed data and information. Suppliers are expected to:
- Develop, design, conduct tests, and produce parts or systems in their own responsibility.
- Produce technical and functional mounting concepts, as well as component/system requirement outputs, through engineering collaboration.

**Objective Targets:**
- Weight and cost-optimized design  
- Quality assurance  
- Maturity of the part/system  
- NVH (Noise, Vibration, and Harshness), Vibration and soundproof capabilities  

The steering gear includes a sealing to isolate the interior from external surroundings. This sealing must ensure watertightness, based on specified test procedures, and should be developed in collaboration with the VinFast engineering team.

<page number="9">
3.2.1 General Description of the Component  
The steering gear must provide the following basic functions:  
- Provide mechanical connection to IMS and knuckle.  
- Translate rotation of steering wheel to axial movement of rack.  
- Translate input torque to rack force.  
- Provide assistance force to reduce steering effort.  
- Provide feedback torque to driver.  
- Provide signal interface to communicate with other ECUs.  

For VFe36 the steering gear will be designed as belt-drive EPS:  
Electric power steering featuring a steering-rack/belt drive system (belt-drive EPS) features higher performance. An axially parallel electric motor leading to the steering rack transmits the steering-power assistance directly to the steering rack by means of a toothed-belt drive and a recirculating-ball mechanism. This system is distinguished by the precise responsiveness of the steering and immediate feedback from the road surface.  
The SAS-steering angle sensor is implemented into the steering gear assembly and measures the steering angle and torque.  

Figure 1: Isometric view  
This figure illustrates an isometric view of the belt-drive electric power steering system. It highlights the gear assembly, the toothed-belt drive, the motor, and various connection elements. The design emphasizes precision, responsiveness, and integration with the steering angle sensor.

The EPS provides actuator support for advanced ADAS functions:  

**Actuator-Driven ADAS Functions by EPS:**  

1. **Lane Keep Assist (LKA):**  
   Automatically adjusts steering to restore proper travel within the lane when deviations are detected.

2. **Lane Departure Warning:**  
   Alerts the driver through steering wheel vibrations when unintentional lane drifting is detected.

3. **Lane Centering Control (LCC):**  
   Maintains vehicle positioning in the center of the ego lane and adjusts speed according to traffic conditions.

4. **Emergency Lane Keeping:**  
   Makes palpable steering corrections to prevent the vehicle from departing the road in critical situations.

5. **Automatic Lane Change Assist (ALCA):**  
   Partially automated feature adjusting steering to enable safe lane changes based on driver input.

6. **Highway Pilot:**  
   Automates driving functions including speed control, lane keeping, entering/exiting lanes, and traffic speed adaptation.

7. **Fully Automated Park Assist:**  
   Detects parking spaces and automatically steers vehicles into parallel or perpendicular parking spots.

8. **Remote Parking:**  
   Enables entry and exit from parking spaces with or without driver presence in the vehicle.

9. **Summon Mode:**  
   Allows the vehicle to autonomously move to a location either by navigating out of parking spots or following directives.

<page number="25">
The EPS acts as an actuator for the following ADAS functions:

Sr. No. | Features | Short Description   
---|---|---   
1 | Lane Keep Assist | The LKA system detects when the vehicle deviates from a lane and automatically adjusts the steering to restore proper travel inside the lane without additional input from the driver.  
2 | Lane Departure Warning | The lane departure warning function shall notify the driver through steering wheel vibrations when the driver unintentionally drifts towards the line or the edge of the lane.  
3 | Lane Centering Control | LCC is available on highways and highway-like roads (roadways separated by constructional means) in the speed range from 60 km/h to 130 km/h. LCC keeps the ego vehicle in the center of the ego lane while either maintaining the driver set speed, a current speed limitation, or a predefined distance to a preceding vehicle giving priority to whatever requires the lower speed.  
4 | Emergency Lane Keeping | Emergency lane keeping makes a palpable steering correction in the opposite direction to keep the vehicle on track and thereby avoid the severe consequences of the vehicle departing the road.  
5 | Automatic Lane Change Assist | Auto Lane Changing Assist (ALCA) is a driver assistance system that supports drivers during a lane change to guarantee a safe lane change maneuver. As a partially automated driving system, this feature adjusts the steering wheel to move the vehicle to the adjacent lane after a manual request from the driver.  
6 | Highway Pilot | Highway Pilot automates such driving functions as speed control, lane keeping, and lane exiting and entering. When the driver turns the system on, it’s able to match the vehicle’s speed to traffic flow.  
7 | Fully Automated Park Assist | Automatic park assist helps the driver parallel and perpendicular park their vehicle nearly automatically. The system finds a space and automatically steers the vehicle into the parking space.  
8 | Remote Parking | The system enables automated parking for pulling into and out of selected parking spaces. The driver has the option to remain in the car or get out ahead of time while the vehicle parks itself.  
9 | Summon Mode | Summon Mode (SM) is a driver assistance system that lets the vehicle automatically move to a location from a parking spot. The user has two different options: 1. The vehicle will automatically leave its parking spot and navigate around objects to reach the user when the user requests this from a distance within a radius of 65m by a remote button on a mobile app. 2. The user can also send the vehicle to a location (within 65m from the vehicle) by selecting this location on a map on the mobile app ("Go to target").

### 3.9.8.2 Detailed Function Description

#### 3.9.8.2.2 Active Return
The tyre and suspension system provide a self-aligning steering axis moment to ensure the system returns to the center.
