</page>

<page number="23">
Recycling:

**Recycled Materials.** When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’). Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclers and postproduction recycles, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred with respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert’s team at VINFAST.

**Recycling Scheme.** This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental expert’s team at VINFAST before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

Material Requirements & Corrosion:

**Please refer to the VINFAST Request for Quotation.**

**Additional Requirements.** 

**Corrosion Requirements Interior:**
- Screws, bolts on Handles, mirror
- Key
- Seat belts
- Trunk area
- Seat structure
- Invisible structural parts
- Vehicle tooling
</page>

<page number="24">
Generally: 
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosive position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. Corrosively Low: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. Corrosively Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. High corrosively: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. Very high corrosively: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass System/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

Component test for Metallic surfaces:
- Fog test: ISO6270 CH  
- Salt spray test: ISO9227  

For Organic coatings:
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B.

Alternative tests are possible, if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

Test criteria:
| Area                     | Corrosivity          | Metallic coatings             | Organic coatings         | Pass criteria        |
|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                  | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227       | 96 h → ISO6270 CH        | No red rust          |
| Exterior                 | Medium               | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227          | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust     |
| High & not visible for customer / High & visible | High                  | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227  | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust |
</page>

<page number="25">
Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT. Rust creep according to ISO4628-8 is defined as follows: galvanized steel must meet a criterion of d ≤ 4 mm, and steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet must meet d ≤ 1-2 mm.

Blistering criteria state that blister size must not exceed max. S2, as per DIN EN ISO 4628-2. Edge corrosion is limited to ≤ 10%. Weld seam corrosion must not exceed ≤ 5%. The degree of rusting must remain ≤ Ri 1, as specified in ISO4628-3.

The interior is generally considered a dry area, which means a low corrosively classification. Exceptions include floor areas or spots subject to wetness/abrasion due to shoes or drinking juices, which could produce corrosion. To prevent galvanic corrosion, coating parts that combine different metals is recommended.

Edges should be burr-free, especially painted ones, to ensure good edge coverage and avoid wear. For seat structures without coating (blank steel), it is vital to ensure new parts remain corrosion-free; visible corrosion risks must be avoided for customers. For invisible areas, test criteria may be lower, but visible areas must never exhibit corrosion, and full functionality over lifetime must be guaranteed.

Vehicle tooling stored in the trunk is usually classified under low corrosively exposure, but wear-prone tool surfaces may experience medium corrosively exposure.

Corrosion requirements for electric components are pertinent as indicated under alternative specifications.

### Test plan
The test plan establishes responsibility and scheduling for testing and outlines necessary testing devices. It provides a clear visual representation of test results and progress. Continuous monitoring of test results is mandatory.

VINFAST reserves the right to verify test results independently. Accordingly, the SDS is required to deliver needed test parts at no cost. Test procedures and documentation must be approved by VINFAST's validation engineer and component lead engineer.

Weekly updates to the test plan are mandatory during the testing phase. The SDS must ensure safety and proper scheduling for negative results to allow re-testing within committed timelines. VINFAST must receive all test protocols or reports for verification and may attend testing sessions. Modifications to approved testing procedures require VINFAST/SDS agreement.

If incorrect parts, missing components, or unauthorized testing procedures are identified, responsibility falls to SDS to redo testing at their own expense. Negative test results entail SDS-planned retesting, with costs borne by SDS if liable for the failure.
</page>

<page number="26">
Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible to use the DVP&R template provided by VINFAST testing department. The content of the DVP&R is the responsibility of the SDS. The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart) and serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST. The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VINFAST departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department (VINFAST), SQA (VINFAST) and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.

### Testing

#### General
The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 0). It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.

To prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible. Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS have to be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered by the SDS from VINFAST.

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for only its component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VINFAST requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VINFAST.

<page number="27">
All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved.

All tests must be documented according to VINFAST standard, or alternatively to SDS standard if accepted by VINFAST.

The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification. The tests have to be included in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.

Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time or no later than the agreed date, as coordinated with the test department.

VINFAST Logistics determines the number of sample parts, while VINFAST Purchase orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

### Release by Test-Departments
The responsible VINFAST test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the SDS and during the complete vehicle integration tests. 

The SDS must submit positive test reports for all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any issues (e.g., negative test results, wrong parameters/processes), the SDS must submit a test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions (to maintain all milestones and fulfill all targets).

An OK or NOK result needs to be clearly stated on the first sheet of the report.

---

### Analyses and Test-Reports
The SDS has to provide measurement reports that align with VINFAST specifications (VFDST00008900). Reports must be in electronic format with agreed alignments and incorporate measurement concepts for all parts.

After performing the individual tests, samples have to be analyzed in detail. Measurement and test results must be documented with individual values and included in a test report. This report must be submitted to the responsible VINFAST department for release.

Upon request:
- Results with accompanying documentation of initial sample inspections and parallel inspections carried out during development must be submitted to the specialist department.
- Tests conducted alongside series production must be planned and documented regularly or based on specific needs.

**Virtual Testing:**  
Suitable calculation methods are to be used, and adequately detailed calculation models created by the SDS for the purpose of securing, verifying, and effectively optimizing the component properties defined in the technical specification, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations. Requirements related to mechanical properties, such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, are to be secured by means of FEM calculations.  

The tool-dimensioning for injection molding is to be optimized by corresponding simulations. On request, operative calculation models representing the respective development status are to be made available to the requesting technical departments of VINFAST for internal calculations and integration work.  

On request from VINFAST, the SDS must provide suitable FEM models without extra cost.  

**Component Testing:**  
Tests from the SDS according to the evaluation plan must be calculatively documented (e.g., FEM) before tool dimensioning. The following tests are basic required tests. Further required testing will be defined in the DVP, which must be agreed upon and binding between VINFAST and the SDS.  
- Climatic change test according to VFDST00046100 [35].  
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800) [37].

### Geometrical Integration  
**RPS (reference position system):** The classification of the testing range occurs within a functional area. The determination concept aims for a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of assembly and component parts. The RPS concept for design must align with quality assurance requirements in the SE-process. Part placement among adjoining parts must follow the RPS system per VFDST00000011 [34] as per interior and BIW department guidelines.  

**Tolerance analyses:**  
The following tolerance analyses are required for single components and complete systems, including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.  
- Thermic change tests under all climate conditions.  
- Consideration of thermal expansion.
