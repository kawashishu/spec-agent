#### Function Requirements
The most important function of the Cross Car Beam (CCB) is as follows:
- In the event of a crash, including all legal and accepted crash configurations during series usage, the supporting structure must not detach itself from its attachment points to the vehicle body.
</page>

<page number="7">
- The supporting structure must support the A-pillars against each other during a side crash.
- The support force shall be demonstrated in a force-distance diagram.
- The minimum support force must be reached at a distance s < 100 mm (Note: No meaningful values for the support force are yet available. Therefore, the value that arises at the current constructional state of the supporting structure [steel version] applies. This value is the reference value and will be adapted to the specific vehicle in future designs).
- Even under extreme loads in the x-, y- or z-direction, the support structure must not bend or break out into the passenger compartment.
- There must be no cracks in the supporting structure that could endanger the occupants and no sharp corners and edges protrude into the interior.
- The supporting structure should form a restraining function for the parts to be connected (e.g. heating) so that these parts cannot move into the interior in the event of a crash.
- The support structure must maintain the position of the steering column, the front passenger airbag, and the knee protection (driver and front passenger) even in a crash, so that the effectiveness of the airbags and knee protection systems is not impaired.

### Overall Function
**Development targets:**
- Prevention of functional and qualitative problems out of known systems.
- Use of standard and common parts if possible or reasonable.
- Process reliability at production, packaging, transport, and assembly.
- Minimize effort of overall production sequence: production, packaging, transport, and assembly at the assembly line.
- Prevention of displacement.
- Integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of the part package (Simultaneous Engineering) from the concept phase onward. Early inclusion of the developers of neighboring components.
- General reduction in cost compared to predecessor models.
- Functionality has to be ensured within temperature range -30°C (-5°C for Vietnam market) till +85°C.
- Support function of IP.

### Dynamic Stiffness
- For the load-bearing structure steering column system, the two dominant steering column natural frequencies (transverse and vertical) in the vehicle must be kept within the frequency window of >38 Hz for all steering wheel positions and steering wheel variants.
- The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that production influences do not cause the required minimum values to fall short.
- The natural frequency of the steering column with steering wheel in the rigid pedestal is +8 Hz to the required minimum values of the overall system at least in the transverse and vertical directions.
- A technical test of the resonance frequency is carried out by VINFAST.

### Assembling
- The assembly of the support tube into the vehicle must be coordinated with the technology assembly, the production planning in the relevant plant, and the design.
- The standardization of the screw joints on the supporting structure (tightening torques, screwing classes) is to be aimed for.
</page>

<page number="8">
Due to the small installation clearance to the neighboring components, the use of a narrow space screwdriver is to be expected, which means that a maximum screwing class IV can be maintained. The component design must cover the body tolerances, and all requirements stemming from a cockpit module assembly must be fulfilled by the supporting structure.

### Product Characteristics
- The components of the CCB parts must be designed considering all tolerances of parts and assemblies, including heat extension.
- The function of the component must be proven within all existing tolerances, including heat extension.
- Tolerance analyses must be submitted to the departments or persons responsible for the development.
- Assembly ability with adjoining components.
- Functional safety under all loads stated in drawings, test specifications, quality specifications, and legal texts.
- Avoidance of noise caused by the function of components or joints due to unfavorable tolerances.
- Proof must be given that the respective legal requirements regarding safety-relevant matters are met.
- Climatic requirements will depend on VINFAST standards.
- Fastening will utilize screws.

### Materials
The VINFAST environmental compatibility requirements must be met. Material recyclability (recycling concept), particularly processing and high-quality reuse of materials from end-of-life vehicles in new ones, must be ensured. The proportion of production waste for disposal must not exceed 10% of the material used. Secondary raw materials should be used wherever possible.

#### Specific Requirements
- Reduction of material variety.
- Coordination with components of similar function.
- Minimizing the use and consumption of energy and raw materials.
- Reducing logistics and transport efforts throughout the vehicle/component life cycle.
- Providing data on:
  - Total energy expenditure (MJ/component).
  - Transport route for raw materials (km/component).
  - Emissions (gaseous, liquid, solid) during the manufacturing phase (g/component).

These data will aid in ecological-economic product optimization. The Eco-balance of components serves as a decision criterion during design and concept selection. Additionally, attention must focus on reducing material diversity and prioritizing varieties compatible with recycling, including recycling-suitable secondary raw materials.

To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) must be provided via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:
- **Sequential Deployment:** Sequential deployment of all components must be enabled to avoid noise and pressure peaks. A check of deployment for every component is required.
- **Residue-Free Deployment:** Post-deployment, there must be no solid combustion residues classified under current waste legislation as toxic waste or hazardous substances. If this cannot be ensured, components must be dismantled separately and disposed as hazardous substances.
</page>

<page number="15">
A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle or via feedback at the deployment tool.

Marking of positions of pyrotechnical components, especially hidden components such as battery safety terminal clamps and active safety headrests, is required.

In case of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is necessary. Pre-dismantling should be avoided if technically possible, ensuring accessibility of fasteners.

### Recycling:

**Recycled Materials:**

When selecting materials, focus on reducing material variety and ensuring compatibility with available recycling procedures (proven recycling technologies). Secondary raw materials including post-consumer recyclers and post-production recyclers (e.g. polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) must be prioritized based on market availability. These recycled materials must be marked according to defined parts marking standards and reported to the environmental compliance team at VINFAST.

**Recycling Scheme:**

The project-wide requirements for recycling and repair schemes in component development include:
- Designing parts and components for cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.
- Providing a recycling scheme that includes a layout of the possible recycling process, preferred recycling partners, and cost estimation.
- Submission of the recycling scheme to VINFAST’s environmental experts’ team before the milestone PTO (Production Try-Out).

### Material Requirements & Corrosion:

Refer to the VINFAST Request for Quotation.

**Corrosion, Surface Requirements:**

For production series, the support tube is unpainted, lightly oiled, and free of oil accumulations. The oil used must not cause nuisance odors in the passenger compartment or harm the health of the driver and front passenger. Lubricants required for production that may adhere to the support tube must be agreed upon with VINFAST. Measures for addressing material combinations on the support structure, particularly steel/AL/Mg, must be provided.
</page>

<page number="16">
For corrosion reasons, the parts must be loaded in covered areas protected from weather conditions such as rain and snow. Parts must be transported in closed transport vehicles, e.g., trucks with tarpaulin.

### Generally:
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosively position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosively Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosively Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
3. **High Corrosively:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very High Corrosively:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

### Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass both system/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests.

#### Component test for Metallic surfaces:
- **Fog test:** ISO6270 CH 
  - Acceptance criteria: See below.

- **Salt spray test:** ISO9227 
  - Acceptance criteria: See below.

#### For Organic coatings:
- **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B
  - Acceptance criteria: See below.

Alternative tests may be proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test criteria:
| Area                               | Corrosively              | Metallic coatings                 | Organic coatings          | Pass criteria       |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area  | Low                      | 240 h NSS → ISO9227              | 96 h → ISO6270 CH          | No red rust          |
| Exterior                           | Medium                   | 480 h NSS → ISO9227              | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B  | NSS: No red rust |
| High and not visible for customer; | High & visible           | 480/720 h NSS → ISO9227          | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust / CCT: See below |

### Pass criteria:
- **NSS (Salt Spray Test):** No red rust observed.
- **CCT (Cyclic Corrosion Test):** Specific approval to be detailed in the testing agreement.
</page>

<page number="17">
Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:  
- **Rust creep according ISO4628-8:**  
  - Galvanized steel: `d ≤ 4 mm`  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: `d≤1 - 2 mm.`  
- **Blistering:**  
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  
- **Edge corrosion:**  
  - `≤ 10%`  
- **Weld seam corrosion:**  
  - `≤ 5%`  
- **Degree of rusting:**  
  - `≤ Ri 1 (according ISO4628-3)`  

### Considerations for Interior Components  
The interior is generally considered a dry area, representing low corrosively. Exceptions may include floor areas or other sections exposed to wetness, abrasion from shoes, or drinking juices. Should different metals be combined, measures must be taken to avoid galvanic corrosion by coating the parts adequately. Additionally, edges, particularly painted edges, must be burr-free to ensure proper edge coverage and prevent wear.

### Seat Structure  
Uncoated (blank steel) seat structures should be corrosion-free, ensuring no visible corrosion risk areas are exposed to the customer. Particular attention should be paid to extreme seat-rest positions. Invisible areas may adhere to lesser criteria, however, it must be ensured that corrosive products do not appear in visible areas, and full functionality over the product's lifetime is maintained.

### Vehicle Tooling  
Typically stored within the trunk, vehicle tooling is subject to low corrosively exposure. For tool surfaces with wear, an assessment of medium corrosively might apply.

---

### Test Plan  
The test plan must outline the responsible entity and timing for testing, listing all required testing devices. It should also display test results in a clear visual format, highlighting the progress of testing. Continuous control of test results must be ensured.

- VINFAST may verify test results independently, requiring SDS to deliver necessary parts free of charge.  
- Test procedures and documentation must gain approval from VINFAST's validation engineer and component lead engineer.  
- Updates to the test plan should be performed weekly during testing phases or as development changes arise.  

#### Responsibility for Testing  
The SDS is responsible for ensuring complete validation of components. Tests must be scheduled in a timeline that allows for approval or re-testing where results require improvements. VINFAST must receive all relevant protocols/reports for verification and may attend testing sessions conducted by SDS or affiliated centers. 

#### Procedures for Deviations  
Any deviations from approved testing must be agreed upon by VINFAST and SDS. Should testing occur with incorrect or missing parts, or if procedures deviate, testing must be redone at SDS's expense. Retesting costs will also fall upon SDS where failures result due to their responsibility.
