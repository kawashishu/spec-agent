3 Additional Technical or Functional descriptions.

A Counter Weight Assembly on a compressor hose is designed to provide balance and stability and improve the NVH of the vehicle. In BEV vehicles, the primary function of the Counter Weight Assembly is to reduce the vibration of the vehicle in all road conditions by isolating the working frequency from the resonance frequency.  

The counterweight will be assembled to the suction and discharge side AC hoses of the compressor. By adding the masses, the vibration transferring from the compressor to the cabin will be reduced.
