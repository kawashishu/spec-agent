# General Project Guidelines

## Development Scope Abstract
This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the Multimedia Display Unit Rear. The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics. 

The contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements. Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production or validation details have to be reported immediately. 

The contractor is a ‘Full Service Supplier,’ with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

## Initial Situation and Objective
The MDU Rear is a new development component. It is not an ECU; it is a display in the 2nd seat row of the VFe36 PLUS variants. It is connected with the MHU by LVDS via FPD-Link III (by HSD connector). Power supply is supported by MHU. The MDU Rear has no SW; the functionality is controlled by the MHU SW. The MDU Rear displays information for the rear passengers like climate and seats with the possibility of changing these settings. The requirements detailing what shall be shown on the MDU Rear are covered in the MHU specbook.

The system is planned for use in various vehicle models, for various country-specific packages, and various combinations of optional equipment. Adaptation of system functions to a given vehicle shall be accomplished by modular component population of the necessary modules and coding via the diagnostics interface.

The design of the MDU Rear shall avoid noise generation such as squeak and rattle, as well as noise caused by moving parts. Furthermore, the electronics shall be designed to work without a fan or external cooling under the required temperature conditions.
