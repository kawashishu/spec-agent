**5. Description and scope of work**

**5.1 Technical requirement**

**5.1.1 Purpose/Component Requirement**  
The purpose of an Encapsulation is to reduce the EDS emitted noise level (see NVH requirements). The EDS Encapsulation must cover the E-Motor, Gearbox, and part of the surrounding components according to the provided design data and package requirements from VF. Design and acoustic functionalities must be ensured by the supplier. The encapsulation must effect a subjective and noticeable interior-noise reduction.  

**5.1.2 NVH Requirement**  
The Encapsulation must ensure the maximum possible sound damping.  
- **Overall Target:** EDS Without encapsulation: 81dB (A); With encapsulation: 76dB (A).  
- **Order Target:** EDS Without encapsulation: 70dB (A); With encapsulation: 65dB (A).  

**Realisation criteria:**  
- Increased wall thickness.  
- Damping material on the inside.  
- Avoid free resonating surfaces.  
- Plastic ribbing.  
- Avoid acoustical bridges.  

Acoustical analyses and calculations must be done by the supplier. Improvements must be implemented by the supplier. **Content:** Airborne noise must be checked on a sound test bench at various measurement points during trailing throttle, turndown, and full-load EDS operation over all revolution speeds.  

The component must not emit any noticeable squeaking or rattling noises in any driving condition.
