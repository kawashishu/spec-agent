This version is legally binding. This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard. Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g., what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English. All official project documentation has to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.

5.20.1.1 Weight Targets.  
200g.  
Because the vehicle weight is a big influence on the energy consumption of the vehicle, the major goal of the weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight. Throughout the whole development, attention must be paid to a weight-optimized design of all components. All weight reduction potentials have to be shown by the supplier, also with their impact on cost, timing, and quality.

5.20.1.2 Fuel Consumption & Driving Performance.  
N/A.

5.20.2 Load  

**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by MSF. The definition of the customer usage is based on the Vinfast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.

**Special events:**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur, and the intended service life will not be reduced.

**Misuse events:**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or neighboring components (principle: "deformation before break").

5.20.3 Vibration Behavior  

**NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior:**  
The maximum vibration level is to be defined by the supplier (brackets must be developed to avoid resonances below a certain frequency).  
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 30Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with MSF.

5.20.4 NVH / Acoustic Performance.  
S&R, General.  
Noises which are perceived by the customers as disturbing have to be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps and forming. The supplier has to guarantee that their components are free of disturbing noise in their vehicle environment and their geometrical integration. Similarly, at vehicle- and audio system excitation under all environmental conditions and over the fixed component service life, there must not be squeak and rattle noise due to excitation of the body (wind load, torsional flexing, etc.) if relative movements occur on the surface. This has to be guaranteed over the whole operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity). To evidence the disturbing noise freedom, the requirements must be coordinated with the responsible testing team.  
  
The supplier is responsible to support the development of vibration and acoustic behavior of the subsystem within the complete vehicle environment and has to ensure constant acoustic quality of delivered parts. This includes active support for pointing out problems, making proposals to solve issues, and delivering necessary parts for comparison, tuning and evaluation free of charge as requested.  

5.21 Durability / Life Time.  
The lifetime mileage of the complete vehicle shall be at least 160,000 km, and the vehicle lifetime shall be at least 10 years.  

The environmental operating conditions are:  
- -40°C to +85°C ambient (Component Level).  
- 0 - 100% relative humidity.  
- -100 m to 3500 m above mean sea level.

<page number="46">
5.22 Electrical Requirements.  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations.  

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.  

Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners, etc., that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials.  

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  

Terminals, connectors: Electrical terminals should not be placed at lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is first of all a requirement for tightness. Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  

Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.  

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of >1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture entry.
