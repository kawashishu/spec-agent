Status: New.  

Summon Mode realizes the automated drive of the vehicle from the current position to a predefined destination. The destination can be defined as the current location of the user as well as a user-defined location. The user can activate the SM function via wireless equipment, such as a mobile phone with C-APP and Bluetooth, which requires the vehicle to be capable of wireless connectivity (e.g., LTE or Bluetooth).  

As a core part of automated driving, Summon Mode calculates the optimal trajectory based on the current vehicle position and destination while simultaneously controlling acceleration, braking, and steering. Users are responsible for overwatching the vehicle throughout the process and stopping it actively when necessary. This function adheres to local regulations, specifically governing the maximum distance between the user and the vehicle (6m for EU and 65m for U.S). Summon Mode also includes the FAPA/Park Out function.

2.2 Sequence Diagram.
The sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between different system components during the operational states. These components include User/C-app, T-box/BCM, ADCU, and Vehicle. There are separate sequences for operations with and without a global path.

Without Global Path:
- The user presses the start button repeatedly.
- The system performs self-check. If passed, localization begins within the ADCU.
- User Interaction: The destination of the vehicle is sent to the C-App, with location mapping and localization starting in the vehicle.
- If a replan is required, mapping happens, otherwise, automated driving commences.
- The vehicle arrives at its destination, followed by secure vehicle ignition off and stop.

With Global Path:
- User presses the start button repeatedly.
- The system performs self-check. If passed, localization begins within the ADCU.
- User Interaction: Destination secured with a global path calculated by the C-App.
- Localization progresses, mapping identifies if replan is needed.
- The vehicle enters automated driving, approaching and securing its destination.
- Stops follow once the final destination is achieved. Secure vehicle ignition off occurs before the automated shutdown.

Suspended State:
- The system pauses due to triggered conditions or timeout.
- Corresponding information transferred to user/C-App.
- Resume button activation reinitiates the active state functionality.

Abort State:
- The abort sequence triggered due to failure conditions or timeouts.
- System reports fault and secure ignition off occurs in conjunction with user notifications.

Figure 3 effectively summarizes standard operations, fault responses, and conditional interactions between subsystems during autonomous vehicle performance.

15.3.3 / / 2.3 Function Interaction.

Requirement ID: FS-334522.
Type: --.
Status: New.

Summon is activated by the User on C-APP, with the precondition that C-APP should confirm the vehicle status and make sure that the location of the vehicle is available. All local regulations should be satisfied as well. The interaction is as followed:

1. **Step 1:**  
   The Authentication between T-box and ADCU via Ethernet should be done beforehand. Detail is provided in Chapter 3.2.4.  
   The Authentication between T-box and ADCU via CAN will follow the mechanism of RP.  

2. **Step 2:**  
   When the user activates the SM function, MHU sends out ‘MHU_SMControlReq=1request’ to ADCU to ask for the activation of SM.  

3. **Step 3:**  
   When ADCU receives ‘MHU_SMControlReq=1request’ and the self-check passes, the system will reply with ‘SM_Status=1 Standby’, waiting for further input.  

4. **Step 4:**  
   SM has two features:  

   - **Global path is provided by C-APP navigation.**  
     The interaction is as followed:  
     After the user defines the destination location or selects the ‘come to me’ function, T-box sends out ‘MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 1 available’, indicating that Navigation can provide the global path. C-APP will send out the calculated global path by points and ADCU if the distance is within 65m (for US) range or 6m (for EU).  

     Example:  
     `MHU_SM_GP_Point_1_latitudeMHU_SM_GP_Point_1_LongitudeMHU_SM_GP_Point_2_latitudeMHU_SM_GP_Point_2_Longitude……(TBD)`  

   - **No global path available.**  
     If the C-APP navigation cannot calculate a global path after receiving the destination position, T-box will be informed and send out ‘MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 0 not available’, together with the destination position. In this scenario, SM will calculate the Path based on SLAM.

15.3.3 / / 2.3 Function Interaction

Requirement ID: FS-334522  
Type: --  
Status: New  

Summon is activated by the User on C-APP, with the precondition that C-APP should confirm the vehicle status and make sure that the location of the vehicle is available. All local regulations should be satisfied as well. The interaction is as follows:

1. **Step 1**  
   The Authentication between T-box and ADCU via Ethernet should be done beforehand. Detail in Chapter 3.2.4.  
   The Authentication between T-box and ADCU via CAN will follow the mechanism of RP.  

2. **Step 2**  
   When the user activates the SM function, MHU sends out 'MHU_SMControlReq=1request' to ADCU to ask for the activation of SM.  

3. **Step 3**  
   When ADCU receives 'MHU_SMControlReq=1request', and self-check passes, ADCU replies with 'SM_Status=1 Standby', waiting for further input.  

4. **Step 4**  
   SM has two features:  
   - **Global path provided by C-APP navigation.**  
     After the user defines the destination location or selects the ‘come to me’ function, T-box sends out 'MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 1 available', indicating the navigation can provide the global path. C-APP will then send out the calculated global path by points to ADCU if the distance is within a 65m range (for US) or 6m range (for EU).  
     Points such as MHU_SM_GP_Point_1_latitude, MHU_SM_GP_Point_1_Longitude, etc., are included.  

   - **No Global path available.**  
     If C-APP navigation cannot calculate a global path after receiving the destination position, T-box sends out 'MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 0 not available' along with the destination position. Here, SM calculates the path based on SLAM.  

5. **Step 5**  
   When SM receives the MHU signal 'MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 1 available', together with path points, or 'MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 0 not available', SM starts checking E2 condition:
   - If passed, SM replies 'SM_Status=2: Enable'.  
   - If failed, SM sends out 'SM_ReqInfoDispTxt2 = xxx'.  
   Only upon receiving 'SM_Status=2: Enable', C-APP allows the user to press the start button. Until then, it remains invalid.  

6. **Step 6**  
   When the user keeps pressing the start button, C-APP sets up communication with T-box. T-box then sends 'MHU_SMstartReq = 1: request'. After receiving 'MHU_SMstartReq = 1: request', ADCU executes the handshake process with all associated parts (as in FAPA), after which SM begins vehicle control.  

7. **Step 7**  
   During the maneuvering phase, SM reports the object vehicle's position to C-APP. If the global path is available, ADCU uploads the SLAM-based local path for close proximity along with the remaining global path. Otherwise, ADCU uploads the local path for close proximity along with the destination position.  

8. **Step 8**  
   During the cruising phase, if the user stops pressing the start button, T-box sends 'MHU_SMstartReq = 0: not request'. If the heartbeat communication between C-APP and T-box disconnects, T-box sends 'MHU_RemoteconnectionSts = 0Disconnected'. ADCU then transitions to suspend state, waiting for resumption. Other suspend conditions (detailed in Chapter 2.1) initiate the system to stop the vehicle, maintain ESC pressure, and send 'MHU_ReqInfoDispTxt1 = xxx' to inform the user. Meanwhile, C-APP inhibits function start requests until suspend conditions are removed, guided by a timeout parameter.  

9. **Step 9**  
   During the maneuvering phase, ADCU sends 'ADAS_BCM_IndicatorlightReq' to control the turning and hazard lights. Upon arriving at the destination, the hazard light is activated, while turning lights follow path planning triggers.  

10. **Step 10**  
    During the cruising phase with a global path:
    - If system encounters obstacles or unavoidable situations making the path inaccessible, it initially attempts obstacle avoidance via SLAM. If insufficient space exists to bypass obstacles, the system stops the vehicle and sends 'replan_flg=1request replanning' feedback to the user before switching to suspended state.  
    - If a new global path is provided through C-APP, the system resumes, returning to active state.  
    - Where no alternative global path exists, the system aborts.

15.3.3 // 2.3 Function Interaction.

Requirement ID: FS-334522. Type: --. Status: New.

Summon is activated by the User on C-APP, with the precondition that C-APP should confirm the vehicle status and ensure the location of the vehicle is available. All local regulations must be satisfied as well. The interaction follows these steps:

1. **Step 1:**  
   The authentication between T-box and ADCU via Ethernet should be completed beforehand. This process is detailed in Chapter 3.2.4. Additionally, the authentication between T-box and ADCU via CAN will follow the mechanism of RP.

2. **Step 2:**  
   When the user activates the SM function, the MHU sends out `MHU_SMControlReq=1request` to ADCU requesting activation of SM.

3. **Step 3:**  
   When ADCU receives `MHU_SMControlReq=1request`, and the self-check passes, it will reply with `SM_Status=1 Standby`, waiting for further input.

4. **Step 4:**  
   SM has two features:  
   - **Global Path Provided by C-APP Navigation:**  
     After the user defines the destination location or selects the "come-to-me" function, the T-box sends out `MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 1 available`, indicating that navigation can provide the global path. C-APP will send the calculated global path by points and ADCU if the distance is within the regulation range of 65m (US) or 6m (EU).  
     Example coordinates:  
     `MHU_SM_GP_Point_1_latitude, MHU_SM_GP_Point_1_Longitude, MHU_SM_GP_Point_2_latitude, MHU_SM_GP_Point_2_Longitude...`  

     - **No Global Path Available:**  
       If C-APP navigation cannot calculate a global path after receiving the destination position, the T-box will send `MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 0 not available` along with the destination position. SM will calculate the path using SLAM in this case.

5. **Step 5:**  
   Upon receiving the MHU signal `MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 1 available` or `MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 0 not available`, SM checks E2 conditions. If passed, it replies `SM_Status=2: Enable`; if not, it sends `SM_ReqInfoDispTxt2 = xxx`. Only when C-APP receives `SM_Status=2: Enable`, the user will be allowed to press the start button to initiate the SM function.

6. **Step 6:**  
   When the user keeps pressing the start button, C-APP sets up communication with T-box, which sends out `MHU_SMstartReq = 1: request`. Upon receiving this message, ADCU initiates the handshake process with all associated parts (similar to FAPA), enabling SM to control the vehicle.

7. **Step 7:**  
   In the maneuvering phase, SM reports the object vehicle position to C-APP.  
   - If global path is available, ADCU uploads the SLAM-based local path in the close area along with the rest of the global path.  
   - If no global path is available, ADCU uploads the local path in the close area along with the destination position.

8. **Step 8:**  
   During cruising, if the user stops pressing the start button, T-Box sends `MHU_SMstartReq = 0: not request`. If heartbeat communication between C-APP and T-box is disconnected, T-Box sends `MHU_RemoteconnectionSts =0Disconnected`. ADCU switches to a suspended state and awaits a resume request. Additional suspend conditions are listed in Chapter 2.1. While suspended, the system stops the car, maintains ESC pressure, and sends `MHU_ReqInfoDispTxt1 = xxx` to inform the user.

9. **Step 9:**  
   In the maneuvering phase, ADCU sends `ADAS_BCM_IndicatorlightReq` to control turning and hazard lights. Hazard lights are used upon arrival at the destination, while turning lights are controlled by path planning.

10. **Step 10:**  
    If in cruising mode the preplanned global path becomes inaccessible due to obstacles or unavoidable situations, the system attempts to avoid the obstacle using SLAM. If avoidance fails, SM stops the vehicle and sends `replan_flg=1request replanning` to the user, switching to suspend mode. Upon receiving a new global path from C-APP, SM resumes. If no alternative path is available, the system aborts.

11. **Step 11:**  
    When an abort condition is triggered, SM stops the vehicle and sends `SM_ReqInfoDispTxt1 = xxx` to T-box. After three handshake cycles with T-box and ADCU, the connection terminates.

12. **Step 12:**  
    Once the vehicle reaches its destination, ADCU asks VCU to switch the vehicle to P-Gear and activate EPB. After three handshake cycles, communication disconnects from T-box and ADCU. BCM activates hazard lights.

13. **Step 13:**  
    T-box informs BCM to lock the vehicle and turn off power upon receiving `SM_Status = 0x4Finished`.

14. **Step 14:**  
    C-APP features a "quit" button, allowing the user to stop the function mid-process. Upon receiving `MHU_SM_QuitReq = 1:request exit` from T-box, SM disconnects, switches to P-Gear, activates EPB, and terminates communication with associated parts.

15.3.3 2.3 Function Interaction.  

Requirement ID: FS-334522.  
Type: --.  
Status: New.  

Summon is activated by the user on C-APP, with the precondition that C-APP should confirm the vehicle status and ensure the location of the vehicle is available. All local regulations should also be satisfied. The interaction proceeds as follows:  

1. **Step 1**  
   The authentication between T-box and ADCU via Ethernet must be completed beforehand as detailed in Chapter 3.2.4. The authentication between T-box and ADCU via CAN follows the RP mechanism.  

1. **Step 2**  
   When a user activates the SM function, MHU sends out `MHU_SMControlReq=1request` to ADCU, asking for the activation of SM.  

1. **Step 3**  
   When ADCU receives `MHU_SMControlReq=1request`, and the self-check passes, it replies `SM_Status=1 Standby`, waiting for further input.  

1. **Step 4**  
   SM has two features:  
   - **Global Path Provided by C-APP Navigation:**  
     After the user defines the destination location or selects the 'come to me' function, T-box sends out `MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 1 available`, indicating Navigation can provide the global path. C-APP will send the calculated global path by points to ADCU if the distance is within 65m (US range) or 6m (EU range).  
     Example: `MHU_SM_GP_Point_1_Latitude, MHU_SM_GP_Point_1_Longitude, MHU_SM_GP_Point_2_Latitude, MHU_SM_GP_Point_2_Longitude... (TBD).`  
   - **No Global Path Available:**  
     If C-app navigation is unable to calculate a global path after receiving the destination position, T-box will be informed and send out `MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 0 not available` along with the destination position. In this case, SM calculates the path based on the SLAM.

1. **Step 5**  
   When SM receives the MHU signal `MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 1 available`, together with path points (or `MHU_SM_global_path_Status = 0 not available`), it starts the system check for E2 conditions:  
   - If the check passes, it replies `SM_Status=2: Enable`.  
   - If the check fails, it sends out the message `SM_ReqInfoDispTxt2 = xxx`.  
   Only when C-app receives `SM_Status=2: Enable`, the user can press the start button (before this, the button is 'invalid') to utilize the SM function.

1. **Step 6**  
   When the user keeps pressing the start button, C-app sets up communication with T-box. T-box sends out `MHU_SMstartReq = 1: request`. After receiving this signal, ADCU starts the handshake process with associated parts (similar to FAPA). SM initiates vehicle control.

1. **Step 7**  
   In the maneuvering phase, SM reports the object vehicle position to C-App:  
   - If a global path exists, ADCU uploads the SLAM-based local path for nearby areas and includes the remaining global path.  
   - If no global path exists, ADCU uploads the local path for nearby areas and includes the destination position.  

1. **Step 8**  
   In the cruising phase:  
   - If the user stops pressing the start button, T-box sends `MHU_SMstartReq = 0: not request`.  
   - If heartbeat communication disconnects between C-app and T-box, T-box sends `MHU_RemoteconnectionSts = 0: Disconnected`.  
   The ADCU then switches to suspend state and waits to resume. During suspension, the system halts the car, maintains ESC pressure, and sends `MHU_ReqInfoDispTxt1 = xxx` to inform the user. In this state, C-App inhibits function start requests until suspend conditions are resolved, with waiting time governed by the time-out parameter.

1. **Step 9**  
   In the maneuvering phase, ADCU sends `ADAS_BCM_IndicatorlightReq` to control indicators and hazard lights during destination arrival.

1. **Step 10**  
   In the cruising phase (with global path):  
   - If the pre-planned global path becomes inaccessible due to obstacles or unavoidable scenarios:  
     * The system tries to avoid obstacles using SLAM.
     * If avoidance is infeasible, the system halts and sends `replan_flg=1request replanning` feedback to the user, switching into suspend mode.  
   - When a new global path is provided, the system resumes active mode.  
   - If no alternative path exists, the system aborts.

1. **Step 11**  
   In an abort state, SM controls the vehicle to stop, sends `SM_ReqInfoDispTxt1 = xxx`, and disconnects the handshake between T-box and ADCU after three communication cycles.  

1. **Step 12**  
   Upon destination arrival, ADCU requests VCU to switch to P gear and activate EPB. After three communication cycles, it disconnects the handshake between T-box and ADCU, turning on the hazard light via BCM.  

1. **Step 13**  
   T-Box informs BCM to lock the vehicle and turn off power upon receiving `SM_Status = 0x4Finished`.  

1. **Step 14**  
   C-App includes a 'quit' button for users to terminate the SM function. On receiving `MHU_SM_QuitReq = 1: request exit`, SM disengages the T-box handshake, activates P-Gear, raises EPB, terminates the handshake with all associated parts, and ends functionality.
