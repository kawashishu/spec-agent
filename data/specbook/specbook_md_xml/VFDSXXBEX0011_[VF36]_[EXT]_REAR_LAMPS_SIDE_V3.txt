### 3.10 Material Requirements & Corrosion

Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. **High corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very high corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

### Recycling Scheme

Secondary raw materials, such as post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics), should be preferred considering market availability. Recycled materials need to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and reported to the environmental compliance expert's team at VinFast.

- **Recycling Design:** Development of components requires cost-effective recycling methods at end-of-life.
- **Recycling Process Layout:** The supplier must submit a simple recycling process layout of the component, including preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. This recycling scheme should be delivered to VinFast's environmental expert team before the PTO milestone (Production Try-Out).

### 3.9.8 Drainage and Depollution

Complete drainage of fluids is mandatory for safe and environmentally friendly end-of-life vehicle treatment. Fluid niches and pockets must be avoided. Suppliers are required to provide:
- A **drainage scheme**, including virtual or physical test protocols, with details on the type, weight percentage, and absolute mass of drained fluids in kilograms.
- Submissions should be made to VinFast’s environmental experts team before the PTO Production Try-Out milestone.
</page>

<page number="19">
The vehicle Exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added, such as paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers. Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in lowest positions. Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements. Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement. Edge coverage must ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

### 3.10.1 Corrosion Tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

#### **Component Test for Metallic Surfaces**:
- **Salt Spray Test**: ISO9227, acceptance criteria as detailed below.

3.10 Material Requirements & Corrosion.

Rust creep is defined according to ISO4628-8:
- For galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
- For steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1–2 mm.

Blistering is defined by the maximum blister size:
- Blister size maximum: S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).

Edge corrosion criteria:
- Edge corrosion must be ≤ 10%.

Weld seam corrosion:
- Weld seam corrosion must be ≤ 5%.

Degree of rusting:
- Degree of rusting must be ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

**Stainless Steel:**  
Direct contact with other metals leading to galvanic corrosion must be avoided, and in most cases insulating coatings are required.  
- Test criteria for high visible parts: 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Special attention must be given to crevices.
- Components must undergo testing in their installed position, including any assembled sub-systems.

**Aluminum Parts:**  
Aluminum in highly visible areas must be painted or anodized.  
- Painted aluminum test criteria: Refer to organic coating test criteria.
- Anodized aluminum test criteria: 480 h NSS ISO 9227 without surface change.  
Tests will include assembled sub-systems in situ when possible.

**Chromed Metal Parts:**  
Must pass the following criteria:  
- 240 h NSS ISO9227 without base material corrosion.

**Chromed Plastic Parts:**  
Must be evaluated with the following tests:
- CASS-Test according to DIN EN ISO 9227:
  - Duration: 48 h for exterior parts, 24 h for interior parts.
- Acceptance criteria: No surface defects.
Additionally, parts must complete a 240 h NSS ISO9227 test without surface defects.

**Electric Parts:**  
Electrical units enclosed with air volumes, such as control units located in wet conditions, should be ventilated through moisture/wetness-resistant membranes (e.g., Gortex).  
All material combinations must be selected to prevent galvanic corrosion, covering fasteners and attached brackets to ensure performance.
</page>

<page number="21">
Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners etc. that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion. 

Terminals, connectors: Do not place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is first of all a requirement for tightness. Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.

Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.

### Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues:
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:
- Provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts wherever possible.
- Enlarging the radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone-hitting risk, choose part materials and paint which have the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.
