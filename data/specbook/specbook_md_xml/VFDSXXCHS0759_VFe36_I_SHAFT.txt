6 Supplier responsibilities.

The supplier is responsible for providing and ensuring the completion of work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate risks associated with an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements.**

**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**
The support period for after-sales spare parts must ensure life cycles of the project and requirements detailed in GTC after VinFast's end-of-production for the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**
The supplier of the first-level assembly must provide VinFast after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes BOM tables, parts structure and function descriptions, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters such as installation clearances and part performance parameters.

7 Intellectual Property / Copyright.
