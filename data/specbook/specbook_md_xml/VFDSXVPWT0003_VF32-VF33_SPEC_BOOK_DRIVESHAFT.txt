5.4 Traceability.
For part requirements, follow specifications outlined in VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

5.5 Labeling of Parts.
Suppliers must adhere to VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Clear positioning of labels on parts (with attached pictures of label placement).

6 Testing and Validation and DVP&R.
Testing and validation responsibilities are outlined in file "DVP – VFDSXVPWT0103-CSUV_DVP_DRIVE SHAFT." The test responsibility aligns with RASIC standards at system, sub-system, and component levels in accordance with the Complete Vehicle Specification Book during the concept phase.

Detailed test plan considerations:
- Declaration of standards, norms, and legal requirements.
- Testing methodologies and equipment descriptions (with accompanying pictures).
- Location of testing (internal/external).
- Duration and timeline (structured as a project plan).
- Variants and descriptions of tested parts.
- Total number of components/parts tested.

Ensure mileage target life meets 160,000 km or 10 years, whichever occurs first.

6.1 Function Safety (FUSA).
Suppliers must ensure conformity with:
- IATF 16949:2016, Quality management system standards for automotive production.
- ISO 26262:2018, Functional safety standards for road vehicles.
</page>

<page number="27">
6.2 Operational strength.

6.2.1 General.  
Verification of design regarding operational strength of the complete vehicle and all sub-systems.  
- Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions.
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile.

All contents are fully applicable for the respective subsystem unless stated otherwise.  
Validation activities specifically required for the respective subsystem are defined in this section.  
DVP&R on a component level is to be created by the supplier in accordance with the fulfillment of complete vehicle targets.

6.2.2 Static load cases.  
Static load cases are defined to calculate the cross-sectional forces within the front and rear axle for specific maneuvers. The applied loads, so-called input loads, are forces and torques that occur in the event of the respective maneuver. The input loads, boundary conditions, and maneuvers are subject to adaptation.

6.2.3 Operating load.  
Operating loads are the loads occurring during the intended use of the vehicle.  
The basis for the dimensioning of the operating strength is the maximum load and overall damage target, which is valid for all components and systems not defined as wearing parts.  
The statistical proof must be performed on a component level with the defined dimensioning load spectra. Environmental impacts (temperature, corrosion, wasted water, among other things) must be considered. For safety-relevant components, additional safety factors must be considered (pending on material and loading type). Appropriate definitions must be considered in the system and component technical specification books.  

The relevant test tracks for testing of operational loads include:  
- Rough road durability run.
- Drive train shortened durability run.
- Lateral force durability run.
- On-road durability run.

The vehicle must be dimensioned so that operational loads can be withstood without any damage for the entire target life.  

The drive shafts, as part of the system, must withstand the testing items as defined in the DVP&R under the sections:  
- Complete vehicle durability testing.
- System tests durability.

Critical failures that may lead to a loss of vehicle control must not occur.  
Testing details, evaluation criteria, and loading programs are to be found in the respective testing standard.
</page>

<page number="28">
6.2.4 Load of exceptional maneuvers and misuse loads.

Exceptional Maneuver: Exceptional maneuvers involve occurrences of small quantities (approx. < 100), and they belong to the intended use of the vehicle. Examples include abs-braking and μ-Split/μ-sprung start. The vehicle must be designed to withstand these maneuvers without causing any negative effect on the function.

Misuse Maneuver: Misuse maneuvers are not part of the intended use of the vehicle. Examples include curbstone impact and bump & pothole tests. The vehicle must be dimensioned to ensure:
- Damages after misuse must be clearly recognizable for the driver (customer), e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions or wheel inclined conditions.
- A defined damage chain must be maintained in the event of misuse.

A clearly recognizable plastic deformation of the concerned or neighboring part must occur, along with cracks and damages. Deformation before breakage is the intended aim. The definition of exceptional maneuvers and misuse loads is outlined in the referred document.

The subsystem rear axle must withstand the testing items defined in the DVP&R under the section "Complete Vehicle Exceptional Maneuver and Misuse."

Testing details, evaluation criteria, and the loading program are available in the respective testing standard.

6.3 Function Test.

Functional testing ensures the functionality of the system under specific environmental conditions and loadings. The drive shafts, as part of the subsystem, must undergo testing items defined in the DVP&R under "Complete Vehicle Functional Testing."

Test items listed are not exhaustive, as the complete vehicle undergoes various functional tests during the development process. These tests target different concerns. The rear axle and its parts must perform without failure and fulfill the required functional target values when considering the nature of the test during intended vehicle use.

Testing details, evaluation criteria, and loading program are outlined in the respective testing standard.

Complete Vehicle Testing: All physical testing must comply with the released testing standard.

Tests conducted by VinFast include:
- Rough road durability run.
- Lateral force durability run.
- Drive train shortened durability run.
- Long-distance durability run (mixed circuit).
- Ambient temperature assumption between -40°C to 50°C.

<page number="29">
Exceptional maneuver.  
The design and development process covers the following maneuvers:  
- ABS breaking forward/rearward.
- Vehicle towing.
- Vehicle jacking.
- Bump and pothole test (at lower speed).
- Shift down test.

Scope of exceptional maneuvers and evaluation criteria:  
- Must be agreed upon in the operational strength integration team for the respective vehicle project.
- Vehicle towing.

The results of the exceptional maneuvers have to be evaluated in cooperation with the operational strength integration team concerning the number of occurrences and load heights.

Misuse maneuver.  
The design and development process covers the following misuse maneuvers:  
- Curb stone impact test.  
- Jump start.  
- Bump and pothole test (at higher speed).  
- Extreme braking.  
- Drive shaft misuse test.

Scope of misuse maneuvers and evaluation criteria:  
- Must be agreed upon in the operational strength integration team for the respective vehicle project.

The results of the misuse maneuvers have to be evaluated in cooperation with the operational strength integration team concerning the number of occurrences and load heights.
