11 Production quality.

11.1 In Process testing.
In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuing improvement. Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan. When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked.

The table that follows summarizes the various IP tests and the acceptance parameters for each. They form the basis on which to develop a complete Control Plan for these and their related significant process characteristics. The Control Plan will include frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.

**Table of Tests:**
- Refer DVP for all tests.
- Material Test.
- Environmental Test.
- Component / System Level Testing.

11.2 Visual Inspection.
All parts will be 100% inspected in the formed condition, after heat treatment, and after machining at the time of packing. No surface defects (cracks, notches, malformed areas, etc.) are allowed. These allowable surface defect standards should be made available to the appropriate inspectors and operators at the various manufacturing facilities. The following applies to all surfaces unless otherwise noted.

11.3 Dimensional Control.
The production supplier has ultimate responsibility to write the Control Plan and to identify significant characteristics (SC) over and above the significant and critical (SC, CC/) features identified by VinFast. The production supplier is also responsible for establishing initial Process Control and ongoing process capability reporting per VinFast requirement. The Control Plan will identify those features requiring process capability. Process capability must be established from 30 pieces randomly selected from a continuous production run of at least 300 pieces. The process capability must meet AIAG PPAP edition 4. Capability data is to be included in the PPAP documentation.

When process capability has been demonstrated, X-bar and R charts must be used for ongoing control of characteristics identified in the Control Plan unless specifically waived by VinFast ATI1. Acceptance of parts by any sampling plan or statistical process control procedure does not relieve the supplier of their responsibility that each part meets all requirements of the purchase order and the components print. If any defects are found during implementation of the in-process sampling plan, the supplier must invoke the reaction plan program specified in the Control Plan.

Individual VinFast ATI1 departmental requirements for acceptability of process capability numbers (Cp, Cpk, etc.) may supersede any general guidelines at any time.

A documented fail-safe system must be established by the supplier, approved by VinFast, and be in place at all sheet metal fabrication, heat treating, machining, and final assembly facilities/operations to ensure that any non-compliant subframes are removed permanently from the product flow.

12 Quality characteristics and their testing conditions.

12.1 General requirements.
The tests are carried out at room temperature unless specified otherwise / (23 ±5) °C.

12.1.1 Identification marking.
During the manufacturing process, and after passing quality checks with positive results, each rear axle carrier is provided with standard identification marking. This marking is mechanically applied by means of an engraving unit in the position specified in the drawing. The identification marking must be visible in the installed state and facilitate assignment of the following information:
- Production data: Date of manufacture (see Figure 1).
- Measured values of all features to be verified in accordance with the testing instructions.
- Control data: Inspector, examination results (OK/not OK).
- Reworking data (if applicable): Defect location, type of defect, worker, and examination results.

Figure 1: Example of standard identification marking.

12.2 Semifinished pipes and sheet metal.
Materials are used according to component drawings or technical delivery specifications found in the parts list of the assembly drawing. The requirements listed in the standards referenced in the drawing or the supplier's technical delivery specifications must apply to the semifinished pipes and sheet metal, unless restrictions are stated in the drawing or this standard.

The specifications are to be carefully interpreted based on their intended use as function-critical chassis components. Verification of compliance with these requirements for all component parts must be provided through test reports compliant with DIN EN 10 204.

12.3 Surface.

12.3.1 Surface condition.
Component parts are to be further processed to be free of burrs (≤ 0.3 mm as per DIN ISO 13715) and without chips.

A continuous processing time of the components shall be met via the total processing time in the pre-treatment and painting unit. There shall not be any subdivision of the processing time over the whole production process due to the risk of basic material corrosion. If this requirement is not adhered to, suitable measures shall be taken to prevent basic material corrosion within the storage time. Verifications to this effect shall be documented.

**Surface state of the developing article according to the pre-treatment processes, ie before coating.**
After the pre-treatment processes, no residues (e.g., branded oils/lubricants) may be present on the surface which negatively affect subsequent processes. A check can be made, for example, in accordance with the ASTM standard (water breaking test). Silicate and smoke residues (scaling) and impurities in front and back areas around the welding seams as well as heat-affected zones around them must be removed to such an extent that the formation of an all-over phosphate layer is possible.

**Phosphating.**
Subsequently, a phosphate surface coat with a coating weight of 5 ±3 g/m² shall be applied to internal surfaces, external surfaces, and welding seams. For hollow profiles, an immersion process is mandatory. Thick-layer cathodic dip painting with edge optimization is required. Coating thicknesses must adhere to the following:

| Location        | Minimum | Target Value | Maximum |
|-----------------|---------|--------------|---------|
| Outside         | 35 μm  | 40 μm       | 50 μm  |
| Inside          | 20 μm  | -            | -       |
| Edges           | 8 μm   | -            | -       |

The maximum for external surfaces applies only to the bolting areas marked according to the drawing. Minimum paint coat thickness at the edges shall be verified. Burrs shall meet VDI guideline 2906 sheet 1 and sheet 2. There shall not be defective e-coating locations (e.g., due to missing ventilation holes, output holes, and coating holes). E-coating contact points shall be placed so they are covered later in the assembly.

**E-coating drying at object temperature.**
Minimum: 165 °C and 15-minute baking duration.

If parts are singled out during visual inspection (see subsection 12.5.3) that, with respect to external examination results of the welds (inadequate weld, varying leg size, undercutting, end crater pores), are not carried out with the weld quality in accordance with the assessment groups in the drawing as per DIN EN 25 817 or with the deviations permitted according to the drawing, these can be manually rewelded by trained welders or by automated means while adhering to the following criteria:

**Weld preparation.**  
In the event the first weld is interrupted, the seam ends and beginnings of the defects are to be partially ground. Other weld defects are to be removed. Grinding of the base material is not permitted.

**Rewelding.**  
a) Only one rewelding operation is permitted per weld. In the case of surface pores, a second reworking operation by means of manual welding is possible in exceptional cases.  
b) Rewelding must correspond to all requirements according to the drawing and this standard in terms of the welding technique and also the external and internal examination results of the weld.
