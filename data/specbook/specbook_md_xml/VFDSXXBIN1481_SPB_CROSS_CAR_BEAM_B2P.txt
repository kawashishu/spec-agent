</page>

<page number="7">
Requirements:

During the stiffness and rigidity testing, there must not be any permanent deformations, no breakage, and no customer-relevant modifications.

Most important functions of cockpit:
- Optical trim.
- Absorption of noises.
- Absorbing properties in case of head-impact.
- Integration of add-on parts.
- Has to fulfill all functions over lifetime.

Crosscarbeam IP:
- The cross car beam (CCB) should be used as the main fixation of the IP.
- Master Reference Point between IP main carrier and CCB in Y=0.
- Input about kind of fixation and stiffness defined from SDS IP.
- Technical CCB specifications defined in spec book CCB.

Airbag door:
The airbag door contains an invisible breakup solution. Therefore, the lid-carrier is horizontally divided, if possible symmetrical. If the supplier has the opinion that another airbag door solution fulfills the requirements in a better way, the supplier has the responsibility to inform, present, and discuss the concept with VinFast.

- The split line must be invisible on the dashboard skin (A-surface).
- The hinge lines must not show marks on the skin.
- All break lines of the airbag door are invisible; they can be made by cutting with a cold knife or laser.

Testing conditions:
- The airbag door must be tested at room temperature (+20°C), low temperature (-30°C), and high temperature (+85°C).
- The testing tolerance is ±2.5°C.

VinFast proposes to incorporate an airbag shooting channel on the backside of the IP, using techniques such as vibration welding, ultrasonic welding, or infrared welding. If the supplier has expertise in developing an injection-molded dashboard with an integrated shooting channel, this solution is permissible if no split line is visible on the A-surface of the dashboard and all other requirements mentioned in this technical specification can be fulfilled.

Key development targets:
- There should be no separate door for the passenger airbag.
- The integrated airbag door must be firmly attached to the dashboard to avoid risks of tearing off.
- No risk of injuries to occupants caused by the instrument panel or by the airbag door during and after deployment (collision, secondary collision) must be assured.

Opening force of the airbag door:
- The opening force of the airbag door must be agreed upon with the airbag supplier. It must be specified in the production drawing.
- Maximum opening force should be less than 2.3 kN.
- For the testing program, refer to the safety and restraint system specification, which includes the validation program for all development phases.

Foam separation during airbag deployment:
The foam separation details must align with airbag deployment requirements and meet all safety specifications.

**Pyrotechnic initiator neutralization:**  
*(Text continues but specific additional requirements are left for further definition, as outlined on the next section of relevant documentation.)*
</page>

<page number="22">
To ensure a cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components must include the following requirements:
- Enable sequential deployment of all components to avoid noise and pressure peaks, ensuring deployment per component is verified.
- After pyrotechnical component deployment, no solid combustion residues should remain classified as toxic waste or hazardous substances. Alternatively, these components should be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances.
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components must be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically, directly at the vehicle, or via feedback to the deployment tool).
- Mark positions of pyrotechnical components, especially hidden ones like battery safety terminal clamps or active safety headrests.
- If components are not deployed, their removal is required. Pre-dismantling, if technically possible, should be avoided, ensuring accessibility to fasteners.

### Recycling:
#### Recycled Materials
When selecting materials, focus should be placed on reducing material variety and ensuring compatibility with existing recycling technologies (“proven recycling technologies”). Secondary raw materials such as post-consumer recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, and recycled thermoplastics must be prioritized for market availability. Recycled materials must adhere to the parts marking standards specified in this document and must be reported to VinFast’s environmental compliance experts.

#### Recycling Scheme
Design for recycling parts and components is essential for enabling the cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles. Contractors must provide a recycling scheme detailing the possible recycling process for components, including preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. This recycling scheme must be submitted to VinFast’s environmental compliance experts before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### Material Requirements & Corrosion:
#### Corrosion Requirements (Interior):
Parts subject to corrosion requirements include:
- Screws, bolts on handles and mirrors.
- Key components.
- Seat belts.
</page>

<page number="23">
Trunk area. Seat structure. Invisible structural parts. Vehicle tooling.

Generally:
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. Corrosivity Low: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
2. Corrosivity Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
3. High corrosivity: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. Very high corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

Component test for metallic surfaces:
- Fog test: ISO6270 CH, acceptance criteria see below.
- Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.

For organic coatings:
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

Test criteria:
- Area: Interior, mounted parts, dry area.
  - Corrosivity: Low.
  - Metallic coatings: 240 h NSS → ISO 9227.
  - Organic coatings: 96 h → ISO6270 CH.
  - Pass criteria: No red rust.

- Area: Exterior.
  - Corrosivity: Medium.
  - Metallic coatings: 480 h NSS → ISO 9227.
  - Organic coatings: 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B.
  - Pass criteria: NSS: No red rust.

- Area: High & not visible for customers / High & visible.
  - Corrosivity: High.
  - Metallic coatings: 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227.
  - Organic coatings: 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B.
  - Pass criteria: NSS: No red rust; CCT: See below.
</page>

<page number="24">
Pass criteria for organic coatings after Cycle B corrosion testing:

1. **Rust creep** according to ISO4628-8:
   - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
   - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.

2. **Blistering** (maximum):
   - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).

3. **Edge corrosion**:
   - ≤ 10%.

4. **Weld seam corrosion**:
   - ≤ 5%.

5. **Degree of rusting**:
   - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

**Interior Area Requirements:**
The interior is considered a dry area with **low corrosivity** except for locations such as floor areas or spots exposed to conditions like wetness, shoe abrasion, or spilled liquids that could promote corrosion. Combining different metals must avoid galvanic corrosion by coating those parts appropriately.

**Edges:**
Painted edges must be burr-free to ensure proper edge coverage and to avoid wear.

**Seat Structure:**
Uncoated (blank steel) seat structures must be corrosion-free. Areas prone to corrosion should not be visible to the customer. Extreme seat-rest positions must be taken into account to ensure durability.

**Invisible Areas:**
For invisible areas, lower test criteria may be applied as long as no corrosive products are evident in visible regions and functionality over the vehicle's lifetime is maintained.

**Vehicle Tooling:**
Vehicle tooling stored in the trunk is typically subject to low corrosivity exposure. However, surfaces exposed to wear may require medium corrosivity consideration.

**Test Plan Requirements:**
1. The test plan outlines the responsible party, timing of tests, and required testing devices.
2. It tracks testing progress visually and ensures consistent oversight on test results.
3. If VinFast requires test result verification, SDS must provide necessary parts free of charge.
4. Test procedures and documentation must be approved by a VinFast test engineer.
5. The test plan must be updated weekly or revised due to new development changes.
6. SDS holds responsibility for component testing and must provide all necessary protocols/reports to VinFast. SDS must ensure VinFast attendance at any testing conducted on-site or at designated testing centers.
7. Any deviations from approved procedures must be mutually agreed upon between VinFast and SDS.

**Additional Reference:**
See "Corrosion requirements on Electric Components."
</page>

<page number="25">
If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing must be redone at the cost of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests must be re-planned, and the retesting must be paid for by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for only its component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VFDST-requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VinFast. All relevant Vietnamese law obligations must be achieved.

All tests must be documented according to VF standard, alternatively to SDS standard, if this is accepted by VinFast. The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done during the serial development phase according to the specification. The tests must be included in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.

Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (as coordinated with the test department). Even manual samples can provide sufficient information in certain cases. Measures can thus be introduced in time in the event of assembly problems to ensure the installability of the test parts.

VINFAST Logistics determines the number of sample parts. VinFast Purchase orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports for all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS. CAD data models compliant with VinFast requirements must be provided in time for virtual sample manufacturing.

Marking of sample parts must follow VF Standard VFDST00008700 [41]. Preparation of measurement reports must adhere to VF Standard VFDST00008900 [43]. Reference point systems must comply with VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28].

### Release by Test Departments
The responsible VinFast test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the SDS and during complete vehicle integration tests. 

- The SDS must submit positive test reports for all required tests according to DVP&R.
- In case of any problems (negative test results, incorrect parameters/processes, etc.), the SDS must submit a detailed test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions (to keep all milestones and observe all targets).
- An OK or NOK result must be stated on the first sheet of the test report.

### Analyses and Test Reports
The SDS must provide electronic measurement reports aligned with VF Standard VFDST00008900 [43]. These must include agreed alignments and detailed measurement concepts for all parts during prototype generations. After individual tests, test samples must be analyzed comprehensively.
</page>

<page number="27">
The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report has to be handed over to the responsible VinFast department for release. Upon request, the results together with the documentation of the tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development) are to be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests carried out parallel to series production are to be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.

**Test-report/-information:**
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (part no., change index, materials, production process, additives like grease, and every deviation from approved serial process).
- All parts have to be labeled with description.
- Reason for testing in case of e.g., negative test results and attachment of earlier test reports.
- Testing with exact naming of testing standard, norm, legal requirement, or exact description of agreed testing procedure.

**Documentation of result:**

- For approval with responsible person and company to do the test.

**Progress of testing status:**
Listing of all tests in a table with responsible person, part status, comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the supplier has to give new date for retest with countermeasures to VinFast for approval with responsible person and company to do the test. 

The VinFast test engineer has to be informed in periodic intervals with actual status and progress. If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.

**Archival storage of tested parts:**
Testing parts are only allowed to be scrapped if the VinFast test department agrees to that. On demand of the test engineer, the complete testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.

**BIW-supports, testing devices and -equipment.**
</page>

<page number="28">
### BIW-supports, testing devices, and equipment
