3 Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions.

The table below summarizes the technical details and purchasing levels for the wheel arch liner components:

1. WHEEL ARCH LINER FRT LH: Part number BEX71012001, quantity 1, material PP+EPDM-M15, purchase level H. Applicable to regions VN, EU, and NA for both VFe33 SMART and VFe33 PLUS configurations.
2. WHEEL ARCH LINER FRT RH: Part number BEX71012002, quantity 1, material PP+EPDM-M15, purchase level H. Applicable to regions VN, EU, and NA for both VFe33 SMART and VFe33 PLUS configurations.
3. WHEEL ARCH LINER RR LH: Part number BEX71012003, quantity 1, material PP+EPDM-M15, purchase level H. Applicable to regions VN, EU, and NA for both VFe33 SMART and VFe33 PLUS configurations.
4. WHEEL ARCH LINER RR RH: Part number BEX71012004, quantity 1, material PP+EPDM-M15, purchase level H. Applicable to regions VN, EU, and NA for both VFe33 SMART and VFe33 PLUS configurations.

Wheel arch liners belong to the Exterior functional group for VF7 (VFe34S). They are primarily mounted on the FR fender (at the front) and the body side outer panel (at the rear). Their purpose is to protect the cabin, engine bay, and internal components from dirt, mud, slush, snow, stone chipping, and air flow.

These components are made of non-grained plastics using PP+EPDM-M15 material. They are designed to perform efficiently in all conditions with dimensional stability. Furthermore, they should exhibit no color or gloss changes and no detrimental effects when exposed to extreme temperatures ranging from -40°C to +120°C.
