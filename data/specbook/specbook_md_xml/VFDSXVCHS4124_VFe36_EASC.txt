3.6.6 CAN Signal.  
For full list of CAN signals, see the latest CAN DBC provided by the VinFast E/E department.  

3.6.7 Functions and Features.  

Adjustment.  
Figure 15: Adjustment Feature.  
The adjustment feature enables the MHU to send steering control signals to EASC. When the steering control is turned on, the EASC receives the signal and steers accordingly. Various controls such as UpControl, DownControl, LeftControl, and RightControl are used to adjust the tilt and telescope positions. The EASC then sends the current position values back to the MHU for confirmation.  

Memorize.  
Figure 16: Memorize Feature.  
The memorize feature allows the EASC to store and recall current tilt and telescope positions. Once the column position is sent by EASC to MHU, it is stored for future use. The system can retrieve these positions when required to set the column to the user's specified profile.

3.6.8 Position concept.

Figure 17: Recovery Feature – This figure illustrates the recovery feature within the system, showing the sequential interaction among BCM, MHU, and EASC, including feedback checks and warning mechanisms.

Figure 18: Position concept – This figure describes the position concept of EASC, with normal position values ranging from EASC_TiltPos 0~100 (0x64) and EASC_TelePos 0~100 (0x64).

### 4 Testing and validation and DVP&R

DVP and PV test responsibility follows the RASIC model. Both virtual and physical testing (DVP) are performed for System, Sub-system, and Component Level, in line with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase. A detailed test plan for hardware is documented in the DVP&R file and requires collaboration with the Testing & Validation department, covering:

- **Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement**
- **Description of testing setup with pictures**, detailing the devices used for testing
- **Location of testing**, specifying whether internal or external
- **Duration and time flow of testing**, presented in the project plan format
- **Part variant and description**
- **Number of tested components/parts**

Ensure the Mileage Target Life of 160,000 km or 10 years, whichever comes first. For detailed test specifications, refer to testing plan VFDSXVCHS4133.

4.1 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.  
AAR is a PPAP deliverable.  

The AAR process is described in the VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing).  

For each step of the process, the supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  

The process will start in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS.  

The supplier has to include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.

<page number="33">
5.1 Homologation and safety regulation requirements.

5.1.1 North America.

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. European, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.

b. Self-certification and test report(s).
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s) or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance. The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  
(*) Refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer_Handbook.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of non-compliance with a FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations.
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with a FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

5.1.2 Europe.

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.

b. Test report(s) and Certificate(s).
The supplier is responsible for getting their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale.

7 Supplier responsibilities  
Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier Responsibilities are itemised to help mitigate the risk to the organisation of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.  

**Customer service requirements**  
- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup:**  
  The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

- **Spare Parts Support Cycle:**  
  The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need ensure life cycles of project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.  

- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts:**  
  The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).
