5. Description and scope of work.

5.1. Technical requirement.

5.1.1. Project Requirements.

5.1.1.1. Quality Requirements.

Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements.”  
The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.  

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.  

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistic specifications etc.).  

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.  

The components are to be laid out such that the functions in connection with and to the adjacent systems are ensured.  

- The system/the component should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000km, whichever comes first.  
- Should be designed for high-volume production.  
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime (unless activated).  
- Be fully functional as part of the active hood system when sensors are triggered.  
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.  

5.1.1.2. Certification.

- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing, and component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.  
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. Supplier must complete all component/subsystem tests.
</page>

<page number="9">
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.
- In any event, the supplier is obligated to complete all specified test requirements.
- The component/subsystem supplier must provide VINFAST's product release engineer with a complete component/subsystem test certification plan approved by the engineer. The plan shall include at least: number of samples, test sequence, place and time of each test.

### 5.1.2. General Description of the System / Component
It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification have to be agreed between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.

The system developer commits himself to:
- Develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design-process in order to achieve system-specific requirements.
- Ensure the fulfillment of all laws and ratings of system markets. No modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.

For technical proposals exceeding the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time-schedule.

The technical and commercial release will be processed by the customer based on change management.

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of system markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the Class B and C common platform.

VINFAST will monitor ongoing changes to rating protocols to ensure the full vehicle target is achieved at SOP.

Suppliers will deliver the system as a module (including all relevant add-on parts). Add-on parts include:
- Drawings
- Simulations
- Quality regulations
- Results/documentation of test validation
- Documentation of the FMEA

All parts of the assembly must be matched to each other. Functional dimensions must fulfill prescribed requirements.

5.1.5.14. Recycling.

**Recycled Materials.**  
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’). Secondary raw materials, such as post-consumer recycles and post-production recyclers (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.), are preferred based on their market availability. Recycled materials must be marked according to the parts marking standards defined in this specification book and reported to the environmental compliance experts’ team at VINFAST.

**Recycling Scheme.**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements for the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  
Design for the recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The contractor must provide a recycling scheme showing a simple layout for the potential recycling process, which includes:
- Preferred recycling partners.
- Cost estimation.

The recycling scheme is to be delivered to VINFAST’s environmental experts’ team before the PTO (Production Try-Out) milestone.
