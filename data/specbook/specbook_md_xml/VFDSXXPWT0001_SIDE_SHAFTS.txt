### 3.5 Traceability
For part requirements, follow specification. Please refer to VinFast standards VFDST00010502 and VFDST00010501.

### 3.6 Labeling of Parts
Suppliers must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Figures must be created to indicate the position where labels should be affixed on parts. Labels' setup must include pictures.

## 4 Testing and Validation and DVP&R
Testing and PC test responsibility follow RASIC standards. DVP (Virtual and physical testing) for system, sub-system, and component levels must align with the Complete Vehicle Specification Book in the concept phase. A detailed test plan for hardware tests is outlined in the file DVP&R. Collaboration with the Testing & Validation department is necessary.

### Testing Requirements:
- Testing must adhere to declarations of standards, norms, and legal requirements.
- Description of testing setup with pictures must indicate how and with which devices the testing was performed.
- Documentation must specify the locations (internal or external) where testing was performed.
- Project plans must reflect the duration and time flow of the testing.
- A description of the part or part variant must be included.
- Detailed records of tested components/parts must be maintained.
- Goals must ensure a Mileage Target Life of 160,000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first).

### 4.1 Function Safety (FUSA)
The supplier must ensure:
- Compliance with IATF 16949:2016 standards, which define the Quality Management System requirements for automotive production.
- Compliance with ISO 26262:2018 standards, which address the functional safety requirements for road vehicles.

### 4.2 Operational Strength
#### 4.2.1 General
Verification must ensure:
- Sufficient operational strength concerning vehicle-typical operational conditions.
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile.

The defined content applies fully to the respective subsystem unless otherwise stated. Validation activities specifically required for respective subsystems are outlined in this section.
</page>

<page number="26">
DVP&R on component level to be created by the supplier in accordance to fulfillment of complete vehicle targets.

4.2.2 Static load cases.
Static load cases are defined to calculate the cross sectional forces within the front and rear axle for specific maneuvers. The applied loads, so called input loads, are forces and torques which occur in the event of the respective maneuver. The input loads, boundary conditions, and maneuvers are subject to adaption.

4.2.3 Operating load.
Operating loads are the loads occurring during the intended use of the vehicle. Basis for the dimensioning of the operating strength is the maximum load and overall damage target, which is valid for all components and systems that are not defined as wearing parts. 

The statistical proof must be performed on the component level with the defined dimensioning load spectra. Environmental impacts (temperature, corrosion, wasted water among other things) must be considered. 

For safety-relevant components, additional safety factors must be considered (depending on material and loading type). Appropriate definitions must be considered in the system and component technical specification books. 

The relevant test tracks for testing operational loads include:
- Rough road durability run, 
- Drive train shortened durability run, 
- Lateral force durability run, 
- On-road durability run, etc.

The vehicle must be dimensioned to withstand operational loads without any damage for the entire target life. The drive shafts, as part of the system, must withstand the testing items as defined in the DVP&R under the sections:
- Complete vehicle durability testing,
- System tests durability.

Critical failures which may lead to a loss of vehicle control must not occur. Testing details, evaluation criteria, and loading program are to be found in the respective testing standard.

4.2.4 Load of exceptional maneuvers and misuse loads.
**Exceptional maneuver.**
Exceptional maneuvers are occurrences of small quantity (approx. < 100), belonging to the intended use of the vehicle. Examples include abs-braking, μ-Split/μ-sprung start, etc. The vehicle must be dimensioned to withstand exceptional maneuvers without any negative effect on functionality.

**Misuse maneuver.**
Misuse maneuvers are not part of the intended use of the vehicle. Examples include curbstone impact, bump, and pothole tests. The vehicle must be dimensioned for:
- Damages after misuse must be clearly recognizable for the driver (customer), e.g. steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.
</page>

<page number="27">
A defined damage chain is to be kept in the event of misuse.

A clearly recognizable plastic deformation of the concerning part or neighboring part must occur along with cracks and damages. It is aimed for deformation before breakage. The definition of exceptional maneuvers and misuse loads is stated in the referred document above.  

The subsystem rear axle has to withstand the testing items as defined in the DVP&R under the sections:
- Complete vehicle exceptional maneuver and misuse.

Testing details, evaluation criteria, and loading program are to be found in the respective testing standard.

### 4.3 Function test

Functional testing is performed to ensure the functionality of the system under certain environmental conditions and loadings. The drive shafts, as part of the subsystem, have to undergo the testing items as defined in the DVP&R in the section "Complete vehicle functional testing."

The test items listed are not exhaustive, as the complete vehicle performs a large number of functional tests during the development process, which are of different concerns. The rear axle and its single parts must not fail in its function and must fulfill the required functional target values if the nature of the test is considered as intended use of the vehicle.

Testing details, evaluation criteria, and loading program are to be found in the respective testing standard.

#### Complete vehicle testing
All physical testing must be performed in accordance with the released testing standard. Following tests are performed by VinFast:

**Complete vehicle durability testing** 
- The rough road durability run
- Lateral force durability run
- Drive train shortened durability run
- Long-distance durability run (mixed circuit)
- Ambient temperature assumption between -40°C to 50°C  

**Exceptional maneuver** 
The design and development process covers the following maneuvers: 
- ABS braking forward/rearward
- Vehicle towing
- Vehicle jacking
- Bump and pothole test (at lower speed)
- Shift-down test  

#### Scope of exceptional maneuvers and evaluation criteria
- Must be agreed upon in the operational strength integration team for the respective vehicle project.
- Vehicle towing.
</page>

<page number="28">
The results of the exceptional maneuvers have to be evaluated in cooperation with the operational strength integration team concerning number of occurrence and load heights.

**Misuse maneuver**  
The design and development process covers following misuse maneuvers:  
- Curb stone impact test  
- Jump start  
- Bump and Pothhole test (at higher speed)  
- Extreme braking  
- Drive shaft misuse test  

**Scope of misuse maneuvers and evaluation criteria:**  
- Must be agreed in the operational strength integration team for the respective vehicle project.  

The results of the misuse maneuvers have to be evaluated in cooperation with the operational strength integration team concerning number of occurrence and load heights.
