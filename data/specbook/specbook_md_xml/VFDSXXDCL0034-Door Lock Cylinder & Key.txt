Make sure that the components cannot be displaced or dismounted unintentionally.

The key lock cylinder and key barrel are vital components of the door locking system. Their primary function is to control the locking and unlocking of doors through the mechanical action of rotating the key. Easy operation, high-quality impression, and functions affecting safety must remain consistent throughout the entire lifespan of the vehicle under all prevailing operating conditions.

Key lock cylinder diagrams illustrate the structure and dimensions necessary for its integration into the locking system. Various views depict its placement within the door structure and its interaction with other components.

The key blade over molding design is shown alongside the key fob. The supplier scope involves matching the molding feasibility with the key blade and producing the parts. The key blade over molding includes satin chrome plating. Key blade and key fob designs emphasize bright chrome plated and matte black finishes for standardization and aesthetic enhancement across all markets.

Status  
Functional Responsibility  

The supplier is responsible for ensuring that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain UN-ECE regulations at authorized technical service(s). The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  

VinFast also requests suppliers to provide supporting documentation and technical information, including drawings, to be submitted to the relevant authorities in order to obtain certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if applicable).  

The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.  

**Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations:**  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

#### 5.1 Technical Deliverables  

**Work Interface Chart (RASI):**  
The main supplier obligations are described in the work interface chart (RASI). The status of the supplier (“System Development Supplier”) is defined in System/Component Specification.  

RASI is defined as follows:  
- **R: Responsible**  
  Responsible for proper execution of the activities to fulfill the requirements. She/he is entitled to request the necessary support from other project team members.  

- **A: Approval**  
  Obligation to decide; responsible for release. If no decider is defined, the person responsible for execution "R" is the decider.  

- **S: Support**  
  Obligated to provide active support (even if this requires capacity, expenses, and/or transfer of know-how). This project team member must proactively assist the person responsible for execution "R" in achieving the targets.  

- **I: Information**  
  Right to information. This team member is entitled to demand information from "R".

**6 Supplier Responsibilities**

The supplier is accountable to assure all deliverables are completed. The supplier’s responsibilities include mitigating risks, achieving contractual obligations, and adhering to customer service requirements. An essential obligation is ensuring that after-sales spare parts are available at startup.
</page>

<page number="18">
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

### Spare Parts Support Cycle
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need to ensure life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

### Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as:
- BOM table
- Parts structure and function description
- Fault diagnosis
- Special tools for maintenance
- Relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.)
