If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).  

1.2 Language.  
This document is written in English.  
All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.  

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.  
The following wording rules are used throughout this document:  

**Shall**  
The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.

**Should**  
The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.

**May**  
The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.  

**Requirements traceability:**

Figure 3: DPSM Block Diagram.

The DPSM block diagram illustrates the system layout for VFe35 Full, VFe35 Mid US, and VFe35 Mid EU. The driver seat includes memory capabilities, while the passenger seat does not have memory functionality. Passenger switch blocks serve dual purposes of resistance for track and power operations for additional systems. Seat heating and ventilation, controlled by SHVU across all variants, involve approximately 25 signal and power lines shared between the front row seats (only SHVU and movement). Seat track information from both driver and passenger seats is sent via PSM-D.

Figure 4: APSM Block Diagram.

The APSM block diagram represents the system layout for VFe35 Base US and VFe35 Base EU. Passenger switch blocks, similar to driver switch blocks, perform dual functions of resistance for track and power systems. The APSM system exclusively utilizes track signal functionality. Signal and power handover between front row seats (approximately six lines) is used solely for tracking purposes, with PSM-D handling seat track data dissemination between driver and passenger seats.

Memory seats, with memory functionality, are power-adjusted seats where favorite seating positions can be saved in the vehicle's memory. These positions can be recalled anytime with the push of a button/switch.  

**4. Power Lumbar Support:**  
Lumbar support promotes good posture by propping up the natural curvature of the spine. The bottom of the seat back extends outwards, acting as a wedge between the user's back and the car's seat to support the lower back's natural inward curvature, preventing this fragile region from bearing the body's weight.  

**5. Front Pass Seat Ventilation:**  
User activates front passenger seat ventilation by setting the required level of cooling via the MHU.  
- Vehicle should be in Motor-ON state.  
- User can activate/deactivate the feature.  
- The MHU provides an interface to activate the function by setting the required level of seat cooling.  
- Levels of cooling provided are High, Mid, and Low.
