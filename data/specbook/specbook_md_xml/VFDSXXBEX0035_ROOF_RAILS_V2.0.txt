### 3.7.1 Test Plan

The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. 

For tests, the B2P SUP is contracted.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The B2P SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the B2P SUP site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VinFast/B2P SUP.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the cost of B2P SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting must be paid for by B2P SUP if they are responsible for the failure.

The following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- No. of tested components/parts.

The B2P SUP is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by VF testing department.

The B2P SUP has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimen are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.

Upon request, the B2P SUP must use a test plan for each single component.

VinFast Management System

VFDSXXBEX0035

3.7.2 Test plan example  
The DVP must be updated weekly addressing the following items by the supplier.

3.7.3 Testing  
3.7.3.1 General  
The B2P SUP provides a detailed testing plan in accordance with the vehicle timing chart and ensures that the worst-case component/system variant is tested.  

To avoid duplicate testing, mechanical and electrical tests must be combined wherever possible. The supplier must download the VinFast test standards from the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC.  

Unless otherwise agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be included in the delivery. The component developer must ensure compliance with all relevant legislations and that all internal VF requirements outlined in the performance specification are met.  

Test results must be fully documented with photographs in test reports and shared with VF. All obligations for laws in the target markets must be met.  

All tests are required to be documented in alignment with the VinFast standard, or the B2P SUP standard if agreed by VF.  

The B2P SUP must plan and conduct tests for all development stages in accordance with specifications and provide test results using the required DVP&R template (attached to the submission).  

Sample inspections must be provided on time or by the agreed-upon date, in coordination with the testing department.
</page>

<page number="13">
3.7.3.1 General.

The B2P SUP provides in time a detailed testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart. It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested. In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible. The supplier has to download the VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC. Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. All relevant target markets' law obligations have to be achieved. All tests must be documented according to VinFast standard, alternatively to B2P SUP standard, if this is accepted by VF.

3.7.3 Analyses, test-reports.

The B2P SUP has to provide measurement reports (VFDST00008900) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during the prototype generations. After individual tests, the test samples have to be analyzed in detail.

VFDSXXBEX0035  

3.7.5 Documentation of result  
- Short description of the result (pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of result OK/NOK, pictures of the parts in testing position, etc.)  
- Comparison with results of the specification book, testing specification, legal requirements, etc.  
- Recommendation.  
- Description of corrective measures or further approach in case of negative test result.  
- Progressional testing status.  
- Listing of all tests in a table with responsible person, part status, comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the B2P SUP has to provide a new date for re-test with countermeasures to VF for approval, including the responsible person and company conducting the test.  

The VF test engineer must be informed within 2 working days in the event of negative test results. The VF test engineer has to be informed in periodic intervals with actual status and progress.  

If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.  

3.7.6 Archival storage of tested parts  
Testing parts are only allowed to be scrapped if the VinFast test department agrees to it. On demand of the test engineer, the complete testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.  

3.7.7 Virtual testing  
Suitable calculation methods are to be used and adequately detailed calculation models created by the B2P SUP for the purpose of securing, verifying, and effectively optimizing the component properties defined in the technical specification, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations.  

- The requirements related to the mechanical properties of the component, such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, are to be secured through FEM calculations.  
- The tool-dimensioning for injection molding is to be optimized through corresponding simulations.  
- On request, the operative calculation models that represent the respective development status must be provided at any time to the requesting technical departments of VF for internal calculations and integration work.  
- On request from VinFast, the B2P SUP must provide suitable FEM models free of charge.  
- The tests from the B2P SUP, according to the evaluation plan, must be calculatively documented (e.g., FEM) prior to tool dimensioning.  

3.7.8 Component testing  
The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed upon between VF, VinFast, and the B2P SUP and is binding.  

3.7.9 Mechanical integration tests  
The following test will be performed as mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle:  
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100).
</page>

<page number="15">
VinFast Management System  
VFDSXXBEX0035  
  
3.7.9 Mechanical integration tests  
The following tests will be performed as mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle:  
- **Climatic change test (VFDST00046100)**  
- **Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800)**  
- **Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000)**  
- **Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600)**  

No distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range according to VTS is allowed. The behavior of parts, especially those made of materials with high and varying thermal expansion coefficients, must be maintained.  

The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.  

If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, detailed descriptions of the parts must be attached.  
Parts required for testing activities at VinFast test department must be provided by the B2P SUP free of charge.  

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts  
Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing).  

For each step in the process, suppliers are responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to secure OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  

The approval process will begin in the early PT build phase to secure AAR Approval by LS.  

Suppliers must include this activity in their development process and ED&D costs.
