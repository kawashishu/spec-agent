### 3 Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions

For BEV vehicles, cooling hoses and pipes provide coolant flow using YA-992 (a mixture of ethylene glycol, unique inhibitors such as organic acid salts and tolyltriazole, and water: 93.3% EG, 3.9% inhibitors, and 2.8% water) to support components such as the DCDC, EDS (Electric Drive System), OBC (On Board Charger), and the battery. The main function of cooling hoses and pipes is to provide flexible connections between moving components, such as the e-motor, and fixed components in the vehicle including the radiator, expansion tank, and pumps. These lines must permit high-temperature coolant flow while being flexible enough to absorb e-motor movements without ruptures, load transmission, or significant flow restrictions. The shape and size of these cooling lines vary as required by the system.

The cooling lines must distribute coolant throughout the various components in the cooling and heating systems of the vehicle while withstanding continuous pressure and temperature fluctuations. The functional requirements for cooling hoses are as follows:

1. **Connections**:  
   - Hoses must be securely attached to connections using POPP-clamps (Pre-Open-Pre-Position) clamps or quick connectors.  

2. **Operational Efficiency**:  
   - Cooling lines must perform efficiently in high-stress environments involving heat, pressure/vacuum, and blow-by gases. These factors can cause rapid heat aging in many plastic and rubber materials.  

3. **Flexible Connections**:  
   - The connections must isolate e-motor vibrations and noise from the ducting system. They should allow for maximum allowable offset and compression to prevent early failure or excess forces on the turbocharger and air inlet components.  

4. **Movement Absorption**:  
   - Certain hoses must accommodate movements between the e-motor and other cooling system components. Lines should be flexible to withstand e-motor rolling conditions.  

5. **Material and Cleanliness**:  
   - Cooling lines must be cleaned of debris and made from materials that prevent debris loosening during operation. Outside surfaces of hoses should be cleaned using market-available washing agents.  

6. **Interior Coating**:  
   - Fluorosilicone interior coating is recommended for high resistance to oil and coolant, providing enhanced protection against hose deterioration.  

7. **Quick Connector Availability**:  
   - Quick connectors mounted on cooling lines must be readily available at car service stations as complete hose assemblies or replaceable with high accuracy and care.

### Temperatures and Pressures  

The coolant temperature in BEV E-drive and heating loops may range between -30°C and 95°C, while ambient air temperatures may range from -40°C to 105°C. Normal working temperatures are below 90°C, but during soak conditions, ambient temperatures could rise to 105°C and coolant temperatures to 90°C. The pressure varies between -10 kPA and 100 kPa overpressure.
