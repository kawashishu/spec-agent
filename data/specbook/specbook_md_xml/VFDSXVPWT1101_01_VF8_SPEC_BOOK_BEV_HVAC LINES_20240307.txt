### VF8 CATL BASE FACELIFT PHASE-2 THERMAL LAYOUT.
The VF8 CATL base facelift phase-2 thermal layout diagram illustrates the vehicle's thermal system design. It includes key components like the EDS radiator, battery radiator, high-voltage (HV) battery, pumps, and sensors. The thermal system is categorized into loops such as the battery loop, EDS loop, and AC loop, which are interconnected to manage thermal regulation efficiently. The layout also specifies cooling and heating processes within the system using components like the CPDU, WCC chiller, and HVAC front unit.

### VF8 CATL PLUS FACELIFT PHASE-2 THERMAL LAYOUT.
The VF8 CATL plus facelift phase-2 thermal layout provides a detailed schematic of an advanced thermal system. It shares similarities with the base layout but includes additional enhancements and components to optimize thermal performance. The system features elements such as AC compressors, HP/L sensors, and additional piping loops. This layout demonstrates the integration of advanced thermal management for future vehicle performance and efficiency.

2 Specification summary.  

**Technical requirements summary (1):**  
Refer to DVP for Targets and acceptance criteria.  

- **Material:**  
  Al3103 / GY4882 / GY4890 / Al 6061 – T6 / EPDM / Al 5052 – H32 / PA66 / 10B21 / DC01  

- **Functional / Performance:**  
  In these pipe installations, freon (e.g., R134a, R1234yf) mixed with compressor oil (e.g., PAG/POE synthetic oil) acts as a refrigerant. It circulates in the system where it undergoes continuous pressure and temperature fluctuations.
