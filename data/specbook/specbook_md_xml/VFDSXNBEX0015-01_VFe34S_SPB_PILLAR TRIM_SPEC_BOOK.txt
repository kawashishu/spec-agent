11 RR_DR_C_PILLAR_TRIM_LH has the part number BEX71015071. It is made of ABS+PC material, weighs 0.138 kg, and is purchasable. This part is available for VFe 34S ECO and PLUS variants in VN, EU, and NA regions.

12 RR_DR_C_PILLAR_TRIM_RH has the part number BEX71015081. It is made of ABS+PC material, weighs 0.138 kg, and is purchasable. This part is available for VFe 34S ECO and PLUS variants in VN, EU, and NA regions.

**Description:**
A, B, & C post cappings are part of the Exterior Ornamentation for VFe 34S. They are mounted on the A, B & C door pillars of the vehicle (RH & LH) and have an interference fit with rear door system, front door system, seals, and door finishers. They are controlled with 6 degrees of freedom using primary, secondary, and tertiary datums defined below in the datum strategy.

**Legal Requirements:**
These parts are high-gloss painted plastics (PC+ABS). They have a legal requirement under ECE R26 for exterior projections check, ensuring the edges respect legal radius requirements.

**Manufacturability:**
The manufacturing method is injection molding. The parts are expected to be consistent and capable of close control. Painting is conducted in-house at VinFast for pillar trims.

**Defects:**
The component is required to be free from defects such as flash, sprues, gates, weld lines, surface blemishes, and mold release agents.

**Performance:**
The component must perform reliably under all conditions. Its dimensions should remain stable, showing no color or gloss changes. It must withstand extreme conditions ranging between -40Â°C and +100Â°C without deterioration.

**Material Properties:**
Material properties provided by the manufacturer typically refer to frequencies in the MHz-range and below. In higher frequencies, the material's properties significantly differ from the data sheets. The material roughness is expected to be below lambda/10 (â‰¤ ~400 Âµm). Materials used for the bumper's structural surface must adhere to the following properties:
- Synthetic materials with low dielectric loss factors at specific radar frequencies to achieve low transition damping.
- Synthetic materials with low dielectric constants (Îµr) to ensure low surface reflection.

**Painting:**
The secondary surface can be painted, but dedicated analysis and control of various possible painting categories are mandatory to avoid significant performance degradation. Generally, the secondary surface will consist of several layers including primer, paint, and varnishes. Together, these layers alongside the base material will influence surface reflection properties and transmission damping.

It is prohibited to use metallic materials for secondary surfaces as they degrade sensor radiation. Validation is essential for elements containing metallic particles. The applicability of metallic paintings depends on:
- The percentage of metal content in the paint.
- The size and shape of the metal particles within the paint.
- The number and thickness of different layers of painting and primers.

<page number="7">
The number of painting layers shall not exceed four, considering the maximum one-way attenuation.
