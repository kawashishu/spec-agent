### 3.2.1 Component / System Description

The Dual-Function Mirror is a part of indirect vision devices that provides a clear view of the rear of the vehicle to the driver, within the field of vision. It functions as a normal rearview mirror, allowing the driver to see rearward through the vehicle's rear window. Additionally, it can be switched to a display unit that projects images or video from a high-resolution camera system installed in the rear spoiler.

In "traditional mode," the reflectivity of the mirror glass can be controlled via an EC cell behind the glass to reduce glare from traffic behind. A sensor within the mirror measures incoming light intensity and controls the dimming function. This system is particularly useful in cases where rearview visibility is restricted by passengers or objects in the rear seats or boot.

This system provides enhanced live rearview functionality, improving visibility for the driver.

#### FSS Responsibility
The system operates under Full Service Supplier (FSS) responsibility, meaning the supplier has complete accountability for the supplied system within the defined system boundaries. The supplier delivers the parts as a module, ensuring all relevant add-on parts are pre-integrated.

#### Functional Responsibility
- All assembly parts must be precisely matched to each other.
- Functional dimensions must adhere to the prescribed specifications.

#### Weight Target
The target weight for the mirror assembly must not exceed 650 grams.

The system developer is tasked with creating all technical solutions and meeting requirements based on available vehicle and design data throughout the design process to achieve:
- Component requirements.
- Compliance with all laws and regulations across selling markets.

#### Visual Description
The system comprises the following elements:
- **DFM ASSY:** Dual-Function Mirror Assembly.
- **Camera System:** Provides live digital imaging functionality.
- **FOV (Field of Vision):** Ensures expansive rearward visibility.
- **Digital/Electrical Interface:** Connects electrical components for complete functional integration.

<page number="11">
3.2.2 Functions

3.2.2.1 Main Functions
- Provide indirect view of the rear traffic.
- Adjust the field of view for different seat positions.

Mirror assembly will be attached to the windscreen. The supplier is responsible for defining and developing the attachment. The attachment should be robust enough to prevent NVH and also meet Head Impact requirements.

3.2.2.2 Component Functions

1. Dual Modes:
The mirror shall have two operation modes:
- Traditional mode: A light reflective surface allows the driver to see rearward scenes through the vehicle’s rear windshield.
- Digital mode: The mirror is switchable to a full-sized LCD screen to display camera images without any flickering.

2. Environment Brightness and Rear Light Detection:
Sensors to measure environment brightness and incoming light from rear traffic that might disturb the driver are to be included. The measured data should be communicated to the outer mirror for controlling the auto-dimming function of the outer mirror. In digital mode, the user shall be able to adjust brightness and contrast of the images.

3. Image Position and Pose Adjustment:
The user shall be able to adjust the image position and orientation if necessary via mechanical buttons.

Surface Finish & Texture:
Updated information will be communicated by the Color & Trim department. Below image is for reference:

**Table 3: Color and Material Information**

</page>

<page number="12">
4. Auto Dimming.
Auto Dimming automatically dims and clears the Mirror Glass based on ambient and incident light levels, thereby reducing glare. The automatic dimming feature can be toggled ON or OFF by the user. The inner mirror must provide a signal for controlling the auto-dimming feature of the outer mirrors. The supplier is responsible for additional control units if required. Variable levels of dimming must also be supported.

5. Night Adaptation.
This feature involves image processing with night exposure adjustment to enhance rearward visibility during night conditions.

6. Function Switching Interface.
The mirror shall feature a mechanical switch to allow the user to change between the traditional mirror mode and the digital display mode.

3.2.2.3 Interfaces.
The components must be designed to ensure functionality in combination with all adjoining systems and interfaces.

The concept will be defined during the engineering phase by collaboration between the supplier and VinFast. The supplier will be responsible for developing the fixation and functionality of the Inner Mirror System according to input provided by VinFast, offering feedback for any deviations occurring during the process.

The supplier will analyze and integrate any additional element required for the assembly, orientation, and fixation of the Inner Mirror System.

Interfaces must be worked out in collaboration with VinFast, with special attention to the application of quality methodologies such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA).

In cases where diverse materials (especially metallic ones) are used, precautionary steps must be taken to prevent contact corrosion.

It is essential to ensure a snug fit for the parts, even under adverse component tolerances or environmental conditions.

Relevant Module Interfaces:
- Windscreen.
- Sensor Farm Area, including Windshield Camera, Covers, and Brackets.

3.3 NVH & Driving Comfort.

**General:**
The VINFAST target system for the Inner Rear View Mirror is designed based on reference vehicles. Key requirements such as gas and water tightness form the foundation for acoustic performance and must be sufficiently achieved.

The system should operate without generating disturbing sounds, such as noise caused by relative movement, squeaking, rattling, temperature shifts, or flexural torsion, during vehicle operation. All appropriate measures should prevent or eliminate operating noises (e.g., wind and whining noises) entirely or minimize them as much as possible to achieve an acceptable noise level.

**Squeak and Rattle (S&R):**
Any effects of squeak and rattle that occur during high-speed driving, particularly under certain humidity levels, must be avoided. This can be achieved with robust profile design and surface coating processes using high-quality material pairings. Material matching should ensure adequate durability.

If required, the NVH team should assist in selecting suitable material pairings to mitigate buzz, squeak, and rattle noises.
</page>

<page number="14">
All components concerned with the seal system are designed to reduce aerodynamic resistance and optimize aero-acoustic characteristics.

Natural Frequency:
Low vibration at maximum speed must be realized to meet subjective targets. The target for the first eigenfrequency of the mirror assembly must exceed 55Hz, measured on the trimmed body.

The supplier guarantee requirements:
- No amplification of vibrations on inner mirrors.
- Avoidance of noise caused by component functions or joints due to unfavorable tolerances.
- Prevention of whistling, buzzing, squeaking, and rattling noises during high-speed driving.
- Fulfillment of all functions under all operational and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).

### 3.4 General CAE Requirements
Refer to Specification of Requirements (SOR):  
**VFSRXXCVC0201 VFCAE-001-FEM-GENERAL_Analysis requirement**

### 3.5 Material Requirements
**Prohibited or Restricted Substances, Emissions, & Toxicology:**  
The supplier must ensure adherence to prohibitions and restrictions related to substances and notification obligations for all parts (new, modified, carry-over, off-the-shelve, and spare) during the complete product life cycle. Compliance must align with **VFDST00007601**.  

Material data sheets must be submitted to the VinFast IMDS ID per the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and **VFDST00007601**.  

**Vehicle indoor air quality specifications:**  
Specific air quality targets must comply with:  
**VFDSXVCVC3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline.**  

Materials referenced in these specifications are proposals from VINFAST. The supplier is responsible for defining and confirming all materials. Suppliers must also reference the VinFast Request for Quotation and **Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).**

**Corrosion Requirements:**  
Corrosivity classifications for system components are as follows:  
1. **Corrosivity Low:** For positions not exposed to macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road salts (deicing).  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** For positions moderately exposed to macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road salts (deicing).  
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default classification for all exterior positions directly exposed to road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default classification for positions directly exposed to road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.
</page>

<page number="15">
The vehicle Exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets, and in case of a critical material combination, proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers). 

Avoid water and dirt accumulation while always providing drainage in the lowest positions. Dirt traps should be avoided, as sand can work as an abrasive, damaging the painted body through micro movements. Contact surfaces to the body must remain dry, large enough for low pressure, and comprised of non-abrasive material. Additionally, micro-movement should be minimized. Burr-free edges and paint systems with good edge coverage must be ensured.

**Corrosion Tests**  
The parts must pass both system/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests:

**Component test for Metallic surfaces:**  
Salt spray test: *ISO 9227 (refer to acceptance criteria below).*  

**For Organic coatings:**  
Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): *ISO11997 Cycle B (refer to acceptance criteria below).*  

Alternative tests may be proposed by the supplier but must be accepted by the corrosion engineer.

**Test Criteria:**

</page>

<page number="17">
Material combinations must be selected to prevent galvanic corrosion. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. 

Direct contact with noble metals such as steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness should be avoided. Steel fasteners must be surface-treated to ensure long-term corrosion resistance and compatibility with other materials. 

Electrical components must be installed securely to prevent vibrations that can cause fretting corrosion. 

Terminals and connectors:
- Terminals must not be placed at the lowest points to avoid corrosion risks.
- Electrical connections require tightness and protection from humidity.
- Grounding surfaces exposed to corrosive environments must be water-tight.

Aluminium sealing surfaces:
- Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content above 1% should be avoided for sealing components as corrosion may penetrate seals quickly, allowing moisture to enter.

Prevention of stone chipping issues:
- Shield vulnerable parts by design wherever possible.
- Use larger radii in parts exposed to high-risk areas to mitigate severe impacts.
- Select materials and paint with matching colors for high-risk areas to reduce visible marks.
- Avoid designs with edges pointed in the vehicle’s driving direction.
- Chromed elements at lower vehicle areas must be recessed to minimize stone impact risks.

### 3.6 Traceability
Follow VinFast standard VFDST00010501 for part traceability requirements.

### 3.7 Labeling of Parts 
Suppliers must adhere to VinFast standard VFDST00000010 when positioning labels, providing a visual setup with reference images.

### 3.8 Operational Strength (Stiffness / Strength / Durability)
- Ensure sufficient operational strength to meet all vehicle-specific operational conditions, including loads and special events.
- Verify product characteristics derived from application profiles.
- Define requirements ensuring the operational strength of vehicle subsystems and components is adequate as specified, including structural stiffness and durability.
- Mounting force for components must be lower than the dismounting force.
</page>

<page number="18">
## 18 | Functional Responsibility

### Operating Loads:
Operating loads refer to the forces and conditions experienced during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are determined through benchmarking with base vehicles under specific test conditions defined by VF.

The definition of customer usage is based on VinFast’s MCE (mixed circuit Europe), which includes long-distance durability testing. The tested mileage reflects the target customer mileage requirement for the vehicle, set at **160,000 km**.

### Vehicle Lifetime:
The vehicle's expected lifetime is a minimum of **10 years**.

### Environmental Operating Conditions:
The vehicle must function effectively under the following environmental conditions:
- **Temperature Range:** -35°C to +90°C ambient.
- **Humidity Levels:** 0% to 100% relative humidity.
- **Altitude Range:** -100 meters to 3,500 meters above mean sea level.
</page>

<page number="19">
Special events:  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking. The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.

Misuse events:  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., kerbstone impact. The vehicle must be dimensioned such that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or at neighboring components (principle “deformation before break”).

3.9 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts  
AAR is a PPAP deliverable.  

The AAR process is described in the VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing). For each step of the process, Supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  

The process will start in early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS. Supplier has to include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.
</page>

<page number="20">
4 Testing and Validation.

4.1 Test plan.

The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the FSS SUP has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of his component lies with the FSS SUP. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The FSS SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the FSS SUP site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VinFast/FSS SUP.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the cost of FSS SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting costs are to be borne by FSS SUP if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data must be included in the DVP&R:

The FSS SUP is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by VF testing department. The initial data filling has to be done by the FSS SUP and submitted to VF (at least 4 weeks after the nomination of the FSS SUP). The FSS SUP must plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan must be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the FSS SUP. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department (VF), SQA (VinFast), and the FSS SUP before concept confirmation. After this approval, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly.

In case of any scheduling delay, the FSS SUP must deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule. Upon request, the FSS SUP draws up a test plan for each single component.

4 Testing and Validation.

4.1 Test plan.  
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the FSS SUP has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.  

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.  

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.  

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of his component has the FSS SUP. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on a committed schedule. The FSS SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the FSS SUP site or their testing centers.  

Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VinFast/FSS SUP.  

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or a different testing procedure, the testing has to be redone on the costs of FSS SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting has to be paid by FSS SUP if they are responsible for the failure.  

Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:  
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.  
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).  
- Responsible test department.  
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).  
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in the form of a project plan).  
- Part variant, description of part.  
- Number of tested components/parts.
