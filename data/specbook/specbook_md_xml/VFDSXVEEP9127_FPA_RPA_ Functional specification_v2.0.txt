12.4 / Function Description.

The functions of PDC are divided into two parts: FPA function and RPA function. Details are as follows:  
- **System:** PDC  
  - **Sub System:** Rear Parking Assist.  
    - **Function Description:** The RPA warning is actively switched on when the driver is backing up. This function is used to prompt the distance information of the obstacles behind the vehicle. Different colors and sounds with different frequencies represent the distance relationship between the obstacles and the vehicle.  
  - **Sub System:** Front Parking Assist.  
    - **Function Description:** If the system is set to automatically turn on the HMI, the FPA will automatically turn on after power-on. When the driver advances at a low speed, obstacle distance information in the direction of the vehicle will be prompted. Different colors and different frequencies of sounds indicate the distance between the obstacle and the vehicle.

The PDC function works under the IGN ON power (STAT_CL_15_1_L = 1 ON) supply, and its working speed range is: The working speed is 0 ~ 15km/h in D/N/R gear. In order to adapt to BEV and ICE models at the same time, there are two gear signals, but there can only be one on the car, which needs to be compatible.

12.4.4.2 / Alarm And Display Requirement.

Requirement ID: FS-226543.  
Type: Functional.  
Status: Accepted.

PDC sound alarm request:  
When the PDC needs to alert, the PDC controller will send 8 USS alarm signals ADAS_PA_Alert to MHU.  
The alarm frequency of PDC sound is defined by MHU.  
PDC needs to define the alarm area segment according to the following example:  

**RPA/FPA Alarm Area:**  
- ≤30cm: 1st warning.  
- 31~45cm / 30~60cm: 2nd warning.  

**USS Map:**  
1, 2, 3, 4 represent FPA sensors.  
5, 6, 7, 8 represent RPA sensors.  
The diagram demonstrates the placement of front-left corner (FLC), front-middle (FLM), front-right corner (FRC), rear-left corner (RLC), rear-middle-left (RLM), rear-middle-right (RRM), and rear-right corner (RRC) sensors.
</page>

<page number="18">
46~60cm and 60~90cm correspond to a 3rd warning.  
61~90cm corresponds to a 4th warning.  
91~120cm and 120cm correspond to a 5th warning.  

Failure of any USS in front of the vehicle will make the FPA system unavailable.  
Failure of any USS behind the vehicle will make the RPA system unavailable.  

### 12.4.4.3 / Response Time Requirements  

**Requirement ID:** FS-226544  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** Accepted  

Alarm response time: The standard obstacle is first placed in the detection area, and the time from activation (hanging R gear) to the alarm sound of the horn is measured. The time requirement cannot exceed 1.5s.  

Obstacle detection response time: After the system is activated, measure the time from when an obstacle appears in the monitoring range to when the buzzer emits an alarm sound. The time requirement cannot exceed 500ms.  

### 12.4.4.4 / Fault Detected  

**Requirement ID:** FS-226545  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** Accepted

### 12.4.4.4.1 / Step 1  

**Requirement ID:** FS-226546  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** Accepted

<page number="19">
12.4.4.4.2 / Step 2.

Requirement ID: FS-226547. Type: Functional. Status: Accepted.  

After the failure of USS, the USS alarm information should be set to 0.  

12.4.4.4.3 / Step 3.

Requirement ID: FS-226548. Type: Functional. Status: Accepted.  

The temporary fault status and permanent fault status of signal ADAS_RPA_check or signal ADAS_FPA_check are determined by the information provided by USS.  

12.4.4.4.4 / Step 4.

Requirement ID: FS-226549. Type: Functional. Status: Accepted.  

The PDC self-check found that the system failure caused FPA and RPA to fail to work, and the PA state signal entered the Failed state. Otherwise, go directly to Standby state.  
When the system meets the FPA or RPA working conditions, PA state will automatically enter the Active state.  
When both RPA and FPA are in failure state, the PA state signal jumps to the failure state.  

12.4.4.5 / Settings.

Requirement ID: FS-226550. Type: Functional. Status: Accepted.

12.4.4.5.1 / FPA Default status Settings.

Requirement ID: FS-226551.  
Type: Functional.  
Status: Accepted.  

There is a default open/close setting item for FPA on HMI, which is used to set whether this function is on or off when power is on.  
When the driver sets the FPA state, the MHU sends a signal "MHU_PA_On = on or off" to ADAS, and ADAS feeds back its own state "ADAS_PA_AutoOn_Feed = on or off" according to the input information of the MHU. MHU memorizes the driver's state, and ADAS switches its own state according to the MHU state after each power-on initialization.

12.4.4.5.2 / PA button.

Requirement ID: FS-226552.  
Type: Functional.  
Status: Accepted.  

There are two ways to use the PA button:
1. When the FPA is closed, when the user clicks this button, MHU will send the signals "MHU_PA_Button = request" and "MHU_AVM_ShowAVMReq = show" to ADAS. ADAS will turn on the FPA function and SVM function after receiving the signal.  
2. When FPA is turned on, when the user clicks this button, MHU will send the signal "MHU_AVM_ShowAVMReq = show" to ADAS. ADAS will turn on the SVM function after receiving the signal.

12.4.4.6 / RPA Trailer Inhibit RPA.

Requirement ID: FS-226553.  
Type: Functional.  
Status: Accepted.  

When the system detects the signal "TrailerDetected = 1 'Trailer detected'," the RPA function will be inhibited and will not be activated. The signal "ADAS_RPA_check = 1 'Temporarily not available'".
