### 5.0.1 System Overview  
The system developer commits to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process to achieve the project's purpose.  
The technical and commercial release will be carried out by customers following change management procedures.  

VinFast’s platform is designed to support ICE applications.  

For ICE vehicles, cooling hoses and pipes facilitate coolant flow (50% Glycol) for engine and transmission cooling systems as well as HVAC heating.  

Coolant hoses and pipes play a critical role by providing flexible connections between moving components like the engine and e-motor, and fixed components like radiators and expansion tanks within the vehicle. These lines must allow coolant flow at high temperatures, absorb movements without ruptures, and prevent load transmission or significant flow restrictions. They are designed in various shapes and sizes per system requirements.

5.0.2 System requirements.  
System supplier has to define characteristic curve/values matching thermal and mechanical requirements of hoses.  
The following requirements have to be fulfilled:  

- Geometry.  
- Acoustics, vibrations, resonances.  
- Life due to the operational profile.  
- Service and ease to repair.  

Supplier is responsible for the development and must cover all development phases to ensure system performance requirements are met. Following development activities should be led by the supplier:  

- Concept Creation System.  
- Package refinement.  
- Sizing of hoses.  
- Identification of leakage paths.  
- Evaluation of coolant flow uniformity.  
- Provide flow rate data, which will serve as a boundary condition for cooling system simulation.  

**Characteristic Curves:**  
The supplier must provide characteristic charts. Pipes should be tested to plot the characteristic curves, including pressure against temperature and pressure loss at different points.  

**Handling and Packaging Requirements:**  
No sharp edges that may cut or injure a person or damage other parts are permitted. These considerations must be discussed with VCC purchase and manufacturing engineering departments.  

**Figure Description:**  
The figure is a schematic diagram of the ICE cooling system, showing the flow of coolant between key components, such as the radiator, engine, thermostat, heater core, and pumps. Red lines represent outgoing flows, while blue lines indicate incoming flows. The main components integrate with sub-systems like the E-pump, turbocharger, and expansion tank to form the complete cooling mechanism.

5.0.2 System Requirements.  

System suppliers are required to define characteristic curves and values that match the thermal and mechanical requirements of hoses.  

The requirements that must be fulfilled include:  
- Geometry.

- Package refinement.  
- Sizing of hoses.  
- Identification of leakage paths.  
- Evaluation of coolant flow uniformity.  
- Providing flow rate data used as a boundary condition for cooling system simulations.  

**Characteristic curves:**  
Suppliers are to provide characteristic charts. Pipes must be tested to plot characteristic curves, including pressure against temperature and pressure loss at different points.  

**Handling and packaging requirements:**  
Hose components must avoid sharp edges that could cut or injure a person or damage other parts. Packaging discussions should include VinFast's VCC purchase and manufacturing engineering departments.  

The components must be packaged to prevent transportation damage. Hoses should ideally be packed in plastic boxes. If wooden boxes are used, they should have big plastic bags lining the box interior during transport.  

**Surface requirements:**  
The pipe surface should be free of folds, cracks, pores, and blisters while maintaining smooth internal surfaces. All pipes must be black in appearance except for markings.  

---

**5.0.3 Function.**  

Cooling lines are responsible for distributing coolant between various components of a vehicle’s cooling and heating systems. This involves circulating coolant under continuous pressure and temperature fluctuations.  

The functional requirements for cooling hoses are as follows:  
- The hoses must be secured to the connections using POPP-clamps (Pre Open Pre Position clamps) or quick connectors.  
- Cooling lines must maintain efficiency in hot and stressful environments involving heat, pressure/vacuums, engine oil, and blow-by gases. These conditions induce rapid heat aging in many plastic and rubber materials.  
- Flexible connections are required to isolate engine and e-motor vibrations and noise from ducting systems. Connections should be configured for maximum allowable offsets to prevent early failure and reduce excess force on turbochargers and air inlet components.  
- Certain hoses must absorb movement between the engine/e-motor and other cooling system components, remaining functional under engine rolling conditions.  
- Cooling lines must be cleaned of all debris. Prolonged operation should not result in debris entering the system, and exterior hose material must resist exposure to engine oil, fuel, brake fluid, washer fluid, and ATF oil. It should be compatible with standard engine washing agents available on the market.  
- Hoses should feature Fluorosilicone coatings on interior surfaces to resist oil and coolant, providing an added layer of protection against deterioration.  
- Quick connectors should be readily serviceable in car service stations as complete hose assemblies or fixable replacements, ensuring high accuracy and care.  

---

**5.0.4 Interfaces.**  

All components must be designed to ensure functionality in combination with adjoining systems and interfaces.  

Major interface points include:  
- AC pipes.  
- Radiator(s) and fan shroud.  
- Degas bottle.  
- Hose mounting brackets.  
- BIW (clearances, packaging, resonances, stiffness).  
- Engine mountings and hoses.  
- Transmission.  
- Chassis (clearances to chassis components, such as engine mounts and electric wiring).

**5.0.7 Connections and fixations**

Hose sealings shall unite various components in the cooling and heating systems of the cooling systems. The hose sealings will secure that no leakage will occur in any joints of the cooling system. The coolant in the system shall consist of a water and glycol mixture in a 50/50 ratio.

- **Sealings before marriage point**: All rubber hose sealings before the marriage point should have POPP clamps with spigots according to DIN3021-3.  
- **Sealings after marriage point**: All hose sealings after the marriage point should have quick connectors. Other sealings may also have quick connectors depending on packaging and assembly situations.

**Prohibited clamps:**  
No loose clamps, such as screw worm clamps, should be used.

**POPP-clamp (Pre Open Pre Position):**  
Hoses should include standard constant tension clamps or POPP clamps, along with alignment marks, unless quick connectors are required.  

- **Compatibility requirements:**  
  When using POPP-clamps, hose ends must comply with inner diameter requirements compared to spigot outer diameter. This compatibility must be verified accurately.  

- **Wall thickness for rubber hose ends (DIN 3021-3):**  
  - Inner diameter: 6.5mm - 25mm; Wall thickness: 3.5 ± 0.4mm  
  - Inner diameter: 26mm - 36mm; Wall thickness: 4.0 ± 0.4mm  

**Interference tolerance between hose and spigot:**  
- 1.0mm (inner diameter hose end ≤ 26mm)  
- 1.5mm (inner diameter hose end > 26mm)  

**Tolerances for hose end inner diameter:**  
+0 / -0.8mm

**Position of POPP-clamp on rubber hose:**  
Clamps should be positioned 5mm from the hose end, with tolerances of ±1mm.  

- **Effect of high engine temperatures:**  
  After the first heat-up of the engine (90°C), glue on the clamps will lose its stickiness.  

- **Marking requirements:**  
  Color markings should indicate both clamp position and angle on hoses.

---
</page>

<page number="12">
### Spigot Design for POPP Clamp

The spigot for POPP-clamp sealing must conform to DIN 3121-3 standards. The minimum length (Lmin) should be selected according to a 15 mm width clamp (c=15). For diameters Øds ranging from 6.5 mm to 32 mm, Lmin should be 23 mm. 

Correct verification of hose connections with POPP-clamps is mandatory.

### Position of POPP-Clamp on Rubber Hose

The clamp must be positioned at 5 mm from the hose end with a tolerance of ±1 mm. After the initial engine heat-up at 90°C, the effect of glue should dissipate. 

2D coordinates for Color Marking (CM X) must be displayed clearly for indicating clamp position and angular orientation.

### Tolerances for Clamp Angle

- **±5° for ID > 27 mm**
- **±10° for ID ≤ 27 mm**

### Tolerance for Rubber Hose

The tolerance specifications for hose diameters and angles are crucial to ensure accurate and effective connections.
</page>

<page number="13">
Tolerance for position of "Sleeve start point" is ±7.5 along the centerline.

References for hose end:  
Pictures show references for the rubber hose, including detailed diagrams. These diagrams illustrate critical dimensions and positioning requirements for sealing length and other specifications.

Color markings for rubber hose end position:  
The picture displays measurements for color markings on hose ends, highlighted in yellow.  
- Length of marking: 20 ± 1 mm  
- Width of marking: 2 ± 0.5 mm  

These specifications ensure the precise alignment and positioning of rubber hoses and their markings.
</page>

<page number="14">
## Quick connector

SAE J2044 connectors shall be used in plastic pipe as the first choice. SAE connectors could be used for rubber hose. Used quick connectors should comply with the following standards:
- SAE J2044.
- VDA.

### References for VDA QC
Picture shows an example for references regarding the VDA connector.

## Hose joint to plastic parts

Crimp rings are the preferred choice for sealing between plastic parts and hoses in complete hose units. It is the supplier's responsibility to ensure the crimp ring sealing is adequate.
</page>

<page number="15">
## Support clips

For hoses with long length, clips should be used to support hoses. This ensures the hose remains in the correct position. C-clips should only be used for hoses with an outer diameter of less than 25 mm. Clips that keep hoses in position with low movement and forces could be attached to a bracket using a round fire tree feature. The fire tree feature fits into different brackets because it is flexible regarding thickness. The hole size for the fire tree is 6.5 mm H13.  

### Use of C-clip

C-clips should only be used for hoses with an outer diameter less than 25 mm.  
During the system filling process, the vacuum step may cause hoses to collapse. This could result in routing changes where the hose escapes from the clip, causing the clip to no longer hold the hose. For hoses with an outer diameter less than 25 mm, the hose will not collapse.  

### Attachment of clip

Clips that keep hoses in position with low movement and forces could be attached to brackets using a round fire tree feature. The fire tree feature fits into different brackets and accommodates flexible thickness. The hole size for the fire tree is 6.5 mm H13.  

## 5.1 General CAE Requirements

Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL.
</page>

<page number="16">
### 5.2 Material requirement
**Prohibited or restricted substances, emissions, and Toxicology:**  
The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification must be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier throughout the complete product life cycle according to **VFDST00007601**.  

IMDS material data sheets must be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID according to the official **VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing and Validation)** and **VFDST00007601**.
