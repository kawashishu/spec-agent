Functional Responsibility  

VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS standards. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance. The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures(*) used by USA/Canada Governments to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  
(*) Refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer_Handbook.  

#### Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.  

### 4.3.2 Europe  
#### Homologation and safety regulation activities  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.  

#### Test report(s) and Certificate(s)  
The supplier is responsible for ensuring their part(s), product(s), or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale.  

VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain UN-ECE standards at authorized technical services. The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificates must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
VinFast also requests that suppliers provide supporting documentation, technical information, and drawings to be submitted to the relevant authorities to obtain certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if required).  

The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.  

#### Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

6 Supplier responsibilities.  
Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier Responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.  

**Customer service requirements:**  
**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

**Spare Parts Support Cycle:**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need to ensure life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.  

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts:**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS (Off Tool Sample), such as:  
- BOM table  
- Parts structure and function description  
- Fault diagnosis  
- Special tools for maintenance  
- Relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.)
