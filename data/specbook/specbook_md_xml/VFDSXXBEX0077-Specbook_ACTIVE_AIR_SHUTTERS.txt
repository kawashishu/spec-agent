#### 3.2 Technical requirement

**Function:**
The assembly active grille, including the air flaps, has the primary task to regulate (open and close) the air intake for the car in the front bumper area. It opens demand-oriented, providing fresh air for the cooling systems. As a result, the Cd-value is improved by controlling the airflow depending on the driving velocity.

**Details:**
- The lower grille air intake active shutter system (air flap control), including the air duct, is to be developed. The system and the air flaps are positioned behind the grill.
- The lower trim grille is not part of the development requirement.
- The active grille module interacts with the complete cooling air routing, ensuring a leak-tight connection to neighboring components.
- Vehicle-specific overall leakage flow is defined by VinFast, as well as the level of interference noise. Separate seals must be provided if needed, with a target air leakage value of no more than 8%.
- The actuator must be carried over from the existing C-SUV program.
- Flaps and the drive unit (actuator, coupling bars, etc.) must be carried over from the C-SUV program.
</page>

<page number="8">
**BOM (Bill of material)**  
All materials described in the specification book are proposals from VinFast. The system supplier is responsible for the definition and confirmation of all materials.  

### BOM: ACTIVE GRILLE CUV (Parts for both BEV and ICE)

**Table 1**: Technical information table.

This specification book contains one component (active shutters lower frame) that is used in all vehicle variants. For BEV variants in the US market, the frame shall be assembled with active vanes, which are carried over (COP) from VinFast's C-SUV program. Therefore, the component must be designed in a way that allows the existing components to be assembled with the frame.  

All functions implemented in the existing C-SUV vehicle must also be available in the D-SUV vehicle. This means limited changes are allowed in the area of the part where the vanes (flaps) are located. Any changes in this area must be aligned with VinFast, announced, and aligned before supplier nomination.  

Part of the validation may be carried over from the C-SUV program (e.g., leakage simulation, airflow). However, this requires simulation reports from the C-SUV program to be available. If the results are not available, then new simulations must be run for:  
- Air leakage.  
- Flap blockage.  
- Flap torsion and durability.  
- Frame torsion and durability.

### Vehicle Safety
The supplier is responsible to support the integration of vehicle safety functions actively. Lifetime relevant laws and ratings of selling markets (Vietnam) as well as OEM requirements must be taken into account.

#### Specific demands:
- Support pedestrian protection by development of deformation characteristics.
- In case of active pedestrian safety systems, also support sensor integration and sensor signals.
- Up to 5 local module load cases will be defined by VF.
- As an example, 1 of these 5 module load cases could be: deformation X-resistance between KN-span in specific YZ position.
- As an impactor, an UN-R21 pendulum device with certain mass/speed shall be considered; impact energy will be further detailed by VF.
- For CAE work on bumper fascia less than 8mm, as defined within general requirements, can be aspired.

#### General demands:
Unless further specific definitions are given, the following points must be considered by the supplier:
- Vehicle safety functions must be maximum prepared by on-system level expertise, CAE, and testing.
- Project relevant supplier data must be handed over to VF on request and free of charge.
- Target fulfillment of performances with spread effects must be secured by an adequate number of worst results of identical test series.
- Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand, e.g., to support and reach vehicle data freeze milestones. It must be realized within LsDyna, as well as validated, numerical and physically stable.
- FE meshes must be homogeneous according to part axes/geometry and with a density of 8–10mm. In case of non-keeping meshing guidelines, FE meshes must be reworked.
- For generating validated CAE material cards, activities must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier. This includes principle tests on systems as well as components.
- Suppliers’ test matrix must be defined according to full vehicle timing demands. Before larger scaled tests are planned (e.g., sled or vehicle crash tests), supplier optimization test series must be completed.
- Supplier-specific parts, needed for testing activities at any party of the project, must be provided by the supplier free of charge to relevant testing facilities. However, if costs for physical parts and CAE models are incurred, these costs must be taken into account by the supplier.
</page>

<page number="14">
Integration of requests pointed out from the full vehicle crash optimization process must be accepted without additional costs. This includes material definitions, material thicknesses, additional parts, and optimization work.

General requirements:
- For each single target value, a mandatory 20% safety margin has to be applied.
- Integrity of the occupant survival area versus part behavior and fluids, including parts directly or indirectly in contact with passengers.
- No edges below 3.2 mm during and after impact.
- Electrical system integrity during impact and for post-crash functions.
- Consideration of relevant tolerances.
- Robust target achievement.
- Asymmetries must be investigated on each side until a reliable worst-case is confirmed by VinFast departments.
- No modifiers for any rating.

Specific demands:
- Any tracking actions regarding observed issues must be performed, including parts, CAE models, or information from other suppliers.
- Devices such as test bucks/sleds must be set up by the supplier based on unfinished parts. For example, using a non-prepared body-in-white (BIW) for final sled testing.
- Suppliers are required to prepare homologation and certificate documents and hand them to VinFast free of charge.
- Donor vehicle performance data may suffice for carryover parts/systems.

Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability):
- Ensuring operational strength for vehicle-typical operational conditions is imperative.
- Verify product-specific characteristics derived from intended applications.
- Define specifications to ensure operational strength across the complete vehicle, subsystems, and components.
- The mounting force for components must be less than the dismounting force.

Operating loads:
- Operating loads arise through the regular use of a vehicle.
- Benchmarking using base models on tracks defined by VinFast determines these loads.
- The customer usage profile is derived from VinFast’s Mixed Circuit Europe (MCE) standard, covering durability testing.
- The tested mileage aligns with the vehicle's target mileage of 160,000 km.

<page number="15">
### Special events:
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.  

### Weight Management:
Because the vehicle weight has a significant influence on the energy consumption of the vehicle, the major goal of weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight.  
Throughout the whole development, attention must be paid to a weight-optimized design of all components. All weight reduction potentials have to be shown by the supplier, also with their impact on cost, timing, quality, etc.  
The whole system must not exceed a weight target of 2.5 kg.  

### Fuel Economy & Driving Performance:
n/a  

### Vehicle Dynamics & Fuel System Integration:
To enable sufficient brake cooling, the openings at the front bumper have to meet functional requirements as defined by Heat Management & Powertrain Cooling, Aerodynamics, and Chassis Module. The requirements have been aligned and checked in the Styling Technique Convergence meetings.  

### Vehicle Architecture:
#### Vehicle Architecture:
The complete vehicle must pass the requirements from the vehicle layout plans. All changes to parts and modules that affect the vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence of the vehicle must be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.  
The definition and technical geometric specification regarding complete vehicle dimensions in the interior and exterior are based on GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.  

#### Styling Technique Convergence:
All changes to parts and modules that affect the Exterior and/or Interior styling surfaces of the vehicle must be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.  
Part or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops have to be provided by the supplier, e.g., tooling demands, assembly sequence, based on defined requirements from VF module leads. Technical input can be provided, for example, as office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.

The complete vehicle must pass the following tests:
- Wading tests
- Splash tests
- Rain tests with different water flow rates and vehicle in tilted positions
- Wash tests with all possible kinds of washing methods, including high pressure
- Dust driving test
- Wet pollution test (vehicle on wet road behind lead vehicle)
- Icing test in wet conditions (vehicle cooled down in chamber to -20°C)

**Basic Requirements for Tightness** (based on complete vehicle tightness tests):
- No function-relevant leakage throughout the vehicle life.
- No water entrance into the cabin, also not by the HVAC system.
- Dust entrance, even with open windows, must not exceed a certain level as described in tightness requirements.
- Washability to customer satisfaction.

Material Requirements & Corrosion

Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is **not affected** by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

3. **High corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very high corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of critical material combinations, a proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).

Avoid water and dirt accumulation and always provide drainage in the lowest positions. Also, avoid dirt traps where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements.

Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.

Edge coverage must ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

3.7 Testing and Validation and DVP&R.

**Test Plan.**  
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in a good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the FSS SUP has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly or if new data/information due to development changes is needed. 

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of his component lies with the FSS SUP. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The FSS SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the FSS SUP site or their testing centers.

Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VinFast and FSS SUP. If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the costs of FSS SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting has to be paid for by FSS SUP if they are responsible for the failure.

**Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:**  
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirement.  
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing setup with pictures).  
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).  
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of a project plan).  
- Part variant, description of the part.
