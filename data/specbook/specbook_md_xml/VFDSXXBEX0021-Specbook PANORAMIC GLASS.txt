The FSS SUP holds full responsibility for the complete safeguarding of its component. Testing must be planned proactively to allow for approval and re-testing in the case of negative results. Any deviations from approved testing procedures need to be agreed upon by VinFast and FSS SUP.

Retesting due to incorrect parts or procedures must be at the cost of FSS SUP. Negative results also require retesting, which is paid for by FSS SUP if found responsible for the failure.

Data included in the DVP&R must consist of:
- Standard, norm, and legal requirement declarations.
- Detailed testing device descriptions with supporting pictures.
- Identification of the responsible test department.
- Details on testing location (internal/external).

FSS SUP must utilize the initial draft DVP&R provided by VF’s testing department. Preliminary data entry must occur no later than four weeks following SUP’s nomination. A DVP must be developed for each stage, including prototypes (if defined in the master timing chart) and serial production stages. The sequence and quantity of test specimens are determined collaboratively between FSS SUP, validation engineers, and VF component lead engineers.

FSS SUP must coordinate and gain approval of test plans from VinFast departments and review all DVP&R weekly. Any delays to the schedule require FSS SUP to propose measures for compliance. Upon request, a test plan is created for individual components.

Test Plan Example.
DVP updates must occur weekly, focusing on these supplier-provided points:
- Testing procedures.
- Set timelines and schedules.
- Device specifications for testing.

6 Supplier responsibilities.

Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier Responsibilities are itemised to help mitigate the risk to the organisation of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements.**

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall ensure life cycles of project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).

7 Intellectual Property / Copyright.

Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).  
If supplier is proposing his existing parts/component to be used in the assembly, it must be ensured that there will be no Intellectual Property infringement. Supplier must submit relevant documents/certificate in this regard. Supplier must notify VinFast if, at any stage, they believed there is a likelihood.
