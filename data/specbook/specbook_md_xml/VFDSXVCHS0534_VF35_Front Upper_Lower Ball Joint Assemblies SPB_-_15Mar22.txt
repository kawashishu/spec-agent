6 Supplier responsibilities.  
The supplier is responsible to provide or ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.  

**Customer service requirements:**  

- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
  The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

- **Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
  The support period of after-sales spare parts must ensure the life cycles of the project and the requirements in GTC after VINFAST end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.  

- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
  The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST’s after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes the BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearance, parts performance parameters).

11.1 In Process testing.

In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuing improvement. Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan. When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked.

The table below summarises the various IP tests and the acceptance parameters for each. They form the basis on which to develop a complete Control Plan for these and their related significant process characteristics. The Control Plan will include frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.

11.3 Dimensional Control.

The production supplier holds ultimate responsibility for writing the Control Plan and identifying significant characteristics (SC) in addition to the significant and critical (SC, CC/) features established by VinFast. It is also the responsibility of the production supplier to establish initial Process Control and ongoing process capability reporting that align with VinFast requirements. 

The Control Plan will identify features requiring process capability, which must be established using 30 randomly selected pieces from a continuous production run of no fewer than 300 pieces. The process capability data must adhere to AIAG PPAP Edition 4 and be included within the PPAP documentation.

If process capability is successfully demonstrated, X bar and R charts must be employed for ongoing control of the identified characteristics unless specifically waived by VinFast ATI1. Acceptance of parts by sampling plans or statistical process control procedures does not exempt the supplier from ensuring that each part meets all purchase order requirements and component specifications. Should any defects emerge during in-process sampling plan implementation, the supplier must initiate the reaction plan program detailed in the Control Plan.

VinFast ATI1 departmental requirements for process capability acceptability measures (e.g., Cp, Cpk) may supersede general guidelines at any time.

The supplier must also establish a documented fail-safe system, approved by VinFast, at all relevant facilities (forging, heat treating, machining, and final assembly). This system ensures that any non-compliant front knuckles are permanently removed from the production flow.

---

11.4 X-RAY Inspection for Porosity, Voids, & Cracks (Applicable only for Casting).

1. X-ray testing for internal discontinuities must be conducted post-casting according to the process control plan. During PV and IP-I stages, the supplier is responsible for devising specific acceptance standards for all critical areas susceptible to internal discontinuities (e.g., porosity, shrink, inclusions). These standards and identified locations must receive approval from VinFast ATI1, align with ASTM E155 & E505 references, and be included in production control plans.

2. Operators must undergo appropriate training to accurately interpret potential flaws using the specific equipment selected for production x-ray inspections. The training must comply with EN 473 (General principles for qualification and certification of NDT personnel) or ISO 9712 (Non-destructive testing - Qualification and certification of personnel). Records of this training must be maintained and made available for inspection by VinFast STA/ATI1.

3. Testing equipment must be capable of detecting discontinuities at or above ASTM E155 & E505 Plate 1 levels in identified critical areas. Either film-based or real-time x-ray systems may be used if their capability to resolve defects meets the standard requirements.

4. The x-ray inspection equipment must allow manual inspection for any areas deemed necessary. Automatic defect recognition systems may be implemented, provided they demonstrate equivalent or superior efficacy compared to a trained inspector during the ‘run at rate’ trial for the relevant component.

11.5 Fluorescent Dye Penetrant for Surface Defects (Casting/Forging) (crack check).

1. A fluorescent dye penetrant test for cracks and surface discontinuities will be performed on all exterior part surfaces, per ASTM E165 (method A) and ASTM E433.

2. Operators must receive appropriate training in interpreting potential flaws with the particular equipment chosen for the production dye penetrant inspection procedures in accordance with EN 473 (General principles for qualification and certification of NDT personnel) or ISO 9712 (Non-destructive testing - Qualification and certification of personnel). Evidence of this training shall be held on file for inspection by Vinfast STA / ATI1.

3. Specified defects may be checked for severity by grinding removal if the following conditions are met:
   a) The removal method must be proven not to mask the defect to the fluorescent dye penetrant detection.
   b) The depth of removal must not create any stress raisers or thin out any wall thickness below the as-cast print specified minimum. The surface finishes after any material removal must be fine enough such that no notches are created which could initiate fatigue cracks (this is defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1mm and/or root radius less than or equal to 5mm).
   c) The depth of removal must not violate the part print tolerances.

4. If any defects in excess of the maximum allowable values and/or acceptance standards are found, refer to the reaction plan within the Process Control Plan.

5. All parts inspected during IP-II phase must be shown to be free from defects for a period of 90 days in order that this requirement is revoked. Otherwise, dye penetrant inspection shall continue until ATI1 / STA is satisfied that this process is no longer necessary.

11.6 Feature Removal Standards & Surface Finish (Castings/Forging).

1. The maximum allowable flash will be no greater than 0.5 mm; a chamfer allowance of 2 mm (max) is acceptable to accommodate this requirement. The use of controlled grinding operations on the part is approved for flash and sharp edge removal in order to ensure safe part handling. In any areas where flash or other defects are removed, the minimum wall thickness detailed on the part model must be maintained. In addition, the surface finish after any material removal must be fine enough so that no notches are present which could initiate fatigue cracks (this is defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1mm and/or a root radius less than or equal to 5mm). In general, the removal of any material from a part must not compromise the part function.

As-cast surface roughness shall be less than or equal to cast surface Rz < 50, web & fettled areas Rz < 50. Equivalent specification to be followed for forged surfaces.

11.8 Mechanical Properties (Casting/Forging)

1. The mechanical properties shall be checked per ASTM B108 and B557 procedures or applicable ASTM standards for forgings.

2. For batch furnace heat treat lots, two (2) test bars from each three (3) pairs (12 in total) of components per heat treat lot (after heat treat operation) shall be taken from identified areas from the component (FIGURE 11.4). These bars are to be checked as a minimum requirement. Once sufficient data proves adequately reproducible mechanical properties throughout the heat treat lot, and with Vinfast ATI1/STA agreement, the sampling size will be reduced to two (2) test bars from one (1) pair (4 in total) per heat treat lot.

3. All tensile bar sizes and types should conform to BS-EN 10002-1. Testing is required to be performed with 6mm gauge diameter test specimens. All other sample dimensions must adhere to the BS-EN standard.

4. In addition to meeting all ASTM B108 requirements, the following individual strength criteria must be met in the tensile specimens designated in Sections M. 2: 
   - Minimum Tensile Strength (MPa): REFER TO 3.4 MATERIAL REQUIREMENT
   - Minimum Yield Strength (MPa): REFER TO 3.4 MATERIAL REQUIREMENT
   - Minimum Elongation: REFER TO 3.4 MATERIAL REQUIREMENT

5. If minimum requirements are not met, refer to the reaction plan contained within the Vinfast Product Development approved Control Plan.
