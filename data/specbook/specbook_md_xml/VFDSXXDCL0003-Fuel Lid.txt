#### 3.2 Technical Requirement
- The supplier shall assemble all levels of parts in the assembly before the parts are sent to VINFAST.
- During assembly, the function and appearance of each part shall not be damaged to ensure that the part size is correct (no deformation, distortion, etc.).
- If the supplier needs to find sub-suppliers, the sub-suppliers must be approved by VINFAST.
- The supplier must complete all molds, manufacturing, and assembly fixtures and other work in the contract within the signing time. The contract must meet and comply with the relevant procedures and laws and regulations. This clause also applies to secondary suppliers.
