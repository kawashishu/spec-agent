Requirements: 
During the stiffness- and rigidity testing there must not be any permanent deformations.

<page number="22">
### Most Important Functions of Cockpit:
- Optical trim.
- Absorption of noises.
- Absorbing properties in case of head-impact.
- Integration of add-on parts.
- Must fulfill all functions over its lifetime.

### Crosscarbeam IP:
- The cross car beam (CCB) should be used as the main fixation of the IP.
- The master reference point is between the IP main carrier and CCB in Y=0.
- Input regarding fixation and stiffness is defined by SDS IP.
- Technical CCB specifications are detailed in the spec book for the CCB.

### Airbag Door Requirements:
The airbag door must include an invisible breakup solution. The following points outline the requirements:
- The lid carrier should be horizontally divided, ideally symmetrically.
- If a supplier proposes a different solution, they must present and discuss the concept with VinFast.
- The split line must remain invisible on the dashboard skin (A-surface).
- Hinge lines must not leave visible marks on the skin.
- All break lines of the airbag door must remain hidden and can be achieved using:
  - Cold knife cutting.
  - Laser cutting.
- Testing temperatures include room temperature (+20°C), low temperature (-30°C), and high temperature (+85°C) with tolerance ±2.5°C. All generator loads, including Minimum, Nominal, and Maximum loads, should be accounted for.
- VinFast suggests adding an airbag shooting channel to the backside of the IP via vibration welding, ultrasonic welding, or infrared welding. Injection-molded dashboards with integrated shooting channels are also acceptable if no split lines are visible.

The airbag door must:
- Have no separate door for the passenger airbag.
- Be integrated and firmly attached to the dashboard to prevent detachment.
- Ensure there is no injury risk caused by the instrument panel or airbag door during or after deployment (e.g., primary or secondary collision).

### Opening Force:
- The opening force of the airbag door must be finalized in agreement with the airbag supplier.
- The force must be specified in the production drawing and should not exceed 2.3 kN.
- Refer to the safety and restraint system specification for the complete testing program. The appendix in the subsystem technical specification contains the validation program for all development phases.

### Foam Separation Airbag Deployment:
Criteria for part separation are assessed under the following categories:
- **Ok**: All requirements are met.
- **Ok rq**: Report is required.
- **Nok**: Requirements are not met.

breakage and no customer relevant modifications.

Most important function of Cockpit:
- Optical trim
- Absorption of noises
- Absorbing properties in case of head-impact
- Integration of add-on parts
- Has to fulfill all functions over the lifetime

Crosscarbeam IP:
- The cross car beam (CCB) should be used as the main fixation of the IP.
- Master Reference Point between IP main carrier and CCB is Y=0.
- Input about the kind of fixation and stiffness is defined from SDS IP.
- Technical CCB specifications are defined in the spec book CCB.

Airbag door:
The airbag door contains an invisible breakup solution. Therefore, the lid carrier is horizontally divided, if possible symmetrical. If the supplier has the opinion that another airbag door solution fulfills the requirements in a better way, the supplier has the responsibility to inform, present, and discuss the concept with VinFast. The split line must be invisible on the dashboard skin (A-surface). The hinge lines must not show marks on the skin. All break lines of the airbag door are invisible; they can be made by cutting with a cold knife or by a laser. The airbag door must be tested at all temperatures, which include room temperature (+20°C), low temperature (-30°C), high temperature (+85°C), and all generator loads (Minimum/Nominal/Maximum load). The tolerance for all testing temperatures is ±2.5°C.

VinFast proposes to bring in an airbag shooting channel on the backside of the IP, which could be vibration welded, ultrasonic welded, or infrared welded. If the supplier has the know-how to develop an injection-molded dashboard with an integrated shooting channel, this solution is also acceptable if no split line is visible on the A-surface of the dashboard and all other requirements mentioned in this technical specification can be fulfilled.

The development target is to have no separate door for the passenger airbag. The integrated airbag door must be firmly attached to the dashboard to avoid any risk of tearing off.

Specific demands:  
- According to protocols: Pendulum impact UN-R21 relevant in case of getting impact points from Art. 8 homologation procedure.  
- Optimization of knee area stiffness.  
- Force vs. deformation; targets will be defined by VinFast.  
- Robustness and homogeneity for knee impact stiffness, including a 20mm motion margin.  
- No knee modifiers for NCAP’s. If knee mapping procedures seem necessary, the supplier must plan and perform actions for it, including sled CAE/testing and related costs.  
- Analysis must consider relevant parts, e.g., steering system, knee airbags, glove box, radio, etc.  

Deployment of passenger front airbag:  
- Deployment on system level.  
- Integration of airbag CAE model into cockpit CAE model.  
- Deployment versus interior, windscreen, relevant passengers; including cockpit cover and/or tear seam.  

General demands:  
- Vehicle safety functions must be maximally prepared by system-level expertise, CAE, and testing.  
- Project-relevant supplier data must be handed over to VinFast on request and free of charge. VinFast is allowed to forward this data to other parties within the project.  
- Target fulfillment of performances with spread effects must be secured by an adequate number of worst results from identical test series.  
- Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand, e.g., to support and reach vehicle data freeze milestones. These must be realized within LsDyna, validated, numerical, and physically stable.  
- FE meshes must be homogeneous, aligned to part axes/geometry, with a density of 8-10mm. Non-compliance with meshing guidelines requires re-work.  
- For generating validated CAE material cards, activities must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier, including principle tests and component evaluations.  
- Supplier test matrices must meet full vehicle timing demands. Prior optimization test series must be completed before scaled tests like sled or vehicle crash tests.  
- Supplier-specific parts for testing at any project facility must be provided free of charge. Testing-related supplier costs must be accounted for.  
- Integration of requests from full vehicle crash optimization processes at VinFast must be accepted without additional costs, including material definitions, material thicknesses, optimization work, and added parts.

Functional Responsibility  

This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  
Recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental expert’s team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

### Material Requirements & Corrosion  

#### Corrosion Requirements Interior:  
- Screws, bolts on Handles, mirror  
- Key  
- Seat belts  
- Trunk area  
- Seat structure  
- Invisible structural parts  
- Vehicle tooling  

#### Generally:  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

#### Corrosion Tests:  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

#### Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:  
- **Fog test:** ISO6270 CH; acceptance criteria see below  
- **Salt spray test:** ISO9227; acceptance criteria see below  

#### For Organic Coatings:  
- **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B; acceptance criteria see below
</page>

<page number="42">
Alternative tests possible, if proposed by supplier and accepted by corrosion engineer.

Test criteria:

| Area                                | Corrosivity    | Metallic coatings                   | Organic coatings                        | Pass criteria                         |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area  | Low           | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227                | 96 h → ISO6270 CH                       | No red rust                           |
| Exterior                            | Medium        | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227                | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B          | NSS: No red rust / CCT: See below     |
| High & not visible for customer;   | High & visible| 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227            | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B         | NSS: No red rust / CCT: See below     |

Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:
- **Rust creep**:  
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.  
- **Blistering**:  
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  
- **Edge corrosion**: ≤ 10%.  
- **Weld seam corrosion**: ≤ 5%.  
- **Degree of rusting**: ≤ Ri 1 (according ISO4628-3).

The interior is basically considered as a dry area, meaning an area with low corrosivity. Exceptions might be the floor area or areas where wetness/abrasion by shoes or drinking juices could produce corrosion.

For combining different metals, galvanic corrosion should be avoided by appropriate coating of such parts. Edges, especially painted edges, must be burr-free for good edge coverage and to avoid wear.

The seat structure, if uncoated (blank steel), requires new parts to be corrosion-free. Additionally, areas with corrosion risk must not be visible to the customer. Extreme positions of the seat-rests must also be considered.

In other invisible areas, lower test criteria than those mentioned above can be allowed, but it must be ensured that no corrosive products appear in visible areas, and lifetime functionality of the parts must be guaranteed.

Vehicle tooling, which is usually stored in the trunk, is considered to have low corrosivity exposure. For tool surfaces subject to wear, the corrosivity might be categorized as medium.

**Test Plan**

The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding test engineer of VinFast.

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of his component lies with the SDS. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The SDS has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast and SDS.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the expense of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting has to be paid by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

**Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:**
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible to use the draft DVP&R provided by VinFast testing department. The initial data filling has to be done by the SDS and submitted to VinFast (at least 4 weeks after the nomination of the SDS).

The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

**Principles:**
The sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. 

The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department VinFast SQA and SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS will draw up a test plan for each single component.
</page>

<page number="44">
# Testing

## General
The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.17). It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.

To prevent double testing, mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS must be stated in the SDS quotation and ordered from VinFast by the SDS.

Unless expressly agreed otherwise, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery, and parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department must be provided by the SDS free of charge.

The SDS must assure compliance with all relevant legislations concerning its component and ensure fulfillment of all internal VFDST requirements as stated in the performance specification.

All test results shall be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VinFast. All relevant Vietnamese legal obligations must be fulfilled.

Tests must be documented per VF standard or alternatively SDS standard, if accepted by VinFast. The SDS evaluates and performs the tests for the serial development phase in line with equipment specifications. Tests must also be presented within the attached DVP&R template as part of the offer.

Samples for inspections must be provided in a timely manner or no later than the agreed date coordinated with the test department. Even manual samples may suffice in certain cases to introduce fixes for assembly issues early enough to ensure the installability of test parts.

VINFAST Logistics determines the number of sample parts, while VINFAST Purchase oversees ordering these parts. Positive disassembly and inspection reports of the latest build level must accompany all required test reports as per DVP&R.

### Additional Requirements
- CAD data models in compliance with VinFast requirements must be supplied in time for virtual sample manufacturing.
- Sample parts must be marked according to VF Standard VFDST00008700.
- Measurement reports prepared per VF Standard VFDST00008900.
- Reference point systems established per VF Standard VFDST00000011.

## Release by Test Departments
The responsible VinFast test department will approve the components only if test targets have been completely achieved by the SDS during tests conducted under complete vehicle integration.

- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00008500) [36].

Basically no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range is allowed. In particular, by the use of materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients, the behavior has to be kept.

The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.

These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VinFast and the SDS, and will be binding.

If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.

Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department, have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

General.

See General Engineering Requirements for Suppliers.

RPS (reference position system): The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. An RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS-system and VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28] according interior- and BIW-department.

Tolerance analyses:
</page>

<page number="48">
Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms.
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.

### Interfaces
The components must be designed such that the function is guaranteed in combination with the adjoining systems. The interfaces must be worked out in cooperation with VinFast in consideration of a quality method (e.g., FMEA, risk filter).
