### Performance Specification

#### NVH and Driving Comfort  

**General: Complete Vehicle NVH and Driving Comfort Targets**  
The vehicle shall enable an acoustics and vibration comfort which is well-balanced with vehicle dynamics and drivability so that long-distance driving comfort, as well as driving over rough roads, is neither exhausting nor annoying. This requires the absolute absence of squeak and rattle issues under all load cases (speed, maneuver, temperature, etc.).  

---

**Supplier Responsibility.**
</page>

<page number="16">
The validation of NVH and driving comfort will be done on complete vehicle level and comprises real customer operation conditions. Before the validation on complete vehicle level takes place, the supplier has to assure the readiness of the components and the system for durability and general testing. The evidence for the test maturity of the components has to be reported in the DVP&R (Design, Verification and Development Report) at the component level.

System suppliers are requested to perform validation activities as specified in respective technical specifications. All parts required for validation activities are specified by DVP&R and must meet the required maturity level. VINFAST will define quality criteria and validation methods for alignment with suppliers. In general, it is mandatory for the supplier to support the NVH development process and the complete product cycle as well. The support requires cooperation with the development team and manufacturing, especially for root cause investigations. The supplier must consider and support the achievement of complete vehicle NVH targets (objective and subjective targets) at the component and system levels.

All components must be free of squeak and rattle noises to avoid psychoacoustic annoyance during all operation conditions of the vehicle, including audio acoustic excitation. The robustness of design has to be assured and reported virtually and in the hardware phase before serial release. The sound of actuation noises must not be audible, representing a high-quality impression integrated into the complete vehicle. The requirements must be performed under all specified environmental and thermal conditions.

During serial manufacturing, a capable quality assurance process must be established to ensure the quality level. The supplier must provide components for testing and NVH tuning and ensure the participation of specialists during local testing and troubleshooting processes.

### Vehicle Safety

#### Cooperation with VINFAST vehicle safety department
The supplier must support the integration of vehicle safety functions actively. Lifetime relevant laws and ratings from selling markets, as well as OEM requirements, must be considered.

#### Specific demands
- **Geometrical targets**
  - Distance to seat in side bag deployment relevant area: ≥ 65 mm.
  - Shape homogeneity with respect to several dummy regions.

- **Additional sub targets will be defined by VINFAST**
  - Resistance at several trim areas; unless further definition is provided, donor vehicle stiffness must be aspired.
  - As a validation base and optimization approach, donor vehicle parts must also be tested.
  - Without claiming completeness, VINFAST assumes a minimum of 30 tests on donor vehicle door trims and project-specific PT parts at least two months before PR release.
</page>

<page number="17">
General demands  
Unless further specific definitions are given, the supplier is required to consider the following points:  

- Vehicle safety functions must be maximally prepared at the system level using expertise, CAE, and testing.  
- Project-relevant supplier data must be handed over to VINFAST upon request and free of charge. VINFAST may share this data with other parties within the project.  
- Target performance fulfillment with spread effects must be secured by testing adequate numbers of worst results from identical test series.  
- Part/system CAE models must be provided upon demand to support and achieve vehicle data freeze milestones. These models must be created using LsDyna and validated as both numerically and physically stable.  
- FE meshes must maintain homogeneity corresponding to part axes/geometry, with a mesh density of 8–10 mm. Non-compliance with meshing guidelines requires reworking.  
- Suppliers must plan, perform, and finance activities for generating validated CAE material cards, including principle tests on systems and components.  
- Supplier test matrices must align with full vehicle timing demands. Component-level optimization tests must precede higher-tier tests (e.g., sled or vehicle crash tests).  
- Supplier-specific parts required for testing at any stage of the project must be provided free of charge to relevant testing facilities. If physical parts or CAE models are required by the supplier, costs must be borne by the supplier.  
- Requests arising from VINFAST's full vehicle crash optimization process must be integrated without additional costs. Examples include material definitions, material thickness changes, additional parts, and optimization efforts.  

**General Requirements:**  
  - A mandatory 20% safety margin must be applied to each single target value.  
  - The integrity of occupant survival areas must account for part behavior and fluids, encompassing all parts in direct and indirect contact with passengers.  
  - No edges below 3.2 mm are allowed during or post-impact.  
  - Electrical system integrity must remain uncompromised during impact and for post-crash functions.  
  - Relevant tolerances must be properly considered.  
  - Robust achievement of targets must be ensured.  
  - Asymmetries must undergo investigation on all sides until VINFAST confirms a reliable worst-case scenario.  
  - No modifications will be permitted for any rating.  

**Additional Specific Demands:**  
  - Listed without claim to completeness.
</page>

<page number="18">
### General Demands

- Any tracking actions of concerned parties for observed issues must be done; e.g., to get parts/data/CAE models/information from further suppliers.
- Any devices, as test bucks/sleds/etc., must be set up by the supplier, based on unfinished parts; e.g., a non-prepared BIW to be used finally as a sled.
- For targets totally or partly fulfilled on system level, the supplier has to prepare homologation and/or certificate documents. Data has to be handed over to VINFAST free of charge.
- In case of carry-over parts/systems, fulfillment of system requirements can be shown by donor vehicle performance data.

---

### Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability)

#### Additional Requirements:  
The component has to meet all requirements according to VinFast Standard TS VEHICLE DOOR VFDST00014600 [4] unless there is another target or standard stated in this specification.

---

### Weight Management

Because the vehicle weight has a big influence on the energy consumption of the vehicle, the major goal of the weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight:  
- Throughout the development, attention must be paid to a weight-optimized design of all components.  
- All weight reduction potentials have to be disclosed by the supplier, along with their impact on cost, timing, quality, etc.

#### Target Specifications:
- The whole system must not exceed a weight target of **x.xxkg**.

#### Additional Requirements to the Target Weights:  
| Module                        | Weight Target |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| ASM C CUV Front Door Trim (x2) | 4.2 kg (x2)   |

**Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:**
To ensure a cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function shall be provided via the diagnosis or central data interface for pyrotechnical components. This function must comply with the following requirements:
- Enable sequential deployment of all components avoiding noise and pressure peaks, and provide checks for deployment per component.
- Ensure that no solid combustion residues remain post-deployment, which could be classified as toxic waste or hazardous substances. If solid residues remain, components must be dismantled and disposed of separately.
- Achieve immediate and clear visibility of the successful deployment, either acoustically, directly at the vehicle, or via feedback from the deployment tool.
- Mark the positions of pyrotechnical components (e.g., hidden components like battery safety terminal clamps, active safety headrests).
- In cases of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components must be feasible without the need for pre-dismantling, ensuring easy accessibility of fasteners.

**Recycling:**
*Recycled Materials:*  
When selecting materials, focus on reducing material variety and compatibility with available recycling procedures (proven recycling technologies). Secondary raw materials, including recycled polymeric PET fiber, textiles, foams, thermoplastics, etc., are preferred if market availability allows. Recycled materials need to be marked according to standards outlined in this specification book and reported to the VINFAST environmental compliance expert team.

### Generally:
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very high corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.
</page>

<page number="29">
Corrosion Tests:
The parts must pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:
- **Fog Test:** ISO6270 CH, acceptance criteria defined below.
- **Salt Spray Test:** ISO9227, acceptance criteria defined below.

For Organic Coatings:
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria defined below.  
- Alternative tests can be proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test Criteria:

| **Area**                  | **Corrosivity**              | **Metallic Coatings**              | **Organic Coatings**              | **Pass Criteria**                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                          | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227              | 96 h → ISO6270 CH                  | No red rust                                      |
| Exterior                  | Medium                       | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227              | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B     | NSS: No red rust<br>CCT: See below              |
| High & not visible for customer / High & visible | High                          | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227          | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B   | NSS: No red rust<br>CCT: See below              |

### Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT:
- **Rust Creep:**
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1–2 mm.
  
- **Blistering:**
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).

- **Edge Corrosion:**
  - ≤ 10%.

- **Weld Seam Corrosion:**
  - ≤ 5%.

- **Degree of Rusting:**
  - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

### Additional Notes:
- The interior is generally considered a dry area with low corrosivity. Exceptions include floor areas or areas subject to wetness or abrasion (e.g., by shoes or spilled juices), which could cause corrosion.
- To avoid galvanic corrosion, coating is recommended when combining different metals.
</page>

<page number="30">
Edges, especially painted edges, shall be burr-free for good edge coverage and avoiding wear. Seat structure, uncoated (blank steel): At least new parts must be corrosion-free, further the areas with corrosion risk must not be visible for the customer. Consider extreme positions of the seat-rests. On other invisible areas the test criteria may also be lower than above mentioned, but it must be ensured that no corrosive products appear in visible areas, and further the full function over lifetime must be assured.

Vehicle tooling: Usually stored in trunk, considered to low corrosivity exposure; for tool surfaces with wear, the corrosivity might be medium.

Corrosion requirements on Electric components.

### Test Plan
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VINFAST wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST.

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly during the testing phase, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for complete safeguarding of the component lies with the SDS. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The SDS has to ensure that VINFAST gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VINFAST can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed between VINFAST and SDS.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts or different testing procedure, the testing has to be redone at the cost of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned, and the re-testing has to be paid by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

### Data to be Included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
