It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification are to be agreed between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:
- The sound deadener specific requirements.
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of selling markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.

For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time schedule.

The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of selling markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class D and C common platform. VINFAST shall also monitor ongoing changes to rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.

The supplier delivers the sound deadener as a module (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated).

For the documentation of the release, the following sheets and documents are necessary:
- Drawings.
- Quality regulations: Laboratory Test Report Measurement of Loss factor, Young modulus, peel-off force test, etc., to prove the product’s performance as VFDST00031707.
- Results/documentation of test validation.
- Documentation of the DFMEA.

All parts of the assembly must be matched to each other.

Functional dimensions must be fulfilled according to the prescription.

The supplier must ensure that the developed parts comply with PRC regulations and VINFAST specifications, obtain component type approval, and submit all necessary documents to support vehicle type approval.
</page>

<page number="10">
Upon completion of the synchronous development, the supplier shall provide the necessary documentation to prove that its products have met the promised regulatory requirements.

The parts shall be in accordance not only with the drawings and specifications listed here, but also with any additional requirements on the SOR. Any items in the drawings, specifications and SOR may be changed in the future, and the parts shall be in accordance with the changed requirements.

### Technical requirements
Sound deadener detailed technical requirements are specified in VINFAST standard VFDST00031707, titled "Damping pad - Requirements and tests." When not explicitly mentioned in this specification or found to be contrary to this article, the provisions of VINFAST standard shall apply.

### Parts schematic drawing and appearance outline size
Figures provided below are for reference and serve only as a basis for quotation.

**FIG. 2 Front Door Damping Pads (Upper and Lower)**
- **Damping pad Front Door LH/RH Upper**:
  - Dimensions: Length = 400 mm, Height = 8 mm, Width = 150 mm.
  - Thickness = 2 mm.
- **Damping pad Front Door LH/RH Lower**:
  - Dimensions: Length = 650 mm, Height = 240 mm, Width = 150 mm.
  - Thickness = 2 mm.

The diagrams illustrate the dimensions and physical layout of damping pads for front doors, upper and lower sections on LH/RH configurations. These components must adhere to specified thickness and dimensional standards for sound deadening functionality. Future adjustments may occur based on development needs.
