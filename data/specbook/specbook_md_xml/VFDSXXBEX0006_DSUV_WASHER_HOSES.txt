#### Material Requirements for Corrosion Resistance  

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.  

- **Material Selection:**  
  - Material combinations must prevent galvanic corrosion.  
  - Critical material combinations require proper coatings (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  

- **Design Considerations:**  
  - Avoid accumulation of water and dirt; always provide drainage at the lowest positions.  
  - Prevent dirt traps where sand or other debris may act as abrasives, causing potential damage to painted surfaces.  
  - Ensure contact surfaces are dry, sufficient in size for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive materials. Micro-movements should be minimized.  

- **Edge Protection:**  
  - Ensure burr-free edges and implement paint systems that offer good edge coverage.

   - Choose corrosion-resistant materials for long-term compatibility.
</page>

<page number="14">
The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion. Terminals and connectors must not be placed at the lowest points. Corrosion protection for terminals primarily depends on tightness, requiring electrical connections to be protected from humidity. Grounding surfaces must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.

Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content greater than 1% are highly sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Corrosion may quickly penetrate seals, creating openings for moisture infiltration.

**Prevention of stone chipping issues:**
- Shielding parts should be provided for easily damageable vehicle components.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can prevent severe damage.
- Part materials and paint should be selected with colors that minimize visible abrasion in areas prone to stone hitting.
- Parts with edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction must be avoided.
- Chromed styling elements in lower vehicle areas should be recessed to minimize damage by stones.

The system supplier is responsible for defining and confirming materials. All assemblies and components must be developed for economical recycling at the end-of-life of the vehicle. Recycling concepts are mandatory, and only approved materials from the European automotive industry are permissible.

**Material and production requirements:**
- Components must be designed to prevent production-related surface defects, including tool parting points, flow marks, and stress zones.
- Material-compliant features such as fits, curvatures, and corners must ensure visually parallel and offset-free alignments of joints.
- Component edges, corners, and ribs must adhere to accurate proportions and material-compliant designs.
- Homogeneous grain structures must be ensured through suitable production methods.
- Visible screw points and dummy covers must be avoided.
- Burr-free surfaces in visual and haptic zones are mandatory.
- Grilles, covers, indentations, joints, and cavities must provide a tidy overall impression, preventing visibility of other components.
</page>

<page number="15">
Ensuring correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts.

- Ensuring components are free of disturbing noise in contact with the environment across all temperatures and driving conditions.
- Surfaces have to be designed according to DIN EN ISO 1302 standards.
- Suppliers must meet quality requirements from production materials following "VFDST00055300."
- Coordination of form and surface requires corresponding samples, including Cubing reports and Appearance Approval reports (VFDST00038400 Color Matching/Appearance Approval and VDA 280 part 1). These are presented to VinFast approval offices.
- Materials matching parts have to be available from suppliers following timelines from the color and trim department.

#### Subjective Sound Requirements:
- No judder or squeak audible in any condition.
- The relay noise during interval mode should not be audible in idle conditions.
- The reversal thumb sound of the wiper blades should occur as a singular audible event.
</page>

<page number="16">
Objective Sound Requirement:
The 10% percentile of the A-weighted level corresponds well to the maximum peaks of the wiper sound during the reversal thump impulse. The 10% percentile of the A-weighted level must not exceed 55dB(A) for interval mode and stage 1 and 58dB(A) for the highest stage. The 50% percentile of the A-weighted level corresponds well to the motor noise in between the reversal thumps. The 50% percentile of the A-weighted level must not exceed 45dB(A) for interval mode and stage 1, and 48dB(A) for the highest stage. The specific prominence ratio of the sound corresponds well to the whine contribution within the sound.
