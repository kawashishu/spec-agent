**3.2.2.2 Component Functions**

**Mirror glass**  
The mirror glass is responsible for reflecting the rear field of view. It must meet legal field of view requirements for the intended market of sale. The US driver side glass uses unit magnification, while all other glasses use spherical convex, with a radius ranging from a minimum of 1200 mm to a maximum of 1300 mm.

**Mirror glass heating**  
Mirror glass heating prevents the reflecting surface from frosting or accumulating humidity to ensure clear visibility within the legally required field of view. Heated glass identification markings are required.

**Power Adjustment**  
The power adjustment function enables drivers to rotate the reflecting surface around a virtual point. This provides the capability to adjust the horizontal and vertical field of view by a minimum of +/- 8 degrees on each side.

**Reverse Link**  
Reverse Link is activated only when the vehicle is in reverse drive direction. Upon activation, the glass adjustment device moves the reflecting surface to enhance the visibility of nearby elements during parking. After deactivating this function, the mirror glass position reverts to its previous values.

**Memory**  
The mirror glass is capable of recalling and adjusting itself to predefined saved positions for multiple drivers.

**Side turn indicator**  
The side turn indicator serves as an additional signaling mechanism for the vehicle's driving direction. It is integrated into the mirror head and consists of a light bar with at least two LEDs. This feature complies with applicable ECE & FMVSS regulations.

**Power folding**  
Power folding allows the rotation of the mirror head around a defined axis relative to the mirror foot or base, which is fixed to the car body. The folding unit also permits manual folding.

**Surround Camera**  
The integrated camera is a component of the system responsible for creating a 360-degree surround view of the vehicle's surroundings. The camera lens is positioned with a cutout on the lower side of the lower housing.

**Temperature sensor**  
An integrated temperature sensor enables continuous measurement of the external temperature. The temperature sensor is installed exclusively on the driver side with a sensing range between -30˚C and 85˚C.

**Auto Dimming**  
The auto-dimming function automatically adjusts and clears the mirror glass according to ambient and incident light levels, thereby reducing glare. The auto-dimming control is powered by VinFast's existing inner mirror (IRVM), which outputs a 49Hz PWM signal ranging from 1.1V to 1.4V and a variable duty cycle of 0% to 100%. The supplier must provide any required additional control units to ensure functionality. Variable levels of dimming should be achievable.

3.2.2.2 Component Functions.

**Mirror glass.**  
Reflects the rear field of view and meets legal field of view requirements for the intended market of sale. In the United States, driver-side glass is unit magnification, while all other glasses are spherical convex with a radius ranging from a minimum of 1200 mm to a maximum of 1300 mm.  

**Mirror glass heating.**  
The heating functionality prevents the reflecting surface from frosting or humidity, ensuring clear visibility within the legally required field of view. Heated glass must be identified by a visible mark.  

**Power Adjustment.**  
This function enables the driver to rotate the reflecting surface around a virtual point, allowing movement of the field of view horizontally and vertically by a minimum of +/- 8 degrees in each direction.  

**Reverse Link.**  
Activated only during reverse driving, this functionality enhances parking visibility by moving the mirror glass to predefined positions. Upon deactivation, the mirror glass must return to its previous settings.  

**Memory.**  
The mirror glass must be capable of recalling and adjusting to predefined saved positions for multiple drivers.  

**Side Turn Indicator.**  
Integrated within the mirror head, the side turn indicator serves as an additional signal for driving direction. It includes a light bar with a minimum of 2 LEDs and complies with applicable ECE and FMVSS regulations.  

**Power Folding.**  
Enables rotation of the mirror head around a defined axis relative to the mirror base that is fixed to the vehicle body. Manual folding must also be permitted by the folding unit.  

**Surround Camera.**  
The integrated camera contributes to the vehicle’s 360° surround view system. A cutout for the camera lens must be positioned on the lower side of the lower housing.  

**Temperature Sensor.**  
The driver-side mirror includes a temperature sensor capable of measuring external temperatures ranging from -30°C to 85°C continuously.  

**Auto Dimming.**  
This feature reduces glare by automatically dimming and clearing the mirror glass based on ambient and incident light levels. Control is facilitated via the inner rearview mirror (IRVM) using a 1.1-1.4V, 49Hz PWM signal with variable duty cycles from 0% to 100%. Additional control units, as needed, are the supplier's responsibility, and variable dimming levels must be supported.

3.2.2.3 Interfaces.

The components must function seamlessly with adjoining systems and interfaces. The concept will be defined collaboratively during the engineering phase between the supplier and VinFast.  

- The supplier will develop and refine the fixation and functionality of the outer mirror system based on provided input while also integrating additional required assembly elements.  
- All interfaces must undergo quality assurance processes, such as FMEA.  
- Measures must be taken to prevent contact corrosion when diverse materials are used.  
- Proper fitting of the parts must be ensured, even under unfavorable tolerance conditions.  

Relevant module interfaces include:  
- BIW side panels.  
- Door structure.  
- Door sealing system.  
- Front side window.  
- Door harness.

**3.3 NVH & Driving Comfort.**  

**General:**  
VinFast's target system for the outer rearview mirror is oriented toward reference vehicles. Gas and water tightness contribute to acoustical tightness, which must be adequately achieved.
</page>

<page number="16">
3.3 NVH & Driving Comfort

The system must not cause any kind of disturbing sound (relative movement, wind noise, squeak and rattle, temperature, flexural torsion, etc.) during any operation. All possible appropriate measures must be taken to prevent operating noises (e.g., wind noise and whining noise) completely or absorb/deaden them to the greatest extent possible to achieve acceptable noises.

Squeak and rattle (S&R) effects, which may occur during high-speed driving of the vehicle, particularly at certain humidity levels, must be avoided by means of a suitable profile design and by choosing the right surface coating process of an appropriately high-quality material pairing (material matching) that offers adequate durability. The NVH team may assist in selecting the material pairing due to buzzing, squeak, and rattle noise generation.

All components of the seal system are to be designed with respect to the reduction of aerodynamic resistance and optimum aero-acoustic characteristics. To ensure the disturbing noise freedom, the requirements must be coordinated with the responsible NVH-testing team.

**Natural frequency**:  
To achieve subjective targets of low vibration at maximum speed, the target for the first eigenfrequency of the mirror assembly should be higher than 60Hz—measured on the trimmed body.

The supplier must guarantee:
- No amplification of wind noise and vibrations on outer mirrors.
- Avoiding noise caused by the function of components or by joints due to unfavorable tolerances.
- No whistling, buzzing, squeaking, and rattling noises during high-speed driving.
- All functions must be fulfilled under all operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).

### 3. Material Requirement for Corrosion Resistance

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low**:  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium**:  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

3. **High Corrosivity**:  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very High Corrosivity**:  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

#### General Considerations
- The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.
- Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. For critical material combinations, proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).
- Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in lowest positions.
- Avoid dirt traps where sand can act as an abrasive, damaging the painted body by micro-movements.
- Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material to minimize micro-movement.
- Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

#### Corrosion Tests
The parts must pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

##### Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:
- **Salt spray test**: ISO9227; acceptance criteria as described below.

##### For Organic Coatings:
- **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT)**: ISO11997 Cycle B; acceptance criteria as described below.

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

#### Test Criteria:
| **Area**                         | **Corrosivity** | **Metallic Coatings**              | **Organic Coatings**       | **Pass Criteria**          |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Interior, mounted parts, dry area** | Low             | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227               | 96 h → ISO6270 CH          | No red rust               |
| **Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, wet area** | Medium          | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227               | 5 cycles CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust          |
| **Exterior, high corrosivity (not visible for customer)** | High            | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227               | 10 cycles CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | CCT: See below            |
</page>

<page number="18">
High/visible, very high corrosivity areas require 720 hours NSS testing according to ISO 9227 standards and 10 cycles of CCT (ISO 11997 Cycle B), with added stone chipping protection where needed.

### Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings after CCT:
- **Rust creep** (ISO 4628-8):
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1–2 mm.
- **Blistering**: Blister size max. S2 (DIN EN ISO 4628-2).
- **Edge corrosion**: ≤ 10%.
- **Weld seam corrosion**: ≤ 5%.
- **Degree of rusting**: ≤ Ri 1 (ISO 4628-3).

**Stainless Steel Requirements:**
- Avoid direct contact with other metals (to prevent galvanic corrosion); most cases require insulating coating.
- Test criteria for high visible parts: 720 hours NSS according to ISO 9227 without surface change. Special checks for crevices.
- Execute component tests with assembled sub-systems in positions as installed on vehicles.

**Aluminum Parts Requirements:**
- Aluminum parts in high visible areas must be painted or anodized.

Also: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.

### Electric parts
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (type Gortex), when in wet locations. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. 

Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.

- **Terminals, connectors:** Do not place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness; electrical connections must be protected from humidity. 
- **Groundings:** Connecting surfaces of grounding must be waterproof if placed in a corrosive environment.
- **Aluminium/sealing surfaces:** Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content >1% are very vulnerable to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Corrosion may quickly penetrate the seal, exposing it to moisture.

### Prevention of stone chipping issues
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized using design measures:

- Provide shielding components for vulnerable parts whenever possible.
- Enlarging the radius of parts in high-risk areas can prevent significant problems.
- In areas with high stone impact risks, ensure parts and paint share the same color to avoid visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid designing parts with edges pointing toward the vehicle’s driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the vehicle's lower areas, recess them to diminish stone impact risks.

### 3.6 Traceability
For part requirements, follow the specifications referenced in VinFast Standard VFDST00010501.

### 3.7 Labeling of Parts
The supplier must adhere to VinFast Standard VFDST00000010, including providing imagery detailing label setup and placement on components (position labels with figures).
</page>

<page number="20">
3.8 Operational Strength (Stiffness / Strength / Durability)

- Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions (operating loads and special events).
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics, derived from the application profile.
- Definition of all requirements to ensure sufficient operational strength of complete vehicles, subsystems, and components. This technical specification serves as the basis for all system and component technical specifications.
- Mounting force must be lower than dismounting force.

### Operating Loads
Operating loads are those loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the benchmark base vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast.

- The definition of customer usage is based on VinFast for MCE (Mixed Circuit Europe = long-distance durability run). The tested mileage is derived from the target customer mileage of 160,000 km.
- The vehicle lifetime shall be at least 10 years.
- Environmental operating conditions:
  - -35°C to +90°C ambient.
  - 0 - 100% relative humidity.
  - -100 m to 3500 m above mean sea level.

### Special Events
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approximately < 100) related to the intended vehicle use, such as ABS braking. The vehicle must be dimensioned such that:

- Special events do not affect functionality.
- No safety-relevant damage occurs.
- The intended service life is not reduced.

### Misuse Events
Misuse events are incidents that are not part of the intended vehicle usage, such as kerbstone impact. The vehicle must be dimensioned such that:

- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).
- A defined damage chain is maintained after misuse (e.g., easily replaceable parts before body structure).
- Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations on either the same or neighboring components. This follows the principle of "deformation before break."

The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.

The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

5.3.2 Europe.

a. Homologation and Safety Regulation Activities:
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.

b. Test Report(s) and Certificate(s):
The supplier is responsible for getting their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale.

VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain UN-ECE regulations at authorized technical service(s). The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.

VinFast also requests suppliers to provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings to be submitted to the relevant authorities to obtain certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any).

The supplier should also understand the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

c. Duty to Notify VinFast of a Non-Compliance With UN-ECE Regulations:
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.

The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.

The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
