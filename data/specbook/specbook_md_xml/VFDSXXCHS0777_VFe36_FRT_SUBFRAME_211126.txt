11. Production quality.

11.1 In Process Testing.  
In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuing improvement. Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan. When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked.  

The table that follows summarizes the various IP tests and the acceptance parameters for each. They form the basis on which to develop a complete Control Plan for these and their related significant process characteristics. The Control Plan will include frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.  

**Table of Tests**  
- Refer DVP for all tests  
  - Material Test  
  - Environmental Test  
  - Component/System Level Testing  

11.2 Visual Inspection.  
All parts will be 100% inspected in the formed condition, after heat treatment, and after machining at the time of packing. No surface defects (cracks, notches, malformed areas, etc.) are allowed. These allowable surface defect standards should be made available to the appropriate inspectors and operators at the various manufacturing facilities. The following applies to all surfaces unless otherwise noted.  

11.3 Dimensional Control.  
The production supplier has ultimate responsibility to write the Control Plan and to identify significant characteristics (SC) over and above the significant and critical (SC, CC/) features identified by VinFast. The production supplier is also responsible for establishing initial Process Control and ongoing process capability reporting per VinFast requirement. The Control Plan will identify those features requiring process capability.  

Process capability must be established from 30 pieces randomly selected from a continuous production run of at least 300 pieces. The process capability must meet AIAG PPAP edition 4. Capability data is to be included in the PPAP documentation.  

When process capability has been demonstrated, X bar and R charts must be used for ongoing control of characteristics identified in the Control Plan unless specifically waived by VinFast ATI1. Acceptance of parts by any sampling plan or statistical process control procedure does not relieve the supplier of their responsibility that each part meets all requirements of the purchase order and the component print. If any defects are found during implementation of the in-process sampling plan, the supplier must invoke the reaction plan program specified in the Control Plan.  

Individual VinFast ATI1 departmental requirements for the acceptability of process capability numbers (Cp, Cpk, etc.) may supersede any general guidelines at any time. A documented fail-safe system must be established by the supplier, approved by VinFast, and be in place at all sheet metal fabrication, heat treating, machining, and final assembly facilities/operations to ensure that any non-compliance subframes are removed permanently from the product flow.

12 Quality characteristics and their testing conditions.

12.1 General requirements.
The tests are carried out at room temperature unless specified otherwise / (23 ±5) °C.

12.1.1 Identification marking.
During the manufacturing process, and after quality checks are passed with positive results, each rear axle carrier is provided with standard identification marking. This is mechanically applied by means of an engraving unit in the position according to the drawing. The identification marking must be visible in the installed state and facilitate assignment of the following information:
- **Production data:** Date of manufacture (see Figure 3); Measured values of all features to be measured in accordance with the testing instructions.
- **Control data:** Inspector, exam results (OK/not OK).
- **Reworking data (if applicable):** Defect location, type of defect, worker, examination results.

Figure 3: Example of standard identification marking.
The figure illustrates the identification marking, including information such as calendar week, year, serial number, and shift.

12.2 Semifinished pipes and sheet metal.
Materials are as per component drawings or technical delivery specifications in the parts list of the assembly drawing. The requirements according to the standards listed in the drawing or the supplier’s technical delivery specifications apply with respect to the semi-finished pipes and sheet metal, to the extent no restrictions are noted according to the drawing or in this standard. The requirements are particularly to be interpreted with regard to further intended use as a function-critical chassis component. Verification that the requirements have been satisfied for all component parts is to be provided by means of a "3.2.2" test report as per DIN EN 10 204.

### 12.3 Surface  

#### 12.3.1 Surface Condition  
Component parts are to be further processed to be free of burs (≤ 0.3 mm as per DIN ISO 13715) and without chips. The requirements as per subsection 2.5.3 apply to the rear axle carrier assembly (before paint finishing). The paint application is to be inspected on the finished part in accordance with subsection 12.3.2. Tool-related markings or defects are permitted up to a depth of 0.3 mm. Minimum wall thicknesses shall not be fallen short of; function shall not be impaired.  

#### 12.3.2 Surface Treatment  
##### 12.3.2.1 Requirements  

**General Requirements**  
VFDST00003500 shall be applied for the pretreatment and cathodic dip painting of steel components. A continuous processing time of the components shall be met via the total processing time in the pre-treatment and painting unit. There shall not be any subdivision of the processing time over the whole production process due to the risk of basic material corrosion. If this requirement is not adhered to, suitable measures shall be taken to prevent basic material corrosion within the storage time. Verifications to this effect shall be documented.  

**Surface state of the developing article according to the pre-treatment processes, ie before coating**  
After the pre-treatment processes there may be no residues (e.g. branded oils/lubricants) present on the surface which has a negative effect on the subsequent processes. A check can be made, for example, in accordance with the ASTM standard (water breaking test). Silicate and smoke residues (scaling) and impurities in front and back areas around the welding seams as well as the heat-affected zones around them must be removed to such an extent that the formation of an all-over phosphate layer is possible.  

**Phosphating**  
Subsequently, a phosphate surface coat with a coating weight of 5 ±3 g/m² shall be applied to internal surfaces, to external surfaces, and to welding seams. For hollow profiles, an immersion process is absolutely required. Thick-layer cathodic dip painting with edge optimization. Coating: acc. to drawing.  

The following coating thicknesses must be adhered to:  
| **Surface**   | **Minimum** | **Target Value** | **Maximum** |  
|---------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|  
| Outside       | 35 μm       | 40 μm            | 50 μm       |  
| Inside        | 20 μm       | -                | -           |  
| Edges         | 8 μm        | -                | -           |  

The maximum for external surfaces only applies to the bolting areas marked according to the drawing. Minimum paint coat thickness at the edges shall be verified. Burrs shall be met according to VDI guideline 2906 sheet 1 and sheet 2. There shall not be any defective KTL locations (e.g. due to missing ventilation holes, output holes, and coating holes). KTL contact points shall be placed so that they are covered later in the assembly.  

**KTL Drying at Object Temperature**  
Minimum 165 °C and 15-minute baking duration, maximum 200 °C and 10-minute baking duration. For details, refer to the KTL supplier baking window. The KTL paint shall be fully cured.
