5 Description and scope of work.

5.1 Technical requirement.

5.1.1 Project Requirements.

5.1.1.1 Quality Requirements.  
Please refer to VinFast "Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements".  
The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.  
The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.  

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging and logistic specifications, etc.).  

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.  

The finished assembly should meet all dimensional and form tolerance according to VFDST00000013.  

- The assembly structure should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.  
- Should be designed for high-volume production.  
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime.  
- Emit no disturbing noises.  
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.  

**Visual Appearance:**  
The Fuel Filler Lid Outer Panel surface to meet A-Class surface condition.  

5.1.1.2 Certification.  
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing, and component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely responses to failure reports found.

- Conformance to prohibited and restricted substances must be ensured for all types of parts, including new, modified, carry-over, off-the-shelf, and spare parts through the entire product life cycle.
- PPAP material data sheets (MDS) based on IMDS Rules and Guidelines (IMDS 001 and IMDS Recommendations 002-022) are required, with updates for changes.
- Material data sheets must be submitted to VINFAST under Project VINFAST IMDS-ID @ XXX.

### Parts Marking:
Parts marking should follow the rule of “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO prioritized), displayed in arrowed brackets using “more than” (>) and “less than” (<) symbols.

### Material Safety Data Sheets:
Material Safety Data Sheets (SDS) compliant with Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including national chemical inventory 2017) must be provided for concept confirmation milestones. Compliance should consider local SDS creation rules and UN-GHS guidelines.

### Recycling:
#### Recycled Materials:
When selecting materials, focus should be on reducing material variety and compatibility with recycling technologies.

#### Recycling Scheme:
This chapter outlines requirements for recycling and repair schemes during component development. Recycling designs need to ensure cost-effective end-of-life recycling and involve layouts specifying the recycling process, preferred partners, and cost estimates.  
The recycling scheme must be provided to VINFAST environmental experts before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

<page number="17">
For the series, the side door sash frame assembly will be supplied unpainted by the supplier. The surface is slightly oiled but free of oil accumulations. Suitable measures must be provided for material combinations on the support structure, e.g., steel/AL/Mg.

For corrosion reasons, the parts must be loaded in covered areas protected from the weather (rain, snow). Parts must be transported in closed transport vehicles (e.g., trucks with tarpaulin).

Generally:
For the determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosively position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosively Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosively Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
3. **High corrosively:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very high corrosively:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

**Corrosion tests:** The parts have to pass complete vehicle corrosion tests.

---

### 5.4 Traceability
For part requirements, follow specifications stated in VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

**Labeling of Parts:** Suppliers must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010.

---

### 6 Testing and Validation

DVP and PC test responsibility follow RASIC.

**Testing requirements:** 
- **Scope:** DVP (virtual and physical testing) for System, Sub-system & Component Level in-line with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase. 
- **Detailed test plan:** Specific hardware tests documented in file DVP&R must be provided in collaboration with the Testing & Validation department. This includes:
