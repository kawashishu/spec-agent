IP Center Speaker Strategy.

**Requirements:**  
During the stiffness- and rigidity testing, there must not be any permanent deformations, no breakage, and no customer-relevant modifications.

**Most Important Functions of Cockpit:**  
- Optical trim.  
- Absorption of noises.  
- Absorbing properties in case of head-impact.  
- Integration of add-on parts.  
- Has to fulfill all functions over its lifetime.

**Crosscarbeam IP:**  
- The cross car beam (CCB) should be used as the main fixation of the IP.  
- Master Reference Point between IP main carrier and CCB in Y=0.  
- Input about the kind of fixation and stiffness is defined from SDS IP.  
- Technical CCB specifications defined in the spec book CCB.

**Airbag Door:**  
The airbag door contains an invisible breakup solution. Therefore, the lid-carrier is horizontally divided, if possible symmetrical. If the supplier has the opinion that another airbag door solution fulfills the requirements in a better way, the supplier has the responsibility to inform, present, and discuss the concept with VinFast.

- The split line has to be invisible on the dashboard skin (A-surface).  
- The hinge-lines do not show marks on the skin.  
- All break lines of the airbag door are invisible; they can be made by cutting with a cold knife or by laser.  
- The airbag door has to be tested at all temperatures, which means room temperature (+20°C), low temperature (-30°C), high temperature (+85°C), and with all generator loads (Minimum/Nominal/Maximum load).  
- The tolerance for all testing temperatures is ±2.5°C.
</page>

<page number="19">
VinFast proposes to bring in an airbag shooting channel on the backside of the IP, such as vibration welded, ultrasonic welded, or infrared welded. If the supplier has the know-how to develop an injection-molded dashboard with an integrated shooting channel, this solution is also possible, provided no split line is visible on the A-surface of the dashboard and all other requirements mentioned in this technical specification can be fulfilled. The development target is to have no separate door for the passenger airbag.

The integrated airbag door must be firmly attached to the dashboard to avoid any risk of tearing off. No risk of injuries to occupants caused by the instrument panel or the airbag door during and after deployment (collision, secondary collision) has to be assured.

Opening Force of the Airbag Door:
- The opening force of the airbag door must be agreed with the airbag supplier and must be specified in production drawings. As a general rule, the maximum opening force should be less than 2.3 kN.
- For the testing program of the airbag door, refer to the safety and restraint system specification. The appendix of the subsystem technical specification for safety and restraint systems describes the validation program for all development phases.

**Glove Box:**
- The glove box will be newly developed with supplier support. Throughout the development phases, attention must be paid to ensuring the component package’s design is always weight-optimized.
- Reliability of the system must be ensured.
- Fatigue strength and service life of the system must be ensured.
- Attention must be given to all components, factoring in special loading conditions (salt spray test, corrosion test, condensation water test, final rust-proofing, high-pressure cleaning, etc.) to prevent system impairment.
- Full functioning capability in the event of and following temperature and climatic test loads must be maintained.
- Protection against icing must be ensured.

<page number="24">
The vehicle shall enable an acoustics and vibration comfort well balanced with vehicle dynamics and drivability so that long-distance driving comfort as well as driving over rough roads is neither exhausting nor annoying. NVH performance should be aligned with the VTS targets.

**Supplier responsibility**
The validation of NVH and driving comfort will be done on the complete vehicle level and comprises real customer operation conditions. Before the validation on the complete vehicle level takes place, the supplier must assure the readiness of components and systems for durability and general testing. Evidence for the test maturity of the components must be reported in the DVP&R (Design, Verification, and Development Report) at the component level.

System suppliers are required to perform validation activities as specified in respective technical specifications. All parts required for the validation activities are outlined by DVP&R and must meet the required maturity level. Quality criteria and validation methods defined by VinFast must be aligned with suppliers.

It is mandatory for the supplier to actively support the NVH development process and the complete product cycle. This includes cooperation with the development team and manufacturing regarding root cause investigations and collaboration on achieving NVH vehicle-level targets (objective and subjective targets) at both component and system levels.

All components must be free from squeak and rattle noises to avoid psychoacoustic annoyance under all vehicle operation conditions, including audio acoustic excitation. Design robustness must be verified virtually and in the hardware phase before serial release. Actuation noises must not be audible, creating a high-quality impression integrated within the complete vehicle. These requirements apply to all specified environmental and thermal conditions.

During serial manufacturing, a capable quality assurance process must be established to maintain the quality level. The supplier is responsible for providing components for testing and NVH tuning while ensuring the participation of specialists during local testing and troubleshooting processes.

*Content continues in further sections.*
</page>

<page number="33">
Odor behavior requirements for interior components.

The odor behavior of the interior components must be verified according to VDA 270 standards. Testing parameters must be agreed upon with VinFast's specialist department. Suppliers must provide evidence of target value fulfillment, which is <3 for odor behavior per the specification book, before milestone purchase release.

Optional test procedures for odor measurement.

VinFast may define additional test procedures compliant with ISO 12219, part 7 in collaboration with expert teams. Measurement results for components must be submitted prior to purchase release approval.

Interior parts emissions using the bag method.

Interior components, semi-finished products, and surface materials such as artificial leather or films must be tested in compliance with ISO 12219, part 2. Suppliers are required to demonstrate meeting emissions thresholds through defined tests and provide results accordingly.

Harmful substances in components and materials.

The emission behavior of interior component products must be validated as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in passenger compartments need minimization and testing as specified by VinFast. Testing must be conducted at VinFast-approved testing institutes, and suppliers are encouraged to access a list of these institutes.

Testing for VOC and fogging.

Volatile organic compounds in components should be verified according to ISO 12219 standards, ensuring compliance with prohibited substances across the product life cycle. Suppliers are also obligated to provide written attestation for volatile compound harmlessness and submit test results confirming VOC and fogging measurements prior to milestone purchase release.

Limits for harmful emissions from interior components.

- Marking positions of pyrotechnic components must be ensured, especially for hidden components, such as battery safety terminal clamps and active safety headrests.  
- In case of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnic components is required. Pre-dismantling should be avoided if technically possible. Accessibility of fasteners must be ensured.  

Recycling.  

**Recycled Materials.**  
When selecting materials, focus must be placed on reducing the variety of materials and their compatibility with available recycling procedures, referred to as proven recycling technologies. Secondary raw materials, such as recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, and recycled thermoplastics, must be prioritized based on market availability. These materials must be marked according to the specified parts marking standards and reported to the environmental compliance team at VinFast.  

**Recycling Scheme.**  
A general project-wide requirement for recycling and repair schemes is established.  
- Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
- The contractor must provide a recycling scheme showcasing a simple layout of the proposed recycling process for the component. This includes information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimations.  
- The recycling scheme must be submitted to VinFast's environmental expert team before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

Material Requirements & Corrosion.  

**Corrosion Requirements Interior.**  
Screws and bolts on handles and mirrors must meet the specified requirements.
</page>

<page number="35">
Key components subject to corrosion requirements include:

- Seat belts  
- Trunk area  
- Seat structure  
- Invisible structural parts  
- Vehicle tooling  

### General Corrosion Classification  
Corrosivity positions need to be classified for each component in the system as follows:  

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

### Corrosion Tests  
The components must undergo both system/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion testing.  

#### Component Test for Metallic Surfaces  
- **Fog Test:** ISO6270 CH — Acceptance criteria detailed below.  
- **Salt Spray Test:** ISO9227 — Acceptance criteria detailed below.  

#### Component Test for Organic Coatings  
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B — Acceptance criteria detailed below.  

Alternative tests can be proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.  

### Test Criteria Overview  
| **Area**                      | **Corrosivity** | **Metallic Coatings**        | **Organic Coatings**         | **Pass Criteria**        |
|-------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low          | 240 h NSS → ISO9227        | 96 h → ISO6270 CH            | No red rust             |
| Exterior                     | Medium         | 480 h NSS → ISO9227        | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust         |
</page>

<page number="36">
### Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT
- **Rust creep according to ISO4628-8**: 
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1-2 mm.
- **Blistering**: 
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).
- **Edge corrosion**: ≤ 10%.
- **Weld seam corrosion**: ≤ 5%.
- **Degree of rusting**: ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

### Corrosivity Considerations
The interior is primarily considered a dry area, meaning low corrosivity. Exceptions might include floor areas or areas subject to wetness/abrasion from shoes, or exposure to drinking juices which could lead to corrosion.

#### Recommendations:
- Avoid galvanic corrosion by coating parts that combine different metals.
- Ensure painted edges are burr-free for optimal edge coverage and reduced wear.
- Seat structure, uncoated (blank steel): New parts must be corrosion-free and areas with corrosion risk must remain non-visible to the customer, considering extreme positions of the seat-rests.
- Invisible areas may have lower test criteria, ensuring no corrosive products appear in visible areas and full functionality over the component's lifetime.

#### Vehicle Tooling:
Generally stored in the trunk, where exposure to low corrosivity is expected. Tool surfaces subject to wear may have medium corrosivity considerations.

### See Also:
- Corrosion requirements for electrical components.

### Test Plan
The test plan outlines the responsible party, testing schedule, required devices, and documentation processes:
- The test results must always be controlled and visually reviewed.
- If VinFast requests verification, the SDS must deliver the required parts at no cost.
- Test procedures and documentation require approval from VinFast's corresponding test engineer.
- The test plan should be updated weekly or as new development information becomes available.
- SDS is responsible for safeguarding all aspects of the component tests.
- Testing must be scheduled in advance to prevent delays in approval or re-testing in case of negative results.
- VinFast must have access to all relevant test protocols/reports and the ability to attend tests at SDS or its facilities.

#### Deviations:
Any deviation from approved testing procedures requires mutual agreement between VinFast and SDS.
</page>

<page number="37">
If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts or different testing procedures, the testing must be redone at the cost of SDS. If test results are negative, retesting must be re-planned and paid by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

### Following data must be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.  
- Description of how and with which devices the testing was performed (testing setup details with pictures).  
- Responsible test department.  
- Location of testing (internal/external).  
- Duration and time flow of the testing (presented in project plan format).  
- Part variant and description of part.  
- Number of tested components/parts.  

The SDS is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by the VinFast testing department. Initial data must be filled by the SDS and submitted to VinFast within four weeks from the nomination of the SDS. A DVP must be planned for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

The sequence of testing and the number of test specimen must be determined in cooperation with the validation engineer and component lead engineer at VinFast. The test plan must be coordinated and jointly approved by VinFast departments and the SDS. Regular weekly reviews of the DVP&R must occur after milestone concept confirmation (milestone CC). Any scheduling delay must be accompanied by proposals from SDS to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS is required to create a test plan for each single component.
