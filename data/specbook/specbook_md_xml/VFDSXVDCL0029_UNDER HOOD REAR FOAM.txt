5 Description and scope of work

5.1 Technical requirement

5.1.1 Project Requirements  
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product, and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing, and component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for a timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.  
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. The supplier must complete all component/subsystem tests.  
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.  
- In any event, the supplier is obligated to complete all specified test requirements.  
- The component/subsystem supplier must provide VINFAST's product release engineer with a complete component/subsystem test certification plan approved by the engineer. The plan shall include at least: number of samples, test sequence, place, and time of each test.  

5.1.2 General Description of the System / Component  
It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.  

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification have to be agreed between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.  

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:  
- System-specific requirements.  
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of system markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.  
- For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time-schedule.  

The technical and commercial release will be processed by the customer according to change management.  

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of system markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class.

- Prohibition and restriction of substances must comply with Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including the national chemical inventory 2017).

- Prohibition and restriction must also adhere to the Global Automotive Declarable Substances List (GADSL).

### Material Information, Parts Marking, and Substance Information

The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances, as well as obligations in terms of notification, must be ensured for the following:
- New parts.
- Modified parts.
- Carry-over parts.
- Off-the-shelf parts.
- Spare parts.

Key points for suppliers:
- Suppliers must ensure compliance with prohibited substances over the complete product lifecycle.

<page number="14">
### 5.1.15.2 Material Information, Parts Marking & Substance Information
The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification must be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier. 

- The conformance to prohibited substances must be ensured by the supplier throughout the complete product life cycle.  
- For PPAP material data sheets (MDS) in IMDS, according to IMDS Rules and Guidelines IMDS 001 and IMDS Recommendations 002-022 are required. Updates are required for changes.  

Material data sheets must be provided by the supplier for VINFAST:  
**Project VINFAST IMDS-ID @ XXXX.**  

Parts marking should follow the rule: "as few characters as possible but as many as necessary." Marking consists of brief type designations as defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO standards take priority). Codes are placed into arrowed brackets ("<" and ">").  

Material safety data sheets (SDS) per Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 and ISO GHS guidelines must be provided for milestone concept confirmation. Refer to the following resources for standards and guidelines:  
- [UNECE GHS Guidelines](http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_welcome_e.html)  
- [GADSL Guidelines](https://www.gadsl.org/).

### 5.1.15.3 Recycling
**Recycled Materials**  
Preference is given to secondary raw materials (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams) over virgin materials. Materials must comply with parts marking standards defined and be reported to VINFAST environmental compliance experts. 

**Recycling Scheme**  
A general recycling scheme for parts at the end-of-life must support cost-effectiveness. Suppliers must provide:  
- A simple layout detailing the recycling process for components  
- Suggested recycling partners  
- Cost estimates  

The recycling scheme must be submitted to VINFAST environmental experts before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### 5.1.16 Geometrical Integration
**Reference Position System (RPS):**  
Testing ranges must correlate with functional areas. Design determination concepts must be consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly. RPS-determination follows VINFAST SE-process standards as per VFDST00000011 [34]. This ensures proper part positioning relative to adjoining parts and provides assembly quality assurance.  

**Tolerance Analyses:**  
Essential tolerance analyses for systems and components include:  
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses  
- Thermal change tests across all climate conditions  
- Thermal expansion considerations
