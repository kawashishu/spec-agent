1. General Information.

The fulfilment of the VinFast specific target values according to interior components spec books must be confirmed via bag-method tests for VOC according to ISO 12219-2, fogging tests according to ISO 6452 (optional DIN 75201-B), and odor tests according to VFDST00031104 (VDA270). The requirements must be confirmed based on pre-series production component testing no later than two weeks before milestone PTO. The supplier must assign a VinFast-approved test laboratory for the testing (Appendix 1).

The following requirements must be considered for defining the test scope and selecting the test samples:
- Test every surface material (e.g., leather, artificial leather, textile, TPO foil).
- Test the color variant "black" (if available) or the darkest color variant.
- Test the component per manufacturing plant (if different locations of manufacturing exist for the same components).

2. Procedure for Interior Emission, Fogging & Odor Testing.

2.1. Sample Taking.

Testing must be carried out with new parts. The test sample is a part used for the interior of a vehicle, including related materials such as glue and coating materials.

Components shall be taken from the serial manufacturing process. If components are unavailable in time before milestone PTO, pre-series production components may be used.

Components must be taken from the final step of the production line and must not be cleaned or treated in any way before testing.

2.2. Part History Document.

The supplier must provide all material data, including technical data sheets and material safety data sheets for each test sample.

Furthermore, every component must include a part history document according to Appendix 3. The supplier must provide this document before component testing. If no part history document is provided, the test results will not be accepted by VinFast.

The part history document (including a photo of the component) must be sent via email to the contact persons at VinFast (Chapter 3).

### 2.3 Wrapping

The components should be protected against chemical contamination, heat, and moisture. Therefore, the test samples have to be wrapped and welded into an emission-tight aluminum composite foil according to DIN 55531-Type 1 (Appendix 2) after they are taken from the manufacturing process.

- Wrapping the samples in conventional aluminum foil, plastic bags, or cardboard/paper packaging materials is NOT allowed.
- The test samples have to be wrapped as soon as possible (within 2 to 8 hours) after production.

**Exception:**  
Laminating adhesives, which have to evaporate. In this case, the test sample has to be wrapped after curing.

---

### 2.4 Transport

After wrapping the sample in aluminum foil (with the shiny side outside), it has to be put into a polyethylene bag or in a bag lined with transparent polyvinyl fluoride foil. To prevent aging due to the influence of light, the samples should be transported and stored in a carton.

- The samples have to be tested within 4 weeks after production and as soon as possible after arriving at the laboratory.
- If the samples have to be stored before the testing, the packaging should not be opened.

**Documentation Requirements:**  
- The storage period and storage conditions have to be documented.
- Any deviations in the sample conditioning must be documented in the test report.

**Labeling Instructions:**  
The wrapped bags must be furnished with a label on the outside that contains the following specifications:

1. Name of the producer.
2. Date of wrapping.
3. Responsible person of the test material/sample.
4. Name and charge number of the material/sample.
5. Comment on the bag: “emission proof wrapping – DO NOT OPEN!”

**Customs Documentation:**  
Ensure to write down in the customs documents that the bag must not be opened.

---

### Figure Description

**Picture 1:** The label on the outside of the bag includes specifications and a clear warning:  
- **Text Content:**  
  *Emission test material  
  DO NOT OPEN!!*  
  -> see customs documents  
- **Purpose:** To ensure proper handling and prevent unauthorized opening of samples required for testing.

### 2.4 Transport

After wrapping the sample in aluminum foil (with the shiny side outside), it must be put into a polyethylene bag or a bag lined with transparent polyvinyl fluoride foil. To prevent aging due to light exposure, samples should be transported and stored in a carton.

- Samples must be tested within **4 weeks** after production and as soon as possible after arriving at the laboratory.  
- If samples need storage before testing, the packaging must not be opened.  
- Any deviations in the sample conditioning during storage must be documented in the test report.

**Labeling Requirements:**  
The wrapped bags must have a label containing the following specifications:  
a. Name of producer   
b. Date of wrapping   
c. Responsible person of the test material/sample   
d. Name and charge number of the material/sample   
e. Comment on the bag: “emission proof wrapping – DO NOT OPEN!”

---

### 2.5 Test Laboratories

All emission tests must be executed by test laboratories accepted by VinFast. An overview of the accepted test laboratories is provided in Appendix 1.

The test laboratory is responsible for generating a complete test report, including all measurement protocols and chromatographs. This report must be forwarded to VinFast.

The original measurement data must be sent to VinFast by the test laboratory.  
Contact: **See Chapter 4.**

### 3. VOC Targets

VOC target values for components are specified in terms of odor, fogging, and bag-method ISO 12219-2. Below are the thresholds for each component:

#### Odor and Fogging Targets:
For all components, odor rating (VDA 270) must be ≤ 3.0 for most items (≤ 3.5 for some), and fogging (DIN 75201-B) must be ≤ 2.

#### Bag-method ISO 12219-2 Targets:
Components have various thresholds for TVOC, benzene, toluene, dimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene, phenyl ethylene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein, determined by their respective bag sizes.

For example:
- **Front Seat**: (Bag size: 1000 liters)
  - TVOC: Reporting only
  - Benzene: ≤ 25 µg
  - Toluene: ≤ 150 µg
  - Dimethylbenzene: ≤ 150 µg
  - Ethylbenzene: ≤ 80 µg
  - Phenyl ethylene: ≤ 80 µg
  - Formaldehyde: ≤ 80 µg
  - Acetaldehyde: ≤ 20 µg
  - Acrolein: ≤ 15 µg

- **Rear Seat**: (Bag size: 2000 liters)
  - TVOC: Reporting only
  - Benzene: ≤ 60 µg
  - Toluene: ≤ 400 µg
  - Dimethylbenzene: ≤ 300 µg
  - Ethylbenzene: ≤ 180 µg
  - Phenyl ethylene: ≤ 180 µg
  - Formaldehyde: ≤ 180 µg
  - Acetaldehyde: ≤ 40 µg
  - Acrolein: ≤ 20 µg

The detailed table lists similar thresholds for all components including carpets, mats, headliners, trim, pillars, consoles, and steering wheels.
