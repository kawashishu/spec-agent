- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS must use the DVP&R template provided by the VINFAST testing department. They are responsible for the complete DVP&R content. Test plans for each development stage, prototype (if specified in the master timing chart), and serial stage must be prepared.

Testing must involve the worst-case component/system variant and combine mechanical and electrical tests where possible to avoid redundancy. The sequence and test specimen number must be determined jointly with VINFAST validation engineers and component lead engineers. The DVP&R plan must be agreed upon by the VINFAST test department (SQA) and the SDS prior to concept confirmation (milestone CC). Weekly reviews are required post-milestone, with SDS delivering scheduling delay resolutions as needed.

Upon request, test plans for individual components must be drawn up by the SDS.

### Testing
#### General
The SDS must prepare a comprehensive, detailed testing plan aligned with the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.16). Double testing must be avoided by combining mechanical and electrical tests wherever possible.

The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded. These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VINFAST and the SDS, and will be binding. 

If VINFAST orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge. 

### Geometrical Integration

**RPS (Reference Position System):**  
The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. A RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS-system VFDST00000011 [34] according to the interior and BIW department.

**Tolerance Analyses:**  
The following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms.
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.

Arrangements are necessary in order to ensure the given gap dimension of components.

**Clearance Wiring Harness:**  
A clearance of min. 8mm to the wiring harness is needed. 

Shape and position tolerances [15] and general tolerances [16] have to be considered.
