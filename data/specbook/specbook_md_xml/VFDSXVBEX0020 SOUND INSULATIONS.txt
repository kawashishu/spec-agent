**Performance Specification**

**NVH and Driving Comfort.**  
The VINFAST target system for Exterior Trims is oriented towards reference vehicles.  

The system must not cause any kind of disturbing sound such as relative movement, wind noise, squeak, rattle, temperature, or flexural torsion during any operation. All possible appropriate measures must be taken to prevent operating noises such as wind noise and whining noise completely or absorb and deaden them as much as possible to achieve acceptable noise levels.  

The gas- and water-tightness serve as the foundation for acoustical tightness and must be appropriately and sufficiently achieved. Chattering or squeaking effects, which may occur during high-speed vehicle driving or at specific humidity levels, must be avoided through suitable profile designs and the choice of high-quality surface coating processes paired with durable material compositions.  

All components of the seal system must be designed to reduce aerodynamic resistance and achieve optimal aero-acoustic characteristics. Sub-components must not have burrs related to the manufacturing process unless approved by the functional specialist. All fixation points, such as screws and clips, must be air-tight sealed, with exceptions requiring approval by the functional specialist.  

Components must be mechanically stable at the highest possible speed range. No deformation is allowed for components. Flat surfaces must be supported with appropriate stiffening structures beneath. Components must remain stable over their lifetime and withstand temperature, moisture, dirt, and UV radiation exposure without deformation or shrinkage. Adhesion properties of glues must meet specified targets. Noise generation at components and joints must be avoided.  

The supplier is required to guarantee:  
- No amplification of wind noise and vibrations on BIW.  
- No whistling, buzzing, squeaking, or rattling noises during high-speed driving.  
- Fulfillment of all functions under all operational and environmental conditions.  

**Absorption Targets.**  
The supplier shall ensure these targets for bulkhead insulation.

## Performance Specification: NVH and Driving Comfort

The VinFast target system for Exterior Trims is oriented towards reference vehicles. The system must avoid any form of disturbing sounds, including those caused by relative movement, wind noise, squeaks, rattles, temperature changes, or flexural torsion during operation. Appropriate measures must be taken to completely prevent operating noise such as wind and whining noises or to absorb and deaden them to the greatest extent possible, ensuring a comfortable noise profile.

- **Gas- and water-tightness** are fundamental for achieving acoustic tightness and should be sufficiently ensured.
- **Chattering or squeaking effects**, especially during high-speed driving or at certain humidity levels, should be avoided through suitable profile design and high-quality materials. This includes surface coating processes that maintain durability.
- All seal system components must be designed to reduce aerodynamic resistance and ensure optimum aero-acoustic characteristics.
- Subcomponents must not have manufacturing-related burrs unless explicitly approved by the function specialist. All fixation points, such as screws or clips, must be air-tight sealed, unless exceptions are approved.
- Components must be mechanically stable across the highest speed ranges, maintaining the specified shape and function over their entire life cycle. Flat surfaces require appropriate stiffening structures.
- Components must withstand life cycle conditions like temperature, moisture, dirt, UV radiation, and must resist deformation or shrinkage.
- Adhesive materials should retain specified adhesion levels, and noise generation at components and joints must be avoided.

### Supplier Guarantees
The supplier must ensure the following:
- No amplification of wind noise and vibrations on the body-in-white (BIW).
- Absence of whistling, buzzing, squeaking, or rattling noises during high-speed driving.
- Full functionality across the entire range of operating and environmental conditions.

### Absorption Targets
For bulkhead insulations, the supplier must meet the following specifications:

#### Nominal Absorption Targets
- Equivalent absorption area is based on 0.36m² area.
- Frequency range and equivalent absorption targets are as follows:
  - **400 Hz**: 0.08 m²
  - **500 Hz**: 0.13 m²
  - **630 Hz**: 0.18 m²
  - **800 Hz**: 0.22 m²
  - **1000 Hz**: 0.27 m²
  - **1250 Hz**: 0.31 m²
  - **1600 Hz and above up to 10,000 Hz**: 0.36 m²

*Note: Targets will be adjusted if size changes are made.*

## Performance Specification  
### NVH and Driving Comfort  
The VinFast target system for exterior trims is oriented on reference vehicles. The system must not cause any kind of disturbing sound (relative movement, wind noise, squeak and rattle, temperature, flexural torsion) during any operation. All possible measures must be taken to prevent operating noises such as wind noise and whining noise, either completely or absorb/deaden them to the greatest extent possible to achieve acceptable noises.

The gas- and water-tightness are the basics for acoustical tightness and must be appropriately and sufficiently achieved. Chattering or squeaking effects that occur especially at high speeds or certain humidity levels must be avoided by means of a suitable profile design and the right surface coating process. This process must involve high-quality material pairing (material matching) that offers adequate durability too.

All seal system components must be designed to reduce aerodynamic resistance and optimize aero-acoustic characteristics. Sub-components must not have any burrs related to the manufacturing process unless approved by the function specialist. All fixation points (such as screws and clips) must be tightly sealed. Exceptions can occur only with prior approval from the function specialist.

Components must exhibit mechanical stability at the highest speed ranges. Flat surfaces must be supported by appropriate stiffening structures underneath. Over the design life, components must remain stable, without deformation, shrinkage, or effects due to temperature, moisture, dirt, or UV radiation. Adhesive materials must maintain their specified adhesion properties. Noise generation at components and joints must be avoided actively.

#### Supplier Guarantees  
The supplier must guarantee the following:  
- Prevention of wind noise and vibrations amplification on BIW.  
- Avoid whistling, buzzing, squeaking, and rattling noises during high-speed driving.  
- Fulfillment of all functions across the operating and environmental conditions.

### 5.3 Material Requirement & Corrosion.

Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts. 

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).

- Avoid water and dirt accumulation and always provide drainage in lowest positions.  
- Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro-movements.  
- Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.  
- **Edge coverage:** Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

Test criteria for high visible parts require 720 hours of NSS ISO 9227 without change to the surface. Areas with crevices must be especially checked. Component tests must be executed with assembled sub-systems, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

**Aluminium parts:**  
Aluminium parts in high visible areas must be painted or anodized.  
- Test criteria for painted aluminium follow the specified criteria for organic coatings.  
- Test criteria for anodized aluminium require 480 hours of NSS ISO 9227 without any change to the surface.  
Component testing must be carried out on assembled sub-systems wherever possible, and components must be tested in their installed vehicle position.  

**Chromed metal parts:**  
Chromed metal parts must undergo 240 hours of NSS ISO 9227 with no base material corrosion.

**Chromed plastic parts:**  
Chromed plastic parts must pass CASS-Test according to DIN EN ISO 9227 with the following durations:

5.3 Material requirement & Corrosion. 

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Reason: Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.

### Prevention of stone chipping issues:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.  
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.  
- In areas of high stone hitting risk, choose part materials and paint which have the same colour to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.  
- Avoid developing parts which have edges pointing in the vehicles’ driving direction.  
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them, so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.

### Heat resistance:
- The materials of the component have to be chosen for use in an environment with long-term temperature of 80°C (minimum) and short-term temperature of 90°C (minimum).  
- Above this temperature, additional insulators or reflectors can be implemented. The additional parts must be confirmed in complete vehicle validation.

### Burning behaviour:
- Flame retardant sort of material.  
- The component is located in the engine compartment and shall be tested for burning behaviour according to VFDST00032600 (following UN R 118 and NFPA 556). The tests must be carried out according to DIN 75200. The maximum burning rate is 75 mm per minute. During flame application within 15 seconds, the burnt distance shall not exceed 38 mm.

### Water and Splash Resistance:
