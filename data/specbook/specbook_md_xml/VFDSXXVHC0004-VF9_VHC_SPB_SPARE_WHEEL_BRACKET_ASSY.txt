**3.2.1 General Description of the Component**  
The development object includes the assembly of the spare wheel bracket. The bracket should withstand all the forces occurred by the weight of the spare wheel while driving and ensure the desired position in the interior of the vehicle. (see Figure 2)  

The target of the development is to achieve a weight-optimized, cost-efficient design considering the technical provisions.  

Refer to the 2D drawing and DVP document for more details of the functional requirements.  

**Figure 2: Position of spare wheel**  
The figure showcases the location and alignment of the spare wheel within the vehicle interior, ensuring accessibility, stability during driving, and compliance with design parameters.
