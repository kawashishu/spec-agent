**General Description of the System / Component**

It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification are to be agreed between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:
- The trim-specific requirements.
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of selling markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.

For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, weight, quality, and time-schedule. The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of selling markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class B and C common platform. VINFAST will also monitor ongoing changes of rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.

The supplier delivers the trim parts as a module (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated). Add-on parts not included in the development range of the supplier are to be taken into consideration as purchase parts. Add-on parts are: Electrical components and COP parts.

For the documentation of the release, the following sheets and documents are necessary:
- Drawings
- Simulations (e.g. mold flow analysis)
- Quality regulations

The supplier delivers the trim parts as module (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated). Add-on parts not included in the development range of the supplier are to be taken into consideration as purchase parts. Add-on parts are: Electrical components and COP parts.

For the documentation of the release following sheets and documents are necessary:
- Drawings.
- Simulations (e.g. mold flow analysis).
- Quality regulations.
- Results/documentation of test validation.
- Documentation of the FMEA.

All parts of the assembly must be matched to each other. Functional dimensions must be fulfilled according to the prescription.

Function Requirements.

Most important function of components:
- Covering of BIW and other systems according to styling requirements, considering targets of legal/market requirements.
- Noise absorption.
- Integration of add-on parts.
- Providing full functionality over lifetime.

Overall Function.

Development targets:
- Prevention of functional and qualitative problems out of known systems.
- Use of standard and common parts if possible or reasonable.
- Process reliability at production, packaging, transport and assembly.
- Minimize effort of overall production sequence: production, packaging, transport, and assembly on line.
- Prevention of displacement.
- Integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of the part package (Simultaneous Engineering) from the concept phase onward. Early inclusion of the developers of neighboring components (body shell, finishers etc.).
- General reduction of cost compared to predecessor models.
- Further improvement of the acoustic, optical, and functional characteristics.
- Functionality has to be ensured within temperature range -30°C (-5°C for Vietnam market) till +85°C in areas above belt line, -30°C (-5°C for Vietnam market) till +85°C in areas below belt line.

Stiffness / Rigidity / Stability of Shape.
- Especially in the area of the operating elements, the components and bracket design has to assure that no instability is noticeable.
- Irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, visible waviness under climatic change loads are prohibited.

Trim Parts Requirements.
No detaching, fracturing, or splitting of parts is allowed, neither at crash tests nor at airbag deployment, even not in low temperature range.
</page>

<page number="10">
Product characteristics.

- The components of the trim parts must be designed in consideration of all tolerances of parts and assemblies including heat extension.
- The function of the component must be proven in consideration of all existing tolerances including heat extension.
- Material-specific thermal expansions must be considered during the definition of gap tolerances.
- Deformation after climate tests must stay within the fixed tolerance of flush and gap dimensions.
- Tolerance analyses must be submitted to the responsible departments or persons in charge of the development.
- Assemblability with adjoining components.
- Bolt mountings must include a metallic insert.
- Function safety under all loads stated in drawings, test specifications, quality specifications, and legal texts.
- Noise caused by the function of components or joints due to unfavorable tolerances must be avoided.
- Proof of compliance with legal safety requirements must be provided.
- Climatic requirements must conform to VINFAST standards.
- Clips and screws must be used for fastening.
- Trim parts must not prevent the functionality of other systems, such as curtain airbags, side airbags, and safety belts.
- Full functionality of all components must be ensured for the entire temperature range.
- Curtain airbag and side airbag deployment must not cause parts to break away.
- After a crash, parts must not become loose, and sharp-edged breakups are prohibited.
- Screwed fastenings must prevent shrinkage behaviors caused by terminal forces or lifetime, ensuring secure attachment.
- Trim edges to sealing flanges must exhibit consistent relationships.

By using pyrotechnical belt retractors, material with lower flammability must be employed within a 20mm radius; otherwise, greater clearance is required.

Materials.

- Material and production-compliant designs must avoid surface flaws or defects, such as tool parting points, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, and stress zones.
- Designs must support material-compliant fits, curvatures, and corners, allowing visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces.
- Uniform and material-compliant run-out of edges, corners, and ribs is required.
- Selected concepts and methods must support homogeneous structures and grain patterns.
- Visible screw points, screw point covers, and dummy covers should be avoided.
- Visual and haptic zones must maintain surface integrity free from burrs.
</page>

<page number="11">
No view of other parts. It should not be possible to recognize other components through grilles, trim covers, indentations, joints, and cavities; a neat and tidy overall impression must be ensured.

Ensuring correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts with regard to disturbance noise. Free of disturbing noise and odor when in contact with the environment at all temperatures and driving conditions. 

Surfaces have to be designed according to DINENISO 1302 [14]. Quality requirements at suppliers for production materials are based on “N85065” [40]. 

To coordinate the form and the surface, corresponding samples, including the Cubing report and Appearance Approval reports (see VFDST00038400 [12] Color matching / Appearance Approval and VDA 280 part 1 [47]), have to be presented by the supplier to the corresponding approval offices of VINFAST. Matching parts must be provided by the supplier, adhering to the timeline set by the matching department.

### Variants
Variants by different colors are possible. These are described in the VINFAST Feature-List.

### Interfaces
The components must be designed such that the function is guaranteed in combination with adjoining systems, considering tolerances and thermal influences. The interfaces must be worked out by the system developer in consideration of a quality method (e.g., FMEA, risk filter).  

- **A-pillar trim**: Has to be designed with overlap to the headliner.  
- **B-, C-, and D-pillar trims**: No visible gap between pillar trims and the headliner.

### Adjoining Components
The following adjoining components must be considered:  
- BIW  
- Parcel shelf  
- C-Pillar trim upper/lower  
- Rear seat  
- Safety belt rear  
- Wiring harness
