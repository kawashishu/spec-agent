### Material Requirements & Corrosion  

#### Corrosion Requirements Interior:  
Screws, bolts on Handles, mirror.  
Key.
</page>

<page number="34">
Seat belts.  
Trunk area.  
Seat structure.  
Invisible structural parts.  
Vehicle tooling.

Generally:  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  

1. Corrosivity Low:  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. Corrosivity Medium:  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. High corrosivity:  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. Very high corrosivity:  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

Corrosion tests:  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

Component test for Metallic surfaces:  
- Fog test: ISO6270 CH, acceptance criteria detailed below.  
- Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria detailed below.  

For Organic coatings:  
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria detailed below.  

**Alternative tests are possible** if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test criteria:  
| Area                   | Corrosivity       | Metallic coatings              | Organic coatings                | Pass criteria             |
|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low               | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227           | 96 h → ISO6270 CH               | No red rust              |
| Exterior               | Medium           | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227           | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust          |
| High & not visible for customer / High & visible | Medium/High      | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227        | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust / CCT: See below |
</page>

<page number="35">
Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:
- **Rust creep according to ISO4628-8:**  
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.  

- **Blistering:**  
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  

- **Edge corrosion:**  
  - ≤ 10%.  

- **Weld seam corrosion:**  
  - ≤ 5%.  

- **Degree of rusting:**  
  - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

The interior is generally considered as a dry area, meaning areas with low corrosivity. Exceptions may include the floor area or other areas where wetness/abrasion by shoes or spilled liquids like juices could result in corrosion.

If combining different metals, galvanic corrosion must be prevented by coating such parts. Painted edges should be burr-free to ensure good edge coverage and avoid wear.

### Seat Structure
For uncoated (blank steel) seat structures:  
- New parts must be corrosion-free and areas prone to corrosion must not be visible to customers.  
- Extreme positions of the seat-rests should be given special consideration.  

On invisible areas, the test criteria may be lower than previously mentioned, but visible areas and full function throughout the product lifetime must remain unaffected by corrosive products.

### Vehicle Tooling
Tooling typically stored in the trunk is exposed to low corrosivity, but tool surfaces subject to wear may be exposed to medium corrosivity.

### Corrosion Requirements for Electric Components
Please refer to the dedicated section.

## Test Plan
The test plan regulates the following aspects:  
1. **Testing control and schedule:**  
   - It specifies who is responsible for testing, when it will be conducted, and which testing devices are required.  
   - The plan also records visual results and the progress of testing.

2. **Result validation:**  
   - Test results must always be controlled and verified.  
   - If VinFast requires verification, SDS must provide the necessary parts free of charge.

3. **Documentation and updates:**  
   - Test procedures and documentation must be approved by VinFast's corresponding test engineer.  
   - The test plan must be supplemented or updated weekly or as new development data arises.

4. **Responsibility:**  
   - SDS is accountable for safeguarding component performance.  
   - Testing must be planned to allow for timely approval and potential re-testing in case of negative results.  

5. **Reporting and re-testing:**  
   - SDS must provide relevant test reports/protocols to VinFast for verification.  
   - VinFast may attend testing at SDS facilities or its centers.  

6. **Procedure deviations:**  
   - Any deviations from the approved test procedures must be mutually agreed upon by VinFast and SDS.  

### Test Failure
If the testing was conducted with incorrect parts, missing parts, or deviations in procedure, the tests must be repeated at SDS’s expense. In cases of negative results caused by SDS errors, re-testing costs fall under SDS responsibility.
</page>

<page number="36">
Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible to use the draft DVP&R provided by VINFAST testing department. The initial data filling has to be done by the SDS and has to be submitted to VinFast at least four weeks after the nomination of the SDS.

The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast.

The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department, SQA (VinFast), and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.

The information, such as beginning and end of testing, for the test plan required from the SDS is marked as “red” in the attached example test plan.

### Test plan example
Testing General:
The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.17).
</page>

<page number="37">
It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.

In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS have to be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered from VinFast by the SDS.

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for its component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VFDST requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VinFast.

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be fulfilled.

All tests must be documented according to VF standards, alternatively SDS standards if this is accepted by VinFast.

The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests for the serial development phase according to the specification.

The tests have to be included in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.

Samples for sample inspections must be provided in a timely manner or no later than the agreed date (coordinated with the test department).

Even manual samples can provide sufficient information in certain cases. Measures can thus be introduced in time to avoid assembly problems to ensure the installability of the test parts.

VinFast “Logistics” determines the number of sample parts, VinFast “Purchase” orders the parts.

A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports for the latest build level and test reports for all required tests according to DVP&R. Disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS.

CAD data models in compliance with VinFast requirements must be provided timely for virtual sample manufacturing.

**Marking of sample parts**: According to VF Standard VFDST00008700 [41].

**Preparation of measurement reports**: According to VF Standard VFDST00008900 [43].

**Reference points systems**: According to VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28].

---

### Release by Test Departments

The responsible VinFast test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the SDS and during complete vehicle integration tests.

The SDS must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. In cases of problems (negative test results, incorrect parameters/processes, etc.), the SDS must submit a test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions to keep all milestones and observe all targets.

An OK or NOK result needs to be clearly stated on the first sheet of the report.
</page>

<page number="38">
Analyses and Test Reports.

The SDS must provide measurement reports (VF Standard VFDST00008900 [43]) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during the prototype generations. After individual tests, the test samples must be analyzed in detail.

Measurement and test results must be proven by individual values and documented in a test report. The report must be handed over to the responsible VinFast department for release. Upon request, results along with test documentation (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development) must be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests carried out parallel to series production must be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.

**Test-Report/Information**
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (part number, change index, materials, production process, additives like grease, and any deviation from approved serial process).
- All parts must be labeled with descriptions.
- Explanation of the reason for testing (e.g., negative test results) and attachment of earlier test reports.
- Testing with exact naming of testing standard, norm, legal requirement, or exact descriptions of agreed testing procedures.

**Documentation of Results**
- Short description of the result (pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of whether the result is OK/NOK, pictures of the parts in testing position, etc.).
- Comparison with targets outlined in specification books, testing specifications, and legal requirements.
- Recommendations regarding the tested components.
- Description of corrective measures or further approaches if negative results occur.
- Progress of testing status.
- Table listing all tests along with responsible personnel, part status, comparison of target date and due date. For negative test results, the SDS must provide new dates for retesting and countermeasures for VinFast’s approval, including responsible personnel and company for conducting the test.

**Progress of Testing Status**
All tests must be listed in a table with details such as the responsible personnel, part status, comparison of target date and due date. For negative test results, the supplier must propose new dates for retesting and countermeasures for VinFast’s approval, along with the necessary personnel and company details.

The VinFast test engineer must be periodically informed of testing progress and the actual status. If VinFast orders testing parts, the detailed description of those parts must be attached.
</page>

<page number="39">
**Archival storage of tested parts.**  
Testing parts may only be scrapped with the agreement of the VinFast test department. On demand, the complete testing documentation, including reports, parts, and descriptions, must be presented to the test engineer.

**BIW-supports, testing devices, and equipment.**  
The number and configuration of BIW-supports are to be aligned with VinFast's test department. VinFast provides BIW supports for the period of testing.  

The number and structures for testing, such as vibration testing devices and devices for environmental testing, must also be aligned with VinFast's test department. The SDS must prove that all testing equipment complies with the corresponding testing instruction.  

**Details required for test samples and reports:**  
- Drawing Number  
- Part Number  
- Release Number  
- Change Index  
- Production and Delivery Date

**Virtual testing.**  
Suitable calculation methods must be used to create adequately detailed calculation models to secure, verify, and optimize the component’s technical specifications, test procedures, and compliance with regulations. These models must secure requirements relating to mechanical properties such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety by FEM calculations.

Tool dimensioning for injection molding must be optimized using corresponding simulations. Upon request, VinFast may access operative calculation models representing the development status for internal calculations and integration work.  

Suppliers are required to provide FEM models upon request to VinFast without extra cost. Before tool dimensioning, the supplier must calculatively document tests using FEM according to the evaluation plan.

**Component Testing.**  
Component tests represent the basic required tests. The detailed required testing is outlined within the DVP and must be agreed upon between VinFast and the SDS.  

- **Climatic Change Test:**  
  - Test conducted according to VFDST00046100 [35].  
  - Runtime of approximately 226 hours, with climatic and high/low temperature cycles applied to test parts.

### Durability Run / Testing of Operating Interior Parts  
Evaluation of operating interior parts due to changes caused by customer-related handling during vehicle lifetime. The climatic chamber must be able to reach specified temperature and humidity values.

#### Test Mission:  
Examination of characteristic values.  
Evaluation of new properties and changes due to simulated lifetime demands on interior parts.  
Testing parts are to be evaluated and released by SDS following these criteria:  
- Geometric changes.  
- Surface issues.  
- Changes in functionality.  
- Failures or fractures.  
- Cracks or crazes.  

Deformations are only acceptable if they do not affect function and appearance. Breaks, surface changes, tears, or similar damages in operating areas are not allowed. Changes such as the control force and opening times must adhere to specified requirements.  

### Test Coverage:  
Test set-up includes parts representative of serial material, process, geometry, and surface (e.g., paint or coating). Different variants and optional equipment must also be tested.  

#### Tests to be Performed:  

**Function Tests:**  
- Room temperature: 23°C ±5°C – Evaluation of function, force, and speed.  
- Low temperature: -20°C – Evaluation of function only.

Mechanical integration tests.

The following tests will be performed as mechanical integration tests in a complete car:
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100) [32].
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800) [37].
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000) [48].
</page>

<page number="49">
 Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00008500) [36].

Basically no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range is allowed. In particular, by the use of materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients, the behavior has to be kept.

The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.

These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VinFast and the SDS and will be binding.

If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

### Geometrical Integration

#### General
See General Engineering Requirements for Suppliers.

RPS (reference position system): The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. A RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS-system and VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28] according to interior and BIW-department.

#### Tolerance analyses:
Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms.
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.

#### Interfaces
The components must be designed such that the function is guaranteed in combination with the adjoining systems. The interfaces must be worked out in cooperation with VinFast in consideration of a quality method (e.g., FMEA, risk filter).

#### Proposal VinFast:
BIW.
