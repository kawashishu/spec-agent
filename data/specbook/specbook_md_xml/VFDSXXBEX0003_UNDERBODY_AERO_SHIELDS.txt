3.2.2 Function.

Main Functions:
- Assist in aerodynamic performance of the vehicle.
- Reduction in external noise transmission to passenger compartment.
- Reduction in noise transmission from Engine / E Motor to outside thereby making the whole vehicle quieter.
- Protection of underbody components against stone chipping, water, mud, dirt, etc.

3.3 General CAE Requirements.

Refer to SOR: VFSRXXCVC0201 DSUV_Appendix_2_CAE_FEM_General requirements.

3.4 Material requirement & Corrosion.

Prohibited or Restricted Substances, Emissions & Toxicology:
The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification must be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier through the complete product lifecycle according to VFDST00007601. IMDS material data sheets must be submitted into VinFast IMDS according to the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and VFDST00007601. Specific targets relating to vehicle indoor air quality must be according to VFDSXVCV3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline. 

Additionally, refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity.
</page>

<page number="11">
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In the case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added, such as paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers. 

Water and dirt accumulation should be avoided, and drainage should be provided in the lowest positions. Dirt traps, where sand can act as an abrasive and damage the painted body through micro movements, should also be avoided. 

Contact surfaces to the body must remain dry, be large enough for low pressure, and consist of non-abrasive material. Micro-movement should be minimized. 

Edge coverage requirements include ensuring burr-free edges and using a paint system with excellent edge coverage. 

### Corrosion Tests:
Parts must undergo system/component tests as well as complete vehicle corrosion tests. 

#### Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:
**Salt Spray Test:** ISO 9227 (acceptance criteria listed below).

#### For Organic Coatings:
**Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT):** ISO 11997 Cycle B (acceptance criteria listed below).

Alternative tests can be proposed by suppliers and accepted by corrosion engineers.

### Degree of Rusting:  
- **Threshold:** ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO 4628-3).  

---

### Stainless Steel:  
- Direct contact with other metals must be avoided to prevent galvanic corrosion; insulating coatings are typically required.  
- **Test criteria for high visible parts:**  
  - 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without surface change.  
  - Particular attention must be given to areas with crevices.  

- Components should be tested as assembled sub-systems in their installed position on the vehicle.  

---

  - Interior: 24 hours.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** No surface defects.  
- Additionally, testing must achieve 240 h NSS ISO 9227 without surface defects.  

---

### Electric Parts:  
- Electrical units within casings and boxes containing enclosed air volumes must be ventilated using a wetness-resistant membrane (such as Gortex) in locations exposed to moisture.  

- **Material Selection Guidelines:**  
  - Material combinations must prevent galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and brackets.  
  - Avoid contact with noble metals (e.g., steel, stainless steel) and conductive or anti-static rubber in wetness-prone areas.  
  - Use corrosion-resistant surface treatments for steel fasteners compatible with other materials.  

- **Installation Requirements:**  
  - Electrical components must be installed in a manner that minimizes vibration-induced fretting corrosion.
</page>

<page number="13">
Terminals, connectors: Do not place terminals in the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness. Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.

Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of >1% are highly sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Reason: Corrosion in these materials can penetrate the seal quickly, allowing moisture to enter.

**Prevention of stone chipping issues:**
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized using design measures:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable components.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone-hitting risk, select part materials and paints that align in color to avoid visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid designing parts that feature edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements in lower areas of the vehicle, deepen them so they are less prone to being hit by stones.

### 3.5 Traceability
For part requirements, follow the specification outlined in VinFast Standard VFDST00010501.

### 3.6 Labeling of Parts
Suppliers must adhere to VinFast Standard VFDST00000010. Visual figures are necessary to illustrate label positioning on parts (set-up with pictures).

### 3.7 Vehicle Architecture
**Vehicle Architecture:**
All changes to parts and modules affecting vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence must be promptly communicated to VinFast for separate evaluation. The vehicle must fully conform to requirements outlined in the vehicle layout plans. The definition and technical geometric specifications for complete vehicle interior and exterior dimensions are derived from GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.

**Styling Technique Convergence:**
Suppliers must notify VinFast immediately of any changes to parts or modules that impact exterior and/or interior styling surfaces for separate evaluation.
</page>

<page number="14">
3.8 Operational Strength (Stiffness / Strength / Durability):
- Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions (operating loads and special events).
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile.
- Definition of all requirements to ensure sufficient operational strength of complete vehicle, subsystems, and components (this technical specification serves as the basis for all system and component technical specifications).
- Mounting force must be lower than dismounting force.

**Operating Loads:**
Operating loads are the loads that occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the benchmark base vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast. 
- The definition of customer usage is based on VinFast for MCE (mixed circuit Europe = long-distance durability run). 
- The tested mileage is based on the target of 160,000 km for desired vehicle usage. 
- Vehicle lifetime is defined as at least 10 years. 

**The environmental operating conditions are:**
- -30°C to +50°C ambient.
- 0 - 100% relative humidity.
- -100 m to 3500 m above mean sea level.

**Special Events:**
Special events occur infrequently (approx. less than 100 occurrences) within the scope of intended vehicle use (e.g., ABS braking).
- Vehicles must be designed so that special events do not compromise functionality, safety-relevant components, or service life.

**Misuse Events:**
Misuse events fall outside the intended vehicle use (e.g., kerbstone impact). 
The vehicle must be designed to ensure:
- Damages from misuse are clearly recognizable to the driver (e.g., steering wheel or wheel alignment issues).
- A defined damage hierarchy ensures replaceable parts fail before impacting the car's body structure.
</page>

<page number="15">
3.9 Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations. Either to the same or at neighboring components (principle "deformation before break"). Testing and validation and DVP&R.

DVP and PC test responsibility follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for System, Sub-system & Component Level inline with Complete Vehicle Specification book in the concept phase. Detailed test plan for hardware tests in file DVP&R and needs to work with the Testing & Validation department:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- No. of tested components/parts.
- For PPAP material data sheets (MDS) in IMDS according to IMDS Rules and Guidelines IMDS 001 and IMDS Recommendations 002-122 are required. Updates are required for changes.
- Material data sheets have to be provided by the supplier to VinFast IMDS-ID 214435.
- Ensure Mileage Target Life: 160000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first).

Refer to DVP:
- VFDSXVBEX0109
- VFDSXVBEX0109-DVP_COMPONENT_EXTERIOR TRIM WIPER SYSTEM.

3.9.1 Test plan.
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times.

For tests, the B2P SUP is contracted.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The B2P SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the B2P SUP site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VinFast/B2P SUP.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the cost of B2P SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned, and the retesting has to be paid by B2P SUP if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).

The B2P SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend at any testing at the B2P SUP site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast/B2P SUP.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts or different testing procedure, the testing has to be redone on the costs of B2P SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting has to be paid by B2P SUP if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- No. of tested components/parts.

The B2P SUP is responsible to use the draft DVP&R provided by VF testing department. The B2P SUP has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart) and serial stage. 

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. Upon request, the B2P SUP must use a test plan for each single component.

### 3.9.2 Test plan example
DVP has to be weekly updated into the following points by the supplier.

### 3.9.3 Testing
#### 3.9.3.1 General
The B2P SUP provides in time a detailed testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart. It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested. 

In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible. 

The Supplier has to download the VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC.
