General Description of the System / Component.

It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification are to be agreed between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.

The system developer commits to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process to achieve:
- The trim-specific requirements.
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of selling markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.

For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, weight, quality, and time schedule. The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of selling markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class B and C common platform. VINFAST will also monitor ongoing changes of rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.

The supplier delivers the trim parts as a module (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated). Add-on parts not included in the development range of the supplier are to be taken into consideration as purchase parts. Add-on parts include electrical components and COP parts.

For the documentation of the release, the following sheets and documents are necessary:
- Drawings.
- Simulations (e.g., mold flow analysis).
- Quality regulations.
- Results/documentation of test validation.
- Documentation of the FMEA.

All parts of the assembly must be matched to each other. Functional dimensions must be fulfilled according to the prescription.

Function.

Requirements.

The most important function of components:
- Covering of BIW and other systems according to styling requirements, considering targets of legal/market requirements.
- Noise absorption.
- Integration of add-on parts.
</page>

<page number="12">
- Providing full functionality over lifetime.

**Overall function**

Development targets:
- Prevention of functional and qualitative problems out of known systems.
- Use of standard and common parts if possible or reasonable.
- Process reliability at production, packaging, transport, and assembly.
- Minimize effort of overall production sequence: production, packaging, transport, and assembly on line.
- Prevention of displacement.
- Integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of the part package (Simultaneous Engineering) from the concept phase onward, including early inclusion of developers of neighboring components (body shell, finishers, etc.).
- General reduction of cost compared to predecessor models.
- Further improvement of acoustic, optical, and functional characteristics.
- Functionality has to be ensured within the temperature range -30°C (-5° for Vietnam market) till +85°C in areas above the beltline and -30° (-5° for Vietnam market) till +85°C in areas below the beltline.

**Stiffness / Rigidity / Stability of Shape**
- Especially in the area of the operating elements, the components and bracket design must ensure that no instability is noticeable.
- Irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, and visible waviness under climatic change loads are prohibited.

**Materials**
- Material and production-compliant design layout of the components for avoiding production-related surface flaws/defects (e.g., tool parting points/lines, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, stress zones, etc.).
- Material-compliant fits, curvatures, corners, ensuring visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces.
- Uniform and proportionally accurate material-compliant run-out of component edges, corners, and ribs.
- Selection of concepts and production methods that facilitate homogeneous and grain structures.
- Avoidance of visible screw points, screw point covers, or dummy covers. Surfaces are required to be free of burrs within the visual and haptic zone.
- No view of other parts is allowed (other components should not be recognizable through grilles, trim covers, indentations, joints, or cavities). A neat and tidy overall impression is mandatory.
- Ensuring correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts with regard to disturbance noise.
- Components must remain free of disturbing noise and odor in contact with the environment under all temperature and driving conditions.

### Surfaces and Quality Standards
- Surfaces have to be designed according to DINENISO 1302 [14].  
- Quality requirements at supplier from production material are due to "N85065" [40].  
- In order to coordinate the form and the surface, corresponding samples including Cubing reports and Appearance Approval reports must be presented. For these, suppliers must adhere to VFDST00038400 [12] (Color Matching/Appearance Approval) and VDA 280 part 1 [47].  
- Matching parts must be present from the supplier according to timing from matching department.  

### Variants
- Variants by different colors are possible as described in the VINFAST Feature List.  

### Interfaces
- The components must be designed to guarantee functionality in combination with adjoining systems while considering tolerances and thermal influences.  
- Interfaces should be developed by the system designer using quality methods like FMEA or a risk filter.  

### Air Ducts
- The cross-section of air ducts must be free of abrupt changes in section area and shape, which can increase friction losses and parasitic noise.  
- Sharp edges are critical for acoustics and flow resistance.  
- Changes transverse to the direction of flow, such as deflections, must be designed with the maximum possible radius.  
- Transitions between duct sections and vents must be smooth and tight on the air side.  
- Development must align with the VinFast Standard VFDST00048400.
