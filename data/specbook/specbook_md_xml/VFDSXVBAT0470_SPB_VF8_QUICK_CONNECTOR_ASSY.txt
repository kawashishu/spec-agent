# 6 Detailed Engineering Drawings of Components

The page features detailed engineering drawings and dimensions for the cooling adapter and components related to the quick connector assembly. Key views and measurements include:

1. **Detail Adapter:**
   - Isometric view of the quick connector showing item numbers for assembly parts.
   - Horizontal and cross-sectional dimensions of the adapter parts.

2. **Section A-A (Cooling Adapter):**
   - Vertical dimensions with radius values for specific contours.

3. **Detail B (S51):**
   - Fine measurements indicating angles, flat areas, and specific groove diameters.

4. **Detail C (S51):**
   - Close-up cross-sectional measurements including material compatibility standards.

5. **Detail Part Scales:**
   - Separate scale diagrams providing precision measurements for distinct parts (scale options provided for parts 2, 3, and 4).

6. **Section G-G (Scale 11):**
   - Geometrical analysis showing alignment points for the part.

7. **Dust Cap:**
   - Assembly direction of the dust cap marked with arrows and dimension indications for proper placement.

These views and dimensions ensure precise manufacturing and compatibility for use within cooling systems in battery modules.
