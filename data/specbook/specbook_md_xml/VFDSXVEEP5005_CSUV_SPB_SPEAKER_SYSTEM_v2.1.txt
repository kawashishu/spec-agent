5.3.1 Overview Functions Description.
The speaker system is an entertainment unit in the infotainment system. It helps customers have a good experience in the car when listening to music, watching movies, playing radio, or making Bluetooth calls. Converting electrical energy into sound energy is used to amplify the sound of multimedia. The speaker system shall reproduce input signals on each channel according to specifications and split input audio signals into low, mid, and high ranges for the appropriate speakers.

There are three variants of the speaker system for the C-Premium car: Base, Mid, and High.

b. Test report(s) and Certificate(s).  
The supplier is responsible for getting their part(s), product(s) or system(s) to meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale.  

VinFast requests the Supplier to conduct tests as specified in certain of the UN-ECE at authorized technical service(s). The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  

VinFast also requests that the Supplier provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings to be submitted to the relevant authorities in order to get certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any).  

The Supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with an UN-ECE regulation.  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an UN-ECE regulation, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.

The Supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
