**Additional Notes:**
Wheel arch finishers are part of the exterior trim and ornamentation for VF7 (VFe34S).  
They are mainly mounted on the front fender (at front) and body side outer (at rear) of the vehicle (LH & RH) and have an interference fit with these BIW parts.  

The parts are grained plastics (PP+EPDM-TD20).  

The component should be capable of performing under all conditions. The dimensions should remain stable and should have no color or gloss change and not display any detrimental effects when exposed to extreme conditions (-40°C to +120°C).  

For detailed reference, consult the "Color and Trim Brochure – VFDSXNCVC2801 – VFe34S (VF7)_Appendix_8_Color and Material_Exterior."
