11.1 In Process Testing.

In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuing improvement. Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan. When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked.

The table that follows summarizes the various IP tests and the acceptance parameters for each. They form the basis on which to develop a complete Control Plan for these and their related significant process characteristics. The Control Plan will include frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.

11 Production quality.

11.3 Dimensional Control.
The production supplier has ultimate responsibility to write the Control Plan and to identify significant characteristics (SC) over and above the significant and critical features identified by VinFast. The production supplier is also responsible to establish initial Process Control and ongoing process capability reporting per VinFast requirements. The Control Plan will identify those features requiring process capability. Process capability must be established from 30 pieces randomly selected from a continuous production run of at least 300 pieces. The process capability must meet AIAG PPAP edition 4. Capability data is to be included in the PPAP documentation.

When process capability has been demonstrated, X bar and R charts must be used for ongoing control of characteristics identified in the Control Plan unless specifically waived by VinFast ATI1. Acceptance of parts by any sampling plan or statistical process control procedure does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility that each part meets all requirements of the purchase order and the components print. If any defects are found during implementation of the in-process sampling plan, the supplier must invoke the reaction plan program specified in the Control Plan.

Individual VinFast ATI1 departmental requirements for acceptability of process capability numbers (Cp, Cpk, etc.) may supersede any general guidelines at any time.

A documented fail-safe system must be established by the supplier, approved by VinFast, and be in place at all forging, heat treating, machining, and final assembly facilities/operations to ensure that any non-compliance front knuckles are removed permanently from the product flow.

11.4 X-RAY Inspection for Porosity, Voids, & Cracks (Applicable only for Casting).

1. X-ray testing for internal discontinuities must be performed after casting as identified in the process control plan. During the PV and IP-I stages, the supplier is responsible for developing specific acceptance standards for all critical areas susceptible to internal discontinuities (porosity, shrink, inclusions, etc.). These locations and standards must be approved by VinFast ATI1, consistent with ASTM E155 & E505 references and standards and referenced in production control plans.

2. Operators must receive appropriate training in interpreting potential flaws with the particular equipment chosen for the production x-ray inspection procedures in accordance with EN 473 (General principles for qualification and certification of NDT personnel) or ISO 9712 (Non-destructive testing - Qualification and certification of personnel). Evidence of this training shall be held on file for inspection by VinFast STA / ATI1.

3. Test equipment must be capable of detecting discontinuities greater than or equal to ASTM E155 & E505 Plate 1 in defined critical areas. Film or real-time x-ray may be used provided that the system has proven capability to resolve defects of the minimum standard detailed above.

4. The x-ray inspection equipment must have the capability to allow the inspector to manually inspect any/all areas of the component as deemed necessary. Automatic defect recognition systems may be used after proving capability to resolve defects during the ‘run at rate trial’ on the applicable component with the same efficacy as a trained inspector.

<page number="20">
11.5 Fluorescent Dye Penetrant for Surface Defects (Casting/Forging) (crack check).  
1. A fluorescent dye penetrant test for cracks and surface discontinuities will be performed on all exterior part surfaces, per ASTM E165 (method A) and ASTM E433.  
2. Operators must receive appropriate training in interpreting potential flaws with the particular equipment chosen for the production dye penetrant inspection procedures in accordance with EN 473 (General principles for qualification and certification of NDT personnel) or ISO 9712 (Non-destructive testing - Qualification and certification of personnel). Evidence of this training shall be held on file for inspection by VinFast STA / ATI1.  
3. Specified defects may be checked for severity by grinding removal if the following conditions are met:  
   a) The removal method must be proven not to mask the defect to the fluorescent dye penetrant detection.  
   b) The depth of removal must not create any stress raisers or thin out any wall thickness below the as-cast print specified minimum. The surface finishes after any material removal must be fine enough such that no notches are created which could initiate fatigue cracks (this is defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1mm and/or root radius less than or equal to 5mm).  
   c) The depth of removal must not violate the part print tolerances.  
4. If any defects in excess of the maximum allowable values and/or acceptance standards are found, refer to the reaction plan within the Process Control Plan.  
5. All parts inspected during IP-II phase must be shown to be free from defects, for a period of 90 days in order that this requirement is revoked. Otherwise, dye penetrant inspection shall continue until ATI1 / STA is satisfied that this process is no longer necessary.  

11.6 Feature Removal Standards & Surface Finish (Castings/Forging)  
1. The maximum allowable flash will be no greater than 0.5 mm; a chamfer allowance of 2 mm (max) is acceptable to accommodate this requirement. The use of controlled grinding operations on the part is approved for flash and sharp edge removal in order to ensure safe part handling. In any areas where flash or other defects are removed, the minimum wall thickness detailed on the part model must be maintained. In addition, the surface finish after any material removal must be fine enough so that no notches are present which could initiate fatigue cracks (this is defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1mm and/or a root radius less than or equal to 5mm).  
2. In general, the removal of any material from a part must not compromise the part function. As-cast surface roughness shall be less than or equal to cast surface Rz < 50, web & fettled areas Rz < 50. Equivalent specification to be followed for forged surfaces.

11.8 Mechanical Properties (Casting/Forging).

1. The mechanical properties shall be checked per ASTM B108 and B557 procedures or applicable ASTM standards for forgings.
2. For batch furnace heat treat lots only, two (2) test bars from each three (3) pairs (12 in total) of components per heat treat lot (after heat treat operation) shall be taken from identified areas from the component (Figure 11.4) and checked as a minimum requirement. Once sufficient data has been collected to show adequately reproducible mechanical properties throughout the heat treat lot, and with agreement of VinFast ATI1/STA, the sample size will be reduced to two (2) test bars from one (1) pair (4 in total) per heat treat lot.
3. All tensile bar sizes and types should conform to BS-EN 10002-1. To ensure consistent testing, it is required that the testing be performed with 6mm gauge diameter test specimens. All other sample dimensions are to be derived from the BS-EN standard.
4. In addition to meeting all ASTM B108 requirements, the following individual strength criteria must be met in the tensile specimens designated in Sections M.2:
   - Minimum Tensile Strength (MPa)
   - Minimum Yield Strength (MPa)
   - Minimum Elongation

   **Refer to 3.4 Material Requirement.**

5. If minimum requirements are not met, refer to the reaction plan contained within the VinFast Product Development approved Control Plan.
