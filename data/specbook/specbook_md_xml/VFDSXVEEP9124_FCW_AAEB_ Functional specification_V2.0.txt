### 7.4.2 / FCW Function FCW

Requirement ID: FS-226343  
Type: Information  
Status: New  

FCW function provides a visual and sound warning to the driver when there is an imminent collision. The intention is to remind the driver to take over and brake or to take proper action immediately to avoid AEB intervention or collision.

Except activated/deactivated switches, there are sensitivity switches for FCW. Driver can select “Late,” “Normal,” or “Early.” As the name suggests, compared with “Late,” if “Early” was selected by the driver, the AEB function will send a warning earlier when critical conditions occur.

FCW can only be active when the host vehicle speed is within the range for different objects.  

### Target Speed Ranges

- **Moving Vehicles:**  
  Minimum Host Vehicle Speed - 5kph  
  Maximum Host Vehicle Speed - 130kph  

- **Stationary Vehicles:**  
  Minimum Host Vehicle Speed - 5kph  
  Maximum Host Vehicle Speed - 80kph  

- **Moving VRU:**  
  Minimum Host Vehicle Speed - 5kph  
  Maximum Host Vehicle Speed - 80kph  

- **Stationary or Crossing VRU:**  
  Minimum Host Vehicle Speed - 5kph  
  Maximum Host Vehicle Speed - 80kph  

- **Moving Motorbike:**  
  Minimum Host Vehicle Speed - 5kph  
  Maximum Host Vehicle Speed - 80kph  

- **Stationary Motorbike:**  
  Minimum Host Vehicle Speed - 5kph

Type: Information  
Status: New  

If an imminent collision is predicted, Autonomous Emergency Braking is applied to avoid the collision or mitigate its consequence.  

Relative Speed TTC Table:  
The table provides tuneable parameters as examples to configure the relative speed thresholds for Forward Collision Warning (FCW). The thresholds are divided based on three sensitivity settings: Early, Normal, and Late.

- **For VRel (m/s)**:
  - At 0.833 m/s, TTC thresholds are 1.3 seconds (Early), 1.1 seconds (Normal), and 0.9 seconds (Late).
  - At 2.5 m/s, TTC thresholds are 1.34 seconds (Early), 1.14 seconds (Normal), and 0.94 seconds (Late).
  - At 5.56 m/s, TTC thresholds increase to 1.63 seconds (Early), 1.43 seconds (Normal), and 1.23 seconds (Late).
  - As speeds increment gradually to 50 m/s, TTC thresholds stabilize at approximately 2.51 seconds (Early), 2.31 seconds (Normal), and 2.11 seconds (Late).  

### FCW Warning Levels Based on TTC Threshold
- **Level 1**: Triggered when TTC is below the FCW threshold.  
- **Level 2**: Triggered when TTC meets the Prefill threshold condition (advanced warning).  
- **Level 3**: Triggered simultaneously with AEB/EBA activation, indicating the ADAS system's intervention in critical scenarios.

7.4.2 / / FCW Function FCW

Requirement ID: FS-226343  
Type: Information  
Status: New  

FCW function provides visual and auditory warnings to the driver when there is an imminent collision. Its purpose is to prompt the driver to take over control, brake, or act immediately to avoid AEB intervention or collision.

Drivers can adjust FCW sensitivity switches to select "Late," "Normal," or "Early." If "Early" is selected, a warning will be issued earlier under critical conditions compared to "Late."

FCW can only activate if the host vehicle speed is within the target speed range for different objects:

- **Moving Vehicles**: Minimum speed is 5kph, and maximum speed is 130kph.  
- **Stationary Vehicles**: Minimum speed is 5kph, and maximum speed is 80kph.  
- **Moving VRU**: Minimum speed is 5kph, and maximum speed is 80kph.  
- **Stationary or Crossing VRU**: Minimum speed is 5kph, and maximum speed is 80kph.  
- **Moving Motorbike**: Minimum speed is 5kph, and maximum speed is 80kph.  
- **Stationary Motorbike**: Minimum speed is 5kph, and maximum speed is 80kph.

7.4.3 / / AEB Function AEB

Requirement ID: FS-226344  
Type: Information  
Status: New  

Autonomous Emergency Braking applies braking to avoid a predicted collision or reduce its severity. The AEB system is capable of requesting deceleration up to 9 m/s² based on object threat, vehicle dynamics, and speed reduction objectives.

Braking may be interrupted or canceled if:
- Detected objects change.
- The driver presses the gas pedal or steers sharply to evade.

Prior to full braking, pre-fill is applied. This slightly contacts brake pads with rotors to enable quicker response to AEB activation.

The AEB system predicts and validates target trajectories based on environment data (targets and lanes) and vehicle dynamics. It triggers warnings or braking for critical objects.

If the host vehicle stops due to AEB, the system will hold the vehicle stationary for 2 seconds for collision prevention, maintaining deceleration flags and setpoints.

AEB activation depends on host vehicle speed being within the target speed range:

- **Moving Vehicles**: Minimum speed is 5kph, and maximum speed is 130kph.

7.4.3 / / AEB Function AEB

Requirement ID: FS-226344  
Type: Information  
Status: New  

If an imminent collision is predicted, Autonomous Emergency Braking is applied to avoid the collision or mitigate its consequence.  

The AEB system has the capability to request up to 9 m/s² deceleration by calculating the threat of the detected object, host vehicle dynamics, and speed reduction objective. The brake request may be interrupted and canceled if the detected objects change or the driver presses the gas pedal or sharply steers for an escape maneuver. 

Before the full amount of braking is applied, a short period of pre-fill braking will be initiated to allow the brake pads slight contact with the brake disc rotors, enabling a quicker response for Automatic Emergency Braking. The AEB system combines environmental information (targets and lane data) from the perception system and vehicle dynamic data to predict, monitor, and arbitrate the trajectory of the target and ego vehicle, triggering warnings or braking only for valid and critical objects. 

When the host vehicle decelerates to a stop due to the AEB function, the system holds the vehicle in standstill for 2 seconds to prevent further collision. During this period, the deceleration flag and setpoint are maintained. AEB will activate only when the host vehicle (real) speed falls within the range for different target objects.

**Table: Target Type and Host Vehicle Speed Range**  
- Moving Vehicles: Min Host Vehicle Speed = 5 kph, Max Host Vehicle Speed = 130 kph.  
- Stationary Vehicles: Min Host Vehicle Speed = 5 kph, Max Host Vehicle Speed = 80 kph.  
- Moving VRU: Min Host Vehicle Speed = 5 kph, Max Host Vehicle Speed = 80 kph.  
- Stationary or Crossing VRU: Min Host Vehicle Speed = 5 kph, Max Host Vehicle Speed = 80 kph.  
- Moving Motorbike: Min Host Vehicle Speed = 5 kph, Max Host Vehicle Speed = 80 kph.  
- Stationary Motorbike: Min Host Vehicle Speed = 5 kph, Max Host Vehicle Speed = 80 kph.  

Note: The parameter values in the table are default calibrated values and will be finalized based on test performance.  

**AEB TTC Threshold Team Table**  
The Relative Speed TTC table specifies tuneable parameters as an example:  

| VRel (m/s) | TTC |
|------------|-----|
| 0.833      | 1.1 |

7.4.5 / / EBA Function EBA

Requirement ID: FS-226346  
Type: Information  
Status: New  

Emergency Brake Assist (EBA) aims to enhance the brake efficiency when the driver actively applies the brakes in emergency situations to avoid collision. ADAS system detects the emergency brake condition based on the master cylinder pressure and driver input behavior, then provides assistance through ESC.

<page number="14">
7.4.4 Hydraulic Brake Assist (HBA) Function.

Requirement ID: FS-226345.  
Type: Information.  
Status: New.  

Hydraulic Brake Assist intends to provide a larger braking deceleration by building pressure actively when the driver presses the braking pedal under a collision situation. The ADAS system will send out a flag to the ESC according to the critical level, and the ESC shall create extra brake pressure besides the driver's input.  

There are three levels of HBA output values, which are related to different master cylinder pressure rates of ESP.  

The following requests correspond to three different risk levels:  
- When the FCW function is triggered, the ADAS system sends an HBA Level 1 request to the ESP simultaneously.  
- When the TTC meets the HBA threshold condition, the ADAS system requests ESP HBA Level 2.  
- When the AEB/EBA function is triggered, the ADAS system sends an HBA Level 3 request to the ESP simultaneously.  

The HBA TTC threshold is shown below (tuneable parameter, only as an example):

7.4.5 Emergency Brake Assist (EBA) Function.

Requirement ID: FS-226346.  
Type: Information.  
Status: New.  

The AEB function is designed to prevent or mitigate collisions when the driver takes no action. However, when the driver applies braking but insufficient force, the system amplifies the deceleration to avoid the collision. This is known as Emergency Brake Assist (EBA).  

EBA can only be active when the host vehicle (real) speed is within the range for different targets:  

### Target Type Speed Range:

- **Moving Vehicles:**  
  - Min Host Vehicle Speed: 5kph.  
  - Max Host Vehicle Speed: 130kph.  

- **Stationary Vehicles:**  
  - Min Host Vehicle Speed: 5kph.  
  - Max Host Vehicle Speed: 80kph.  

- **Moving VRU:**  
  - Min Host Vehicle Speed: 5kph.  
  - Max Host Vehicle Speed: 80kph.  

- **Stationary or Crossing VRU:**

7.4.4 Hydraulic Brake Assist (HBA) Function.

Requirement ID: FS-226345.  
Type: Information.  
Status: New.  

Hydraulic Brake Assist (HBA) provides increased braking deceleration by building pressure actively when the driver presses the brake pedal during a collision situation. The ADAS system sends a flag to the ESC based on the critical level, enabling the ESC to create extra brake pressure beyond the driver's input.  

HBA consists of 3 output levels related to different master cylinder pressure rates of the ESP system. These levels correlate to various risk levels:  
- When the FCW function is triggered, the ADAS system sends an HBA Level 1 request to the ESP.  
- When TTC meets the HBA threshold condition, the ADAS system requests ESP HBA Level 2.  
- When AEB/EBA is triggered, the ADAS system sends an HBA Level 3 request to the ESP.  

HBA TTC threshold is detailed in the table below. The values are tuneable and for example purposes only.

7.4.6 Junction Assist (JA) Function.

Requirement ID: FS-226347.  
Type: Information.  
Status: New.

Junction Assist (JA) is an extended function of AEB enabled by Camera and Radar sensor technologies. It assists drivers in avoiding accidents at road junction crossings.  

JA detects potential collisions when the host vehicle is turning, and the target is moving straight, autonomously applying brakes. It supports scenarios such as:
- Ego left-turning (Left-Hand Driving) colliding with an oncoming straight-moving vehicle.  
- Ego turning left/right, colliding with a VRU crossing straight.  
- Ego moving straight, colliding with a crossing vehicle.  

JA is active only when the host vehicle’s speed is within the defined range for various objects.

7.4.6 / / JA Function JA.

Requirement ID: FS-226347.  
Type: Information.  
Status: New.  

With the development of Camera and Radar sensor detection technology, AEB could be realized in more complex traffic situations. Junction Assist is the extended function which helps drivers avoid accidents, especially in junction crossing roads.  

When the host vehicle is turning, and the target is moving straight, JA can realize the potential collision and brake autonomously.  

The JA is applicable for the scenario of ego left turning (in case of Left-Hand Driving) may strike with an oncoming car that is straight moving, ego turning left/right strike with VRU straight crossing, or ego straight moving strike with a crossing car.  

JA could be active only when the host vehicle (real) speed is within the range for different objects.

**Host Vehicle Speed for JA:**  
- Target Type: Vehicles. Min Host Vehicle Speed: **5kph**. Max Host Vehicle Speed: **28kph**.  
- Target Type: VRU. Min Host Vehicle Speed: **7kph**. Max Host Vehicle Speed: **28kph**.  
- Target Type: Motorbike. Min Host Vehicle Speed: **7kph**. Max Host Vehicle Speed: **28kph**.  

**Target Speed Range for JA:**  
- Target Type: Vehicles. Min Target Speed: **0kph**. Max Target Speed: **55kph**.  
- Target Type: VRU. Min Target Speed: **0kph**. Max Target Speed: **20kph**.  
- Target Type: Motorbike. Min Target Speed: **0kph**. Max Target Speed: **60kph**.

Requirement ID: FS-226409  
Type: Functional  
Status: reopen  

The FCW and AEB function shall be automatically reinstated at the initiation of each new ignition cycle. The driver can activate or deactivate FCW and AEB functions via the HMI and select the sensitivity of FCW during the driving cycle.

After system power-on:
- FCW is turned on by default. The default sensitivity is Normal. The system should always send the signals:
  * ADAS_FCW_Mode_Feed = 0x1:ON  
  * FCW_sens_Feed = 0x1:Normal  

- AEB is turned on by default. The system should always send the signal:  
  * ADAS_FCW_Mode_Feed = 0x1:ON  

When the power mode is ON (STAT_CL_15_1_L = 0x1:ON):
- If the system receives MHU_FCW_Mode = 0x1:ON continuously for 3 frames, it considers the FCW function switch is turned ON. The system should send the signal:  
  * ADAS_FCW_Mode_Feed = 0x1:ON continuously  

- If the system receives MHU_AEB_Mode = 0x1:ON continuously for 3 frames, it considers the AEB function switch is turned ON. The system should send the signal:  
  * ADAS_AEB_Mode_Feed = 0x1:ON continuously  

When the power mode is ON (STAT_CL_15_1_L = 0x1:ON) and the display speed (MHU_DigitSpeed) < calibration (default: 10 km/h):
- If the system receives MHU_FCW_Mode = 0x0:OFF continuously for 3 frames, it considers the FCW function switch is turned OFF. The system should send the signal:  
  * ADAS_FCW_Mode_Feed = 0x0:OFF continuously  

- If the system receives MHU_AEB_Mode = 0x0:OFF continuously for 3 frames, it considers the AEB function switch is turned OFF. The system should send the signal:  
  * ADAS_AEB_Mode_Feed = 0x0:OFF continuously  

HMI Signal Settings:
- HMI sends the signal MHU_FCW_sens = 0x0:Early / 0x1:Normal / 0x2:Late for three frames. The system should continuously send ADAS_FCW_Sens_Feed = 0x0:Early / 0x1:Normal / 0x2:Late as the feedback value.
