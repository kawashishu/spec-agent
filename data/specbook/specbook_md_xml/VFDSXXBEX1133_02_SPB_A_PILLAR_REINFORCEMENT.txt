3.7.1 Test plan.  
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times.  

For tests, the B2P SUP is contracted.  

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.  

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.  

The B2P SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend at any testing at the B2P SUP site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast/B2P SUP.  

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the costs of the B2P SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned, and the retesting has to be paid by B2P SUP if they are responsible for the failure.  

Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:  
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.  
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).  
- Responsible test department.  
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).  
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).  
- Part variant, description of part.

The VF test engineer must be informed within 2 working days in the event of negative test results. The VF test engineer must also be updated periodically regarding the actual status and progress.

If VinFast orders parts for testing independently, a detailed description of the parts must be attached.

#### 3.7.6 Archival storage of tested parts
Testing parts may only be scrapped if the VinFast test department agrees. Upon the request of the test engineer, the full testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.

#### 3.7.7 Virtual testing

3.7 Testing and validation and DVP&R.

3.7.8 Component testing.
The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VF, VinFast, and the B2P SUP, and will be binding.

3.7.9 Mechanical integration tests.
The following tests will be performed as mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle:  
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100).  
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800).  
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000).  
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600).  

It is essential that no distortion or functional disturbance occurs across the entire functional temperature range according to VTS. Materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients must maintain stable behavior.  
The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.  
If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts must be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at the VinFast test department must be provided by the B2P SUP free of charge.

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.
Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 and includes the quantity of parts and timings.  
For each step of the process, suppliers are responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design per the agreed timing to achieve OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  
The process begins in the early PT build phase to secure AAR Approval at LS.  
Suppliers must include this activity in their development process and ED&D costs.
