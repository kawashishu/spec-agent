## 5.3 Material requirement & Corrosion

Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

### Corrosion Requirements Classification:
1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity.

### Material Combination Guidelines:
- Choose materials to prevent galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and attached brackets. Apply proper coating such as paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers if necessary.  
- Avoid accumulation of water and dirt, and provide drainage at the lowest positions.
- Prevent dirt traps where sand can act as an abrasive and damage the painted body through micro movements.
- Ensure that contact surfaces with the body remain dry, sufficiently large for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement at these surfaces.
- Ensure edge coverage using burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

### Corrosion Tests:
- The parts must pass system/component tests and a complete vehicle corrosion test.

#### **Component test for Metallic Surfaces:**
- **Salt Spray Test:** ISO9227, acceptance criteria detailed below.

#### **Organic Coatings Testing:**
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria detailed below.
</page>

<page number="9">
Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test Criteria:
#### Area: Interior, mounted parts, dry area  
- **Corrosivity:** Low  
- **Metallic coatings:** 240 h NSS (ISO 9227)  
- **Organic coatings:** 96 h (ISO 6270 CH)  
- **Pass criteria:** No red rust  

#### Area: Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, wet area  
- **Corrosivity:** Medium  
- **Metallic coatings:** 480 h NSS (ISO 9227)  
- **Organic coatings:** 5 cycles CCT (ISO 11997 Cycle B)  
- **Pass criteria:** 
  - NSS: No red rust  
  - CCT: See below  

#### Area: High/not visible for customer  
- **Corrosivity:** High  
- **Metallic coatings:** 480 h NSS (ISO 9227)  
- **Organic coatings:** 10 cycles CCT (ISO 11997 Cycle B)  

#### Area: High/visible, very high

- **Metallic coatings:** 720 h NSS (ISO 9227)  
- **Organic coatings:** 
  - 10 cycles CCT (ISO 11997 Cycle B)  
  - Includes stone-chipping protection where needed   

---

### Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT testing:
- **Rust creep according to ISO 4628-8:**  
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm  

- **Blistering:**  
  - Blister size maximum S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2)  

- **Edge corrosion:**  
  - ≤ 10%  

- **Weld seam corrosion:**  
  - ≤ 5%  

- **Degree of rusting:**  
  - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO 4628-3)  

---

### Stainless Steel Requirements:
Avoid direct contact with other metals (to prevent galvanic corrosion). In most cases, an insulating coating is required.
</page>

<page number="10">
Test criteria for high visible parts: 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Areas with crevices must be especially checked. Component tests should be executed with the assembled sub-system, where possible, in its installed position on the vehicle.

**Aluminium parts:**  
Aluminium parts in high visible areas must be painted or anodized.  
- Test criteria for Painted Aluminium: follow test criteria for organic coatings.  
- Test criteria for Anodized Aluminium: 480 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.  
Component tests must be conducted with assembled sub-systems, where possible, in their installed position on the vehicle.

**Chromed metal parts:**  
240 h NSS ISO 9227 without base material corrosion.

**Chromed plastic parts:**  
CASS-Test according to DIN EN ISO 9227; duration:  
- 48 h for Exterior  
- 24 h for Interior  
- Acceptance criteria: no surface defects.  
Additional criteria: 240 h NSS ISO 9227 without surface defects.

**Electric parts:**  
Electrically functional units enclosed in casings and boxes must include a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex), especially in wet locations. Material choices must prevent galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and attached brackets. Direct contact with noble metals (steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel) and conductive/anti-static rubber should be avoided in wet environments.  

Steel fasteners must be treated to ensure long-term corrosion resistance and compatibility with other materials. Electrical components must be installed to prevent fretting corrosion caused by vibrations.  
Terminals and connectors should not be placed at the lowest points. Tightness and corrosion protection of terminals are critical to keeping electrical connections safe from humidity.  
Grounding surfaces must be water-tight when placed in corrosive environments.  

**Aluminium/sealing surfaces:**  
Aluminium alloys containing copper and iron content greater than 1% should not be used for sealing surfaces due to their high susceptibility to corrosion. Corrosion easily penetrates seals, increasing vulnerability to moisture intrusion.

<page number="11">
Prevention of stone chipping issues:
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone hitting risk, choose part materials and paint with the same colour to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them so they cannot be hit easily by stones.

Traceability:
For part requirements, follow specifications and refer to VinFast standards VFDST00010502 and VFDST00010501.

Labeling of Parts:
Suppliers must adhere to VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Figures must be created to indicate position labels on parts (position labels set up with pictures).

Vehicle Architecture:
The complete vehicle must pass the requirements from the vehicle layout plans. All changes to parts and modules affecting the vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence of the vehicle must be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation. The definition and technical geometric specification regarding complete vehicle dimensions in interior and exterior are based on GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.

Styling Technique Convergence:
All changes to parts and modules affecting the exterior and/or interior styling surfaces of the vehicle must be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation. Part or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops must be provided by the supplier (e.g., tooling demands, assembly sequence), based on defined requirements from VinFast module leads. Technical input can be provided in office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.

7. Homologation and safety regulations.

Safety is one of the key issues in the development and integration of automotive functionalities.

7.1 Homologation and safety regulation requirements.

### 7.1.1 North America.
**Homologation and safety regulation activities.**  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., European Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.  

**Self-certification and test report(s).**  
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s) or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain of the FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  
(*) Refer Appendix 8 of Manufacturer_Handbook.

**Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations.**  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

### 7.1.2 Europe.
**Homologation and safety regulation activities.**  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.  

**Test report(s) and certificate(s).**  
The supplier is responsible for ensuring their part(s), product(s) or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers conduct tests as specified in certain of the UN-ECE at authorized technical services. The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
VinFast also requests suppliers to provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings, to be submitted to the relevant authorities in order to get certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any).  
The supplier should be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.  

**Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations.**  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
