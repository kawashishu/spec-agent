Requirements:

During the stiffness- and rigidity testing there must not be any permanent deformations, no breakage, and no customer-relevant modifications.

Most important functions of the Cockpit:
- Optical trim.
- Absorption of noises.
- Absorbing properties in case of head-impact.
- Integration of add-on parts.
- Fulfill all functions over a lifetime.

Crosscarbeam IP:
- The crosscar beam (CCB) should be used as the main fixation of the IP.
- Master Reference Point between IP main carrier and CCB in Y=0.
- Input about the kind of fixation and stiffness defined from SDS IP.
- Technical CCB specifications are defined in the spec book CCB.

Airbag Door:
The airbag door contains an invisible breakup solution. The lid-carrier is horizontally divided, if possible symmetrical. If the supplier believes another airbag door solution fulfills the requirements better, the supplier has the responsibility to inform, present, and discuss the concept with VinFast.

- The split line must be invisible on the dashboard skin (A-surface).
- The hinge lines must not show marks on the skin.
- All break lines of the airbag door must be invisible and can be made by cutting with a cold knife or by a laser.
- The airbag door must be tested at all temperatures (+20°C room temperature, -30°C low temperature, +85°C high temperature) and with all generator loads (Minimum/Nominal/Maximum load). The tolerance for all testing temperatures is ±2.5°C.
- VinFast proposes adding an airbag shooting channel on the backside of the IP, through vibration welding, ultrasonic welding, or infrared welding. Injection molding with an integrated shooting channel is also possible if no split line is visible on the A-surface of the dashboard and all requirements are fulfilled.

The development target is to avoid a separate door for the passenger airbag. The integrated airbag door must be firmly attached to the dashboard to avoid tearing off risks.

No risk of injuries:
- No injuries to occupants caused by the instrument panel or airbag door during and after deployment (collision or secondary collision) have to be assured.

Opening force of the airbag door:
- The opening force of the airbag door must be agreed upon with the airbag supplier and specified in the production drawing. As a general rule, the maximum opening force should be less than 2.3 kN.
- For the testing program of the airbag door, refer to the safety and restraint system specification. The validation program for all development phases is provided in the appendix of the subsystem technical specification for safety and restraint systems.

  - Edge corrosion: ≤ 10%
  - Weld seam corrosion: ≤ 5%
  - Degree of rusting: ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO 4628-3)

General interior corrosion considerations:

- The interior is generally considered a dry area with low corrosivity. Exceptions include floor areas where wetness, abrasion by shoes, or exposure to juices might induce corrosion.
- When combining different metals, galvanic corrosion must be prevented by coating the parts appropriately.
- Edges, especially painted edges, must be burr-free to ensure good edge coverage and avoid wear.
- **Seat structure (uncoated/blank steel):** Newly manufactured parts must be corrosion-free, and areas at risk of corrosion must not be visible to the customer. Extreme positions of seat-rests should be taken into account.

Invisible area corrosion requirements:

- Test criteria for invisible areas may be lower, provided corrosive products do not appear in visible locations. Full functionality over the product's lifetime must still be guaranteed.

Vehicle tooling:

- Considered low-corrosivity exposure when stored in the trunk.
- Tool surfaces subject to wear might have medium corrosivity requirements.

An RPS concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE process. The RPS determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS system and VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28], according to interior and BIW department.

#### Tolerance Analyses
Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems, including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms
- Thermal expansion has to be considered

### Interfaces
The components must be designed such that the function is guaranteed in combination with the adjoining systems. 

The interfaces must be worked out in cooperation with VinFast in consideration of a quality method (e.g., FMEA, risk filter).
