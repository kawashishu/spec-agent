2.1 Development Scope Abstract.
This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the Wireless Charger. The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics. The Contractor ensures that the development of the components respect all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements. Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details have to be reported immediately. The contractor is a ‘System Development Supplier’ with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

2.2 Initial Situation and Objective.
The Wireless Charger provides charging voltage for any Qi standard certified mobile device. The system is planned for use in various vehicle models, for various country-specific packages, and for various combinations of optional equipment. Adaptation of system functions to a given vehicle shall be accomplished by modular component population of the necessary modules and coding via the diagnostics interface. The design of the WLC shall avoid noise generation like squeak and rattle as well as noise generation due to the moving parts. Furthermore, the electronic shall be designed to work without a fan or external cooling under the required temperature conditions.

2.3 Classification of the System / Component.
There is only one WLC variant.

2.4 Execution Regulations.
Not applicable.

2.5 Development and Supply Scope.

  - **Signals**: WLC sends LIN signal `Transmit_WLC_situation` (0x35) to inform its current status:  
    - 0x00 "Power OFF".  
    - 0x02 "Charging".  
    - 0x03 "Charging Complete".  

- **Setting ON/OFF Function**:  
  - MHU sends signal ON/OFF to BCM via CAN, which then relays the signal to WLC using LIN (0x31) to set its state (ON/OFF).  

- **Reminder User in Case Phone Forgotten in Car**:  
  - **Process**: When IGN goes from ON to OFF, and a phone remains on the PAD after the driver or assistant door is opened, WLC sends LIN signal (0x35) with logic 0x01 to notify the phone.  
  - **Note**: For specific smartphone models (e.g., iPhone), the system cannot reliably notify regarding forgotten phones due to smartphone-specific characteristics. This functionality is implemented but may not display on the center screen to avoid user confusion.

The WLC software supports the following functions via LIN signals, facilitated through BCM:  
- Charging functionality/status displayed on the center display.  
  - Charging starts when IGN is ON and all doors are closed, provided a phone is on the pad. Charging stops if a door is opened and resumes when doors are closed again.  
  - LIN signal informs WLC status: 0x00 for "Power OFF," 0x02 for "Charging," and 0x03 for "Charging complete."  
- ON/OFF settings enabled via signals sent to BCM, which forwards LIN command 0x31 to toggle WLC state.  
- Forgotten phone reminders are triggered when IGN switches from ON to OFF, and WLC sends LIN signal 0x35 with logic 0x01, notifying phone presence on the pad.  
  - Note: Due to smartphone-specific performance issues (e.g., iPhones), reminders may be inconsistent and are not displayed on the vehicle’s central display.  

5.5.2.1 Foreign object detection (FOD).  
- Large coins or metallic objects located at the center of the WLC pad interfere with charging. WLC sends an error signal (0x37 with logic 0x01) and resumes operation upon removal (logic 0x00 clears the error).  
- FOD detection adheres to Qi standards and works only with objects larger than 26mm placed centrally between charging coils.  

5.5.2.2 SMK(BCM) unit LF frequency interference prevention.  
- LIN command 0x30 prevents conflicts between the wireless charging frequency and SMK LF frequency band. Wireless charging halts in SMK LF mode and resumes upon LF mode completion.  

5.5.2.3 Error reporting via LIN signals (managed by BCM).  
Reported errors include:  
- Internal IC faults.  
- Fan malfunctions.  
- Temperature sensor errors (e.g., disconnection condition).

Page 32
The dismantling scheme describes the requirements to the contractor in terms of a simple, unmixed dismantling of the component as well as its accessibility when assembled. Dismantling scheme has to be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### Recycling scheme
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling scheme has to be provided to environmental experts team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### Pyrotechnic initiator neutralization
To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks/check of deployment per component).
- After deployment of the pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that shall be classified as toxic waste or hazardous substances, according to the status of the respectively valid waste legislation. Otherwise, the components shall be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances. 
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle/via feedback at the deployment tool). 
- Marking of positions of pyrotechnical components (especially “hidden” components, e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest). 
- In case of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is required. In this case, pre-dismantling, if technically possible, shall be avoided (accessibility of fasteners).

### 5.16.3 Eco-Design
#### Parts marking
Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority).

### Mechanical Requirements.

#### 5.17.1 Load.
##### Operating loads:
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast.  
The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.

##### Special events:
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approximately < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur, and the intended service life will not be reduced.

##### Misuse events:
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact. The vehicle must be dimensioned such that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easily replaceable parts before body structure).

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations. Either to the same or at neighboring components (principle: "deformation before break").
Page 34
### 5.17.2 Vibration Behavior
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 30 Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VinFast. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in Chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.

### 5.17.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics
Not applicable.

### 5.17.4 Deformation
Not applicable.

### 5.17.5 Pressure
Not applicable.

### 5.17.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance
#### Fan
If the electrical control unit contains cooling fans, no tonal frequency bands are acceptable (adjacent bars must not exceed by 3 dB).  

#### S&R, General  
Noises perceived by customers as disturbing must be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier must guarantee that components are free of disturbing noise in their vehicle environment and geometrical integration. Similarly, at vehicle- and audio system excitation under all environmental conditions and over the component's fixed service life, there must be no squeak or rattle noise due to body excitation (e.g., wind load, torsional flexing).  

Relative movements on the surface must not result in noise under operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity). Evidence of disturbance-free noise must be coordinated with the responsible testing team.  

The supplier must support the development of vibration and acoustic behavior within the complete vehicle environment and ensure consistent acoustic quality of delivered parts. This includes actively pointing out issues and proposing solutions while delivering necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation free of charge.

### 5.18 Durability / Life Time
The durability of components is defined as 10 years or 160,000 km (whichever comes first).
