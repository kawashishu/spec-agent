### 5.3 Material requirement & Corrosion

Only the use of approved materials for each application from the European automobile industry is allowed. Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

The determination of corrosion requirements must classify the corrosivity position for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. **High Corrosivity:** The default classification for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** The default classification for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity.

Material combinations shall be chosen to prevent galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and attached brackets. In cases of critical material combinations, proper coating methods (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers) must be applied.

**Additional Requirements:**
- Avoid water and dirt accumulation; provide drainage at the lowest positions.
- Avoid dirt traps where sand can act as an abrasive and damage painted body surfaces with micro-movements.
- Contact surfaces to the body must be dry, made of non-abrasive materials, large enough for low pressure, and ensure minimized micro-movement.
- Ensure burr-free edge coverage with a paint system designed for effective edge coverage.

**Corrosion Tests:**  
The parts must pass both system/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests.  

1. **Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:**
   - Salt spray test: *ISO9227*, acceptance criteria provided.

2. **For Organic Coatings:**
   - Test procedures and acceptance criteria must be in accordance with supplied specifications.

Whenever possible, components must be tested in an assembled sub-system in the same position as installed on the vehicle.

**Chromed Metal Parts:**  
Chromed metal parts must be tested for 240 hours in NSS (ISO9227) without base material corrosion.  

**Chromed Plastic Parts:**  
- CASS-Test according to DIN EN ISO 9227 with the following durations:  
  - 48 hours for exterior parts  
  - 24 hours for interior parts  
- Also, 240 hours in NSS (ISO9227) without surface defects.  
- **Acceptance criteria:** No surface defects.

---

**Electrical Parts:**  
- Electrically functional units with enclosed air volumes (e.g., control units) must have moisture/wetness-resistant membranes (e.g., Gortex) in wet locations.  
- Materials must be chosen to avoid galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and brackets.  
- Avoid direct contact with noble metals like steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and anti-static rubber in wet environments.  
- Use corrosion-resistant surface treatments on all steel fasteners to ensure compatibility.  
- Electrical components must be installed to prevent vibrations that could cause fretting corrosion.  
- Terminals and connectors must not be placed at the lowest points to avoid moisture build-up.  
- Corrosion protection for electrical terminals must focus on ensuring their tightness against humidity.  
- Grounding surfaces must be water-tight in corrosive environments.  

**Aluminium/Sealing Surfaces:**  
- Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content above 1% should not be used for sealing surfaces due to their high corrosion sensitivity, which allows moisture to penetrate seals quickly.  

---

**Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues:**  
- Design measures must minimize the risk of damage caused by stone chipping, such as:  
  - Adding shielding parts in high-risk areas to protect damage-prone components.  
  - Enlarging radii of parts in areas prone to stone strikes to minimize potential damage.  
  - For high-risk areas, select part materials and paint with the same color to prevent visible abrasion marks.

### 5.4 Traceability
For part requirements, follow the specifications referenced in VinFast standard VFDST00010502 and VFDST00010501.

### 5.5 Labeling of Parts
Suppliers are required to follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Figures must be created to show the position of labels on parts (label positions should be set up using pictures).

### 5.6 Vehicle Architecture & Ergonomics
The complete vehicle must satisfy the requirements specified in the vehicle layout plans. Any changes to parts or modules that affect vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence must be immediately communicated to VinFast for separate evaluation.

**Styling Technique Convergence**  
- All changes affecting the vehicle's exterior or interior styling surfaces must be immediately communicated to VinFast for evaluation.  
- Suppliers must provide relevant technical input for styling evolution loops (e.g., tooling demands, assembly sequence) based on defined requirements from VinFast module leads. This input can be provided in the form of office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.

### 5.7 Vehicle Safety
The supplier must actively support the integration of vehicle safety functions. Lifetime-relevant laws, ratings of selling markets, and OEM requirements must be taken into account.

**General Demands:**  
- Vehicle safety functions must be thoroughly prepared at the system level using expertise, CAE, and testing.  
- Project-relevant supplier data must be provided to VinFast on request and free of charge. VinFast may forward this data to other project parties.  
- Performance targets must be fulfilled, including spread effects, through an adequate number of identical test series results.
Page 16
 Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand, e.g., to support and reach vehicle data freeze milestones. It must be realized within LsDyna, as well as validated, numerical, and physically stable.  
 FE meshes must be homogeneous, according to part axles/geometry and with a density of 8-10 mm. In case of non-keeping meshing guidelines, FE meshes must be re-worked.  
 For generating validated CAE material cards, activities must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier. This includes principal tests on systems as well as components.  
 Suppliers' test matrix must be defined according to full vehicle timing demands; before higher scaled tests are planned to be done (e.g., sled or vehicle crash tests), supplier optimization test series must be completed.  
 Supplier-specific parts needed for testing activities at any stage of the project must be provided by the supplier free of charge to the relevant testing facilities. However, in case of up-coming costs for physical parts and CAE models needed by the supplier, costs must also be absorbed by the supplier.  
 Integration of requests pointed out from the full vehicle crash optimization process at VF must be accepted without add-on costs; e.g., material definitions, material thicknesses, additional parts, optimizations work.  
 General requirements:
  - For each single target value, a mandatory 20% safety margin has to be applied.  
  - Occupant survival area integrity versus part behavior and fluids; this includes parts that are directly and indirectly in contact with any passengers.  
  - No edges below 3.2 mm during and after impact.  
  - Electrical system integrity during impact and for post-crash functions.  
  - Consideration of relevant tolerances.  
  - Robust target achievement.  
  - Asymmetries must be investigated on each side until a reliable worst-case is confirmed by VF.  
  - No modifiers for any Rating.  
 Additionally, specific demands are given:  
  - Without claim to be complete.  
  - Any tracking actions of concerned parties for observed issues must be done; e.g., to get parts/data/CAE models/information from further suppliers.  
  - Any devices, such as test bucks/sleds/etc., must be set up by the supplier, based on unfinished parts; e.g., a non-prepared BIW to be used as a sled.  
 For targets fully or partially fulfilled on a system level, the supplier has to prepare homologation and/or certification documents. Data has to be handed over to VF free of charge.  
 In case of carryover parts/systems, the fulfillment of system requirements can be shown using donor vehicle performance data.  

### 5.8 Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability)
- Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions (operating loads and special events).  
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics, derived from the application profile.  
- Definition of all requirements to ensure sufficient operational strength of the complete vehicle, subsystems, and components (this technical specification is the basis for all system and component technical specifications).  
- Mounting force must be lower than dismounting force.
Page 17
Operating loads:  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the base reference vehicles on tracks defined by VF.  

The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for MCE (mixed circuit Europe = long distance durability run). The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car, which is 160,000 km.  

The vehicle lifetime shall be at least 10 years.  

The environmental operating conditions are:  
- -30°C to +50°C ambient  
- 0 - 100% relative humidity  
- -100 m to 3,500 m above mean sea level  

Special events:  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g. ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.  

Misuse events:  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g. curbstone impact.  

The vehicle must be dimensioned that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g. steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g. easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations. Either to the same or at neighboring components (principle "deformation before break").
