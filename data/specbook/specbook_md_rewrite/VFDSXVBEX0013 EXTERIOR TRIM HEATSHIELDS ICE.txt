5.3 Material requirement & Corrosion.

Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low**: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium**: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. **High Corrosivity**: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very high Corrosivity**: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).

- **Avoid water and dirt accumulation**: Always provide drainage in the lowest positions. 
- **Avoid dirt traps**: Where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements. 
- **Contact surfaces to the body**: Shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.
- **Edge coverage**: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

### Corrosion Tests

The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

#### Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:
- **Salt Spray Test**: ISO9227, acceptance criteria detailed further in the document.

#### For Organic Coatings:
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT)**: ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria as defined below.
Page 10
Alternative tests can be proposed by suppliers and accepted by corrosion engineers.

**Groundings:**  
  - Grounding connection surfaces must be water-tight if located in corrosive environments.

**Aluminium/Sealing Surfaces:**  
  - Aluminium alloys containing copper and iron (>1%) are prone to corrosion and should be avoided for sealing surfaces due to rapid corrosion's potential to compromise moisture barriers.

**5.3 Material requirement & Corrosion**  

- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.  
- In areas of high stone-hitting risk, choose part materials and paint that have the same color, to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.  
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.  
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them, so they cannot be hit easily by stones.

### Emissions & Toxicology
Not applicable.

### Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization
Not applicable.

### Recycling

#### Recycled Materials
When selecting materials, attention is focused on reducing the variety of materials and ensuring compatibility with available recycling procedures (referred to as ‘proven recycling technologies’). Secondary raw materials, such as post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics), must be preferred based on market availability. Recycled materials must be marked in accordance with parts marking standards defined in this specification book and reported to the environmental compliance expert team at VinFast.

#### Recycling Scheme
The chapter establishes general project-wide requirements for the recycling and repair scheme in the development of components. Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end of life. The provided recycling scheme must illustrate the potential recycling processes for the component, including preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. This scheme must be submitted to the environmental expert team at VinFast before reaching the milestone PTO (Production Try-Out).

### Evaporative Emissions
Not applicable.

### Drainage and Depollution
Complete drainage of fluids is required for safe and environmentally friendly End-of-Life vehicle treatment. Fluid niches and pockets must be eliminated to ensure complete removal.
Page 17
Drainage scheme including virtual or physical test protocol must provide the following information to the VinFast environmental experts team before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out:
- Type of drained fluids.
- Amount of drained fluids (in weight-%).
- Absolute mass of drained fluid in kg.

### 7 Homologation and Safety Regulations

**a. Homologation and Safety Regulation Activities**  
The supplier must ensure compliance of their part(s), product(s), or system(s) with the applicable regulations, including European standards, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS). Suppliers must provide or support documentation for submission to the relevant authorities.

**b. Self-certification and Test Report(s)**  
The supplier is responsible for self-certifying their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all FMVSS/CMVSS regulations before those products can be offered for sale.  
VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as defined in FMVSS/CMVSS. Test reports must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
Suppliers must be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS (refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer Handbook).

**c. Duty to Notify VinFast of Non-compliance**  
If a supplier determines that a product fails to meet FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or contains a safety-related defect, they must notify VinFast within five working days. A risk assessment and resolution plan must also be proposed to address the issue.

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities  
The Supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.  

b. Test report(s) and Certificate(s)  
The supplier is responsible for ensuring their part(s), product(s) or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale.  
VinFast requests Suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain of the UN-ECE at authorized technical service(s). The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
VinFast also requests Suppliers to provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings, to be submitted to the relevant authorities in order to obtain certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any).   
The Supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The Supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
