**Image of the shut off valve**

![Shut Off Valve](attached_image_url)

**Refrigerant Shut Off Valve Key Operating Points:**
- Refrigerant: R134a/R1234YF
- Operating Voltage: 9-18V
- Valve Action: 0V - Open, 12V - Closed

The solenoid valve is controlled by VCU. When VCU detects insufficient battery heat dissipation, or fails to meet the battery heat dissipation requirements after increasing the compressor speed, VCU will close the solenoid valve switch, cutting off the refrigerant into HVAC, suspending refrigeration in the air-conditioning system to accelerate power battery heat dissipation. When the power battery heat dissipation reaches the set value, the solenoid valve reopens, allowing refrigerant into the HVAC and resuming air-conditioning system cooling.

**3.3 General CAE Requirements**  
Refer to SOR:  
VFSRXXCVC0201  
VFCAE-001-FEM-GENERAL_Analysis requirement  

**3.4 Material requirement**  
- **Prohibited or Restricted Substances, Emissions & Toxicology:**  
  The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification must be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier through the complete product life cycle according to VFDST00007601.  

IMDS material data sheets must be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID, adhering to the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and VFDST00007601.  

Specifications related to vehicle indoor air quality must conform to:  
VFDSXVCVC3401 - VIAQ_Testing_Guideline
Page 8
3 Requirements.

3.5 Traceability.
For part requirements, follow specifications as outlined in VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

3.6 Labeling of Parts.
Suppliers must adhere to VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Suppliers are required to create figures indicating the positioning of labels on parts, including setup pictures.

3.7 Testing and Validation and DVP&R.
Testing and validation responsibilities follow RASIC guidelines. DVP (virtual and physical testing) must be conducted on System, Sub-system, and Component Levels in alignment with the Complete Vehicle Specification Book during the concept phase. Detailed test plans for hardware tests must be documented in the DVP&R file and coordinated with the Testing & Validation department.

Specific testing requirements include:
- Declaring standard, norm, and legal requirements.
- Providing detailed descriptions and images of the setup and devices used during testing.
- Specifying whether testing was conducted internally or externally.
- Outlining testing duration and timeline in the form of a project plan.
- Providing a comprehensive description of the part variant.
- Reporting the number of tested components or parts.

Ensure the Mileage Target Life for the part is either 160,000 km or 10 years, whichever comes first.

The associated document file: **DVP_Shut off valve.xlsx**.

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.
Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable. Details of the AAR process are described in VinFast standard VFDST00038401 and include the quantity of parts and timing.

Supplier Responsibilities:
- Submit parts to VinFast Quality Design for evaluation according to agreed timelines to achieve OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.
- Begin this process in early phases (e.g., PT build) to secure approval during LS.
- Incorporate this activity in the development process as part of the ED&D cost.

Note: The part is not subject to customer appearance considerations.
