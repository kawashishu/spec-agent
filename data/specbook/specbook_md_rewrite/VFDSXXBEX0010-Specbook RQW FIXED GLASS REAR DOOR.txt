Mechanical requirements such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety are to be ensured using FEM calculations. 

Tool-dimensioning for injection molding must be optimized using simulations, and FEM models representing the development status of the component must be made available to VF upon request. FEM models from the FSS SUP must be provided without extra cost.

Evaluative documentation (e.g., FEM) must precede tool dimensioning according to the evaluation plan.

### 3.7.2.5 Component Testing
The detailed testing requirements must be defined in the DVP. The DVP must be approved by VinFast and the FSS SUP and will be binding.
Page 27
3.7.2.6 Mechanical integration tests.

The following tests will be conducted as mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle:
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100).
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800).
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000).
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600).

No distortion or functional disturbance across the full functional temperature range as per VTS specification is allowed. The behavior of materials with high and diverse thermal expansion coefficients must remain consistent. Tolerances of the flush and gap plan after climate tests and sun simulation must not be exceeded.  

If VinFast orders parts for testing independently, the detailed description of those parts must be included. Testing parts must also be provided by the FSS SUP free of charge for testing activities at VinFast’s test department.

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.

Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is detailed in VFDST00038401, which specifies the quantity of parts and associated timing.  

The supplier is responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design for each step in the process, following agreed timelines, to obtain OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval. The process begins early in the PT build phase to secure AAR Approval at LS.  

The supplier must incorporate these activities into their development process and include them in ED&D costs.
