8.2 CSC functional characteristic and application guidance.

Table 4: CSC functions:
1. **CSC category**: There are two types available:
   - 3AFE.
   - 4AFE.
   - Multiple CSC combinations can be selected according to project requirements, such as two 4AFE.
2. **Number of single AFE voltage samples**: Supports 8–16 string configuration. Note: The minimum number of samples for each chip is 8 cells. If there are fewer than 8 cells, the chip will not work properly.
3. **Number of temperature samples for a single AFE**: Includes 8 temperature samples, of which 2 are CSC board temperature samples and 6 are module temperature samples.
4. **Balance resistor**: Value 24.5Ω.
