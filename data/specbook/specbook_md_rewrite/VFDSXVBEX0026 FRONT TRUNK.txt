### 5.3 Material Requirement & Corrosion  

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

---

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen to prevent galvanic corrosion. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added, such as paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers.

Avoid water and dirt accumulation by always providing drainage in the lowest positions. Additionally, avoid dirt traps where sand could act as an abrasive and damage the painted body through micro-movements.

Contact surfaces to the body should remain dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive materials. Minimize micro-movement. Ensure burr-free edges with a paint system that delivers good edge coverage.

---

5.3 Material requirement & Corrosion.
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”). 

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. Corrosivity Low: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
2. Corrosivity Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
3. High corrosivity: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. Very high corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In the case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).

Avoid water and dirt accumulation; always provide drainage in the lowest positions. Also avoid dirt traps where sand can act as an abrasive and damage the painted body through micro-movements. Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.

Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

- **Component test for Metallic surfaces:**  
  Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria outlined below.

- **For Organic coatings:**  
  Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria outlined below.

- **Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:**  
  - **Rust creep (ISO4628-8):**  
    Galvanized steel: d≤4 mm.  
    Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d≤1-2 mm.  
  - **Blistering:** Blister size max. S2 (DIN EN ISO4628-2).  
  - **Edge corrosion:** ≤10%.  
  - **Weld seam corrosion:** ≤5%.  
  - **Degree of rusting:** ≤Ri 1 (ISO4628-3).  

- **Stainless steel:** Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion). Insulating coatings are needed. Test criteria for highly visible parts: 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface (especially crevice areas).  

- **Aluminum parts:**  
  - High visible areas must be painted or anodized.  
  - Painted Aluminum Test: Follow criteria for organic coatings.  
  - Anodized Aluminum Test: 480 h NSS ISO9227 without change of surface.
Page 11
Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

**Chromed metal parts:**  
240h NSS ISO9227 without base material corrosion.

**Chromed plastic parts:**  
CASS-Test according to DIN EN ISO 9227; duration:  
- 48h for Exterior  
- 24h for Interior  

Acceptance criteria: no surface defects.  
Additionally: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.

**Electric parts:**  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations.  

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.  
Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.  

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  
Terminals, connectors: Do not place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is, first of all, a requirement for tightness—electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  
Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.  

**Aluminium/sealing surfaces:**   
Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of >1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.

**Prevention of stone chipping issues:**  
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:  
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.  
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.  
- In areas of high stone hitting risk, choose part materials and paint that have the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.

5.3 Material requirement & Corrosion.
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. Corrosivity Low: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. Corrosivity Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. High corrosivity: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. Very high corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers). Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in the lowest positions. Also, avoid dirt traps where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements. Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement. Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

Corrosion tests:
The parts must pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.
- Component test for metallic surfaces: Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.
- For organic coatings: Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below. Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

Page 13
Styling Technique Convergence.

All changes on parts and modules that affect the exterior and/or interior styling surfaces of the vehicle must be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation. Part or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops must be provided by the supplier (e.g., tooling demands, assembly sequence), based on defined requirements from VinFast module leads. Technical input can be provided in various formats such as office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.

5.7 Vehicle Safety.

In case of safety-relevant parts, cooperation with the MSE vehicle safety department is required:
- Occupant survival area integrity must not be violated by behavior; for example, no edges below 3.2 mm during and after impact are allowed.
- Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand to support and reach vehicle data freeze milestones. These models must be realized within LsDyna, validated, numerical, and physically stable.
- FE meshes must be homogeneous and correspond to part axles/geometry, with a density of 8-10 mm. If meshing guidelines are not followed, FE meshes must be reworked.
- For generating validated CAE material cards, activities must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier. This includes principle tests on both system and components.

5.8 Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability).

- Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions, including operating loads and special events.
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile.
- Definition of requirements to ensure the sufficient operational strength of the complete vehicle, subsystems, and components. This technical specification serves as the basis for all system and component technical specifications.
- Mounting force must always be lower than dismounting force.

Material information, parts marking & substance information for VinFast.

The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification have to be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier.

- The conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured by the supplier through the complete product life cycle.
- For PPAP material data sheets (MDS) in IMDS according to IMDS Rules and Guidelines IMDS 001 and IMDS Recommendations 002 - 022 are required. Updates are required for changes.

Material data sheets have to be provided by the supplier to VinFast IMDS-ID 214435.

Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations which have been defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<).

Material safety data sheets (SDS) according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including the national chemical inventory 2017) have to be provided to VinFast for milestone concept confirmation. Consider local rules for SDS creation and UN-guidelines as per the Globally Harmonized System of Classification, Labelling, and Packaging of Chemicals.

### Emissions & Toxicology
Not applicable.

### Pyrotechnic initiator neutralization
Not applicable.

### Recycling:
#### Recycled Materials
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’).

Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert team at VinFast.

#### Recycling Scheme
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.
Page 17
Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor must show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. This recycling scheme must be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### Evaporative Emissions
Not applicable.

### Drainage and Depollution
Complete drainage of fluids is required for safe and environmentally friendly End-of-Life vehicle treatment. For complete removal, fluid niches and pockets must be avoided. A drainage scheme, including virtual or physical test protocol with information on the type of drained fluids, the amount of drained fluids (in weight-%) and the absolute mass of drained fluid in kilograms, must be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.
