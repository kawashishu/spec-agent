1 General Document Guidelines  

1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.  
This version is legally binding.  
This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard.  

Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g. what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g. level 3 vs level 2, then level 2 is applicable).  

1.2 Language.  
This document is written in English.  
All official project documentations must be written in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.  

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.  
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.  

**Shall:**  
The word “shall” be used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.  

**Should:**  
The word “should” be used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.  

**May:**  
The word “may” be used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

**BS ISO 26262-3, clause 5.4.1, b)**  
The EDS systems shall work whilst the vehicle is in any state. Devices required to operate in specific vehicle states will be connected to the appropriate power supplies within the vehicle fuseboxes.
Page 23
BS ISO 26262-3, clause 5.4.1, c)  
The EDS shall function within the following voltage limits:  
LV 0-16V, HV 0-450V  

BS ISO 26262-3, clause 5.4.1, d)  
The climatic operating environment shall be considered as -40 to +70 °C.  

BS ISO 26262-3, clause 5.4.1, e)  
Potential consequences of failing to provide electrical power when required are covered within the FUSA documentation for each device connected to the EDS.  

BS ISO 26262-3, clause 5.4.1, f)  
The EDS circuit design shall consider the current requirements for each device connected to it. If the current level is exceeded, the circuit will be protected via a fuse. The wire gauge shall be increased for circuits where the voltage drop calculations require this to happen.  

BS ISO 26262-3, clause 5.4.2  
The boundary of the EDS shall be the interfacing connectors to devices and the physical connections to BiW. The EDS system is an integral part of many vehicle functions and shall be considered in the FUSA assessment of each of those functions.  

### Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment Report  
BS ISO 26262-3, clause 6.5.1  
The EDS system is an integral part of many vehicle functions and shall be considered in the FUSA assessment of each of those functions.  

### Functional Safety Concept  
BS ISO 26262-3, clause 7.5.1  
The EDS system is an integral part of many vehicle functions and shall be considered in the FUSA assessment of each of those functions.
