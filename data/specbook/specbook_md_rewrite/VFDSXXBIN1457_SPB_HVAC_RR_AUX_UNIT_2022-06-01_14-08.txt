The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.

**Important:** If the supplier will/want to use other components, it has to be confirmed by VINFAST.

**AC System Lay Out (only as reference):**

The AC system comprises of AC Compressor ASM, AC Condenser ASM, Refrigerant Expansion device, Refrigeration plumbing, HVAC FRT UNIT, and RR AUX UNIT. The technical information should show the details of parts/components.
Page 7
HVAC RR AUX UNIT includes the Heating, Ventilation, Cooling functions. There are two types of air supply modes: VENT (3rd Row) and FOOT (3rd Row). Air flow has up to four-stage adjustable levels. One type of air supply mode is available: RECIRC. Additionally, it supports Full Cold/Hot or Mixed modes. All of these functions are controlled by actuators. The air suctioned by the blower unit is directly cooled or warmed as it moves through the heat exchangers, and then sent to defined outlets via air ducts, ultimately reaching outlets and grilles.

The air inlet body allows air intake from the vehicle interior. Main parts for this body are:
- Air blower unit (motor and blower)
- Heat exchangers
- Airflow control doors
- Actuators
- Air sensors
- Refrigerant expansion valves (TXV, Sol-TXV, or EXV)
- Drain hose
- Wire harness
- Case shell
- Sponge seal
- Fixation points

The HVAC RR AUX UNIT must be designed to ensure its function is fulfilled in combination with its adjacent components/subsystems. The HVAC RR AUX UNIT subsystem provides the following functions:
- Provide cooled and dehumidified air to the VENT air duct system.
- Provide heated air to the FOOT air duct system for 3rd Row seats.
- Provide blended air (warm) for VENT mode.
- Control refrigerant pressure and flow into the evaporator using a thermal expansion valve (either TXV or electronic control valve) for R134a systems.
- Drain condensate water from the AC evaporator.
- Provide evaporator air temperature sensor for compressor control.

The HVAC RR AUX UNIT evaporator and TXV are compatible with R134a for all Markets (Vietnam, US, Europe, and Canada).

### HVAC RR AUX UNIT Components

### HVAC RR AUX UNIT Squeak and Rattle Requirements

The requirement for this program is to have absolutely no customer annoyance due to squeaks and rattles. The final authority for the determination of whether a noise is objectionable lies with VinFast HVAC systems and/or the Squeak and Rattle (S&R) Engineers. 

Squeaks and rattles include, but are not limited to, all the noises described in the "Squeak & Rattle Noise Glossary." The supplier is to accept full responsibility to produce squeak- and rattle-free “as delivered” subsystems and/or components. They shall also cooperate with VinFast Engineering and/or other suppliers to assure that no squeak and rattle annoyances occur at the interface of their subsystem/component to the body, interior, or other subsystems/components.

If an objectionable noise is found during any phase of the program, it will be the supplier's responsibility, with VinFast Engineering cooperation, to eliminate the noise and demonstrate resolution in a vehicle prior to exiting the program phase. If the noise is found in pilot or production, the supplier will be responsible for developing a containment plan (and fix), as well as short- and long-term solutions, as appropriate.

Any issue raised during these processes which is demonstrated as the responsibility of the supplier shall be corrected with urgency at no additional cost to VinFast. The supplier will be responsible for the Squeak and Rattle performance of their subsystem.
