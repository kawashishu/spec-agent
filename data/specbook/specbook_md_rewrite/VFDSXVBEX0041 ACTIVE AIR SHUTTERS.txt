### 5.1.1 Function

The assembly active grille, including the air flaps, has the primary task of regulating (opening and closing) the air intake for the car in the front bumper area. It opens demand-oriented, providing fresh air for the cooling systems. As a result, the Cd-value is improved by controlling the airflow depending on the driving velocity.

- For the upper and lower grille air intake, the active shutter system (air flap control), including the air duct, is to be developed. The system and the air flaps are positioned behind the grill.
- The upper and lower trim grilles are not part of the development requirement.
- The active grille module interacts with the complete cooling air routing. Therefore, a leak-tight connection to neighboring components must be ensured.
- The vehicle-specific overall leakage flow is defined by the VinFast department as well as the level of interference noise. If necessary, separate seals must be provided for this purpose.
- A connector cable for the actuator to the car wiring harness regarding layout and mounting is to be considered by the SDS.

The actuator is specified by SDS and must be agreed with VinFast. It shall be taken into account for the design of the air flap control and is part of the scope of development.

### 5.1.2 General

The development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies shall be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability. No complaints (zero faults) shall occur at the time of delivery and over the average service life.
Page 10
Overall function. Development targets include prevention of functional and quality problems out of known systems, use of standard and common parts if possible or reasonable, process reliability across production, packaging, transport, and assembly, and minimizing effort in the overall production sequence. Displacement prevention, integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of the part package, early inclusion of neighboring component developers, general cost reduction compared to predecessor models, optical and functional improvements, and ensuring functionality within the requested temperature range are also specified goals.

5.1.3 Air entrance front opening/closing. The air flap control's primary task is sealing the cooling air inlet in the front of the vehicle and selectively opening it for cooling air as needed. When closed, the system significantly reduces the cx value of the vehicle. All flaps are designed to open and close simultaneously; independent upper/lower flap operation is not needed.

5.1.4 Stiffness, rigidity, and stability of shape. The components and bracket design must assure no instability is noticeable, especially near operating elements. Features like irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, and visible waviness under climatic loads are prohibited. The parts must comply with pedestrian protection requirements in the front end and avoid permanent deformation through assembly, delivery, varnishing, and production phases. Air flaps must not flutter under any conditions.

5.1.5 Product characteristics. Active grille components must account for all tolerances related to parts and assemblies, including thermal expansion. Functionality must be validated over tolerances, including heat extension. Material-specific thermal expansions must also be incorporated into gap tolerance definitions.
Page 11
- The deformation after climate tests must remain within the fixed tolerance of flush and gap dimensions.
- Tolerance analyses must be submitted to the responsible development departments or persons.
- Assembly compatibility with adjoining components must be ensured.
- Functional safety under all loads depicted in drawings, test specifications, quality specifications, and legal texts must be assured.
- Noise caused by the function of components or unfavorable tolerances in joints must be avoided.
- Legal requirements related to safety-relevant matters must be met with appropriate proof provided.
- All components must remain functional across the defined temperature range.

### 5.1.6 Specifications for the design

The active grille (air flap control) design must ensure the opening of flaps during all operating states. This includes operation under vmax conditions, defined as 250 km/h plus 30 km/h headwind (total 280 km/h).

- The design must also ensure the closing of flaps, even in maximum operating conditions.
- The air flap control must withstand 185,000 load cycles including:
  - 40,000 initializations while stationary.
  - 145,000 load cycles during driving operations, of which 45,000 cycles should consider maximum wind speed conditions.
  - Load scenarios should align with the VF department's specifications.
  
- The air duct integration into the frame should include a soft rubber lip (2k injection-molded) at the front tip to minimize air leakage between the duct and bumper fascia.
- Reassembling joints without damage is required, with designs capable of absorbing crash loads.
- Mounting concepts should include suitable lugs and mounting elements, ensuring ease of alignment during assembly (x, y, z) as needed and coordinated with VF departments.

Additional design considerations include:
- Reinforcement of screwing points to the body where applicable.
- Hard/soft part components (2 or 3-K parts) must endure bending back and forth five times at 80°C without permanent damage.
- Installation may vary depending on the engine and target market:
  - Both upper and lower active shutters may be installed, or only lower shutters as a standalone assembly.
  - Lower active shutters should incorporate the actuator with independent functionality from the upper active shutters.
  - The upper active shutters' mechanical linkage must allow operation via actuators mounted on the lower active shutters.
Page 12
5.1.7 Variants. Depending on the market and engine choice, vehicles may come with upper and lower active shutters, only lower active shutters, or only the frames with no active shutters. Table 1 provides detailed information regarding these variants.

Variant 1: Vehicles in the US and EU markets with ICE engines will feature both upper and lower active shutters.

Variant 2: BEV vehicles designed for the US and EU markets will be equipped with only lower active shutters.

Variant 3: ICE vehicles for ASEAN markets will include only the upper and lower frames without air flaps or additional components.
Page 13
### 5.1.7 Variants
Depending on market and chosen engine, either both upper and lower active shutters or only lower active shutters will be fitted. For vehicles without active shutters, only the frames will be fitted. Refer to Table 1 for a detailed variant overview.

#### Variant 1: 
Upper and lower active shutters (ICE variants for US and EU market).

5.3 Material requirement & Corrosion.

Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. Corrosivity Low:
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

2. Corrosivity Medium:
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

3. High corrosivity:
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. Very high corrosivity:
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle Exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes also fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination a proper coating must be added (Paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  
Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in lowest positions.  
Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements.  
Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.  
Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.  

**Corrosion tests:**  
The parts have to pass System/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

**Component test for Metallic surfaces:**  
Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.  

**For Organic coatings:**  
Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.

Contact with noble metals (e.g., steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel) or conductive/anti-static rubber in wet areas must be avoided. Surface treatments for steel fasteners should ensure long-term corrosion resistance and compatibility with surrounding materials.

Vibrations must not lead to fretting corrosion in electrical components. Terminals should not be placed in the lowest areas to reduce corrosion risks due to moisture exposure. Electrical connections must remain protected from humidity. 

**Groundings:**
Connecting surfaces for grounding must have water-tight placement in corrosive environments. 

**Sealing Surfaces:**
Aluminum alloys with copper and iron content above 1% should be avoided for sealing surfaces to prevent rapid corrosion that breaches seals and allows moisture ingress.

**Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues:**
Design measures should minimize risks of damage to the body and related parts caused by stone chipping:
- Shielding parts should be implemented for vulnerable areas.
- Enlarged radii in high-risk zones can prevent severe damage.

Execution of component tests with assembled subsystems in situ should occur wherever possible.
