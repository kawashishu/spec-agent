### 3.2 Technical requirement

#### Overview

Due to the need for more power and more time running on a single charge, it is necessary to connect more than one battery cell into the battery pack to increase the overall battery pack capacity. This is achieved by connecting several batteries in series or parallel.

Based on the module design, a number of battery cells are to be connected within a battery cell holder (a module), and several modules are arranged in a battery pack. In a single module, the metal plate is a wiring component used to electrically connect the cell electrodes in series or in parallel. After welding, batteries are welded together into one battery module assembly. 

In addition, the metal plate plays an important role in providing desired electrical and thermal characteristics combined with mechanical strengths.

In general, the selection of metal plate material and its thickness are largely based on the current carrying capacity, mechanical and electrical characteristics, and cost. 

There are 28 types of metal plates used in the Battery Pack VF36.
