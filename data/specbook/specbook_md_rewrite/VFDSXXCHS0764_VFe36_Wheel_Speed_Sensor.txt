3 Requirements

### 3.2.1 General Description of the Component
Refer to the 2D drawing and DVP document for more details of the functional requirements. Wheel speed sensors must detect the speed of the wheels and supply this information to the ABS or ESP control unit in the form of an electrical signal.

### 3.2.2 Wheel Speed Sensor FRONT
Figure 1 provides a detailed drawing of the front wheel speed sensor, showing its design, sensing area, and connection specifications.

### 3.2.3 Wheel Speed Sensor REAR
Figure 2 illustrates the rear wheel speed sensor, including its dimensions, sensing area, and assembly configuration.
Page 8
## 3.2.4 Function

### Intended use
The use of WSS is restricted to earth-bound vehicles, engines, or machines. This document comprises all specifications and tests for the WSS (without dynamic line testing) as a component of the brake system (e.g., the Anti-Lock Braking System “ABS,” the Traction Control “ASR,” the Electronic Stability Control “ESC”). 

The WSS is meant only for the mentioned application above. For defects and damages caused by other applications or applications in ambient and application conditions not defined in this specification, it is the responsibility of the customer to ensure the proper application of the product in the vehicle.

---

### Misuse
Any usage of the WSS other than earth-bound vehicles, engines, or machines is not allowed. Any usage not adhering to the specifications and conditions described in this document is prohibited. Examples of misuse include aircrafts, light aircrafts, jets, military use, and underwater operation.

The proper function of the WSS is only guaranteed if operated with appropriate ECU and system components. Misuse of the WSS may lead to critical and unexpected system behavior like unwanted brake interventions. 

The Wheel Speed Sensor is used to generate speed pulse signals induced by a rotating target wheel in an appropriate air gap. Non-application relevant or incompatible use/test cases are not covered by this specification.

For example:
- It is prohibited to increase the magnetic air gap during a standstill phase of the target wheel, which reduces the magnetic flux density in the sensor elements by more than 50%.
- Lowering magnetic field strength from one pole to another by more than 50% is disallowed.
- In such cases, the sensor could signal standstill pulses if programmed as i- or v-protocol type or remain at its current signal level if programmed as s-protocol even when the target wheel starts rotation again.

The sensor shall not be disassembled and reinstalled.
Page 9
## Interface

### Sensor Head Installation Constraints
The sensor head must be inserted into a mounting hole smoothly without any tightness. For mounting hole dimensions, refer to **Figure 3** and **Figure 4**. The sensor head shall be free from damage after being attached with an M6x1.0 bolt and a tightening torque of **9.5±2.5 Nm**.

#### Figure 3: Mounting Hole Dimensions Front Knuckle
The diagram illustrates the necessary specifications for the front knuckle sensor installation, including detailed dimensional references.

#### Figure 4: Mounting Hole Dimensions Rear
The diagram illustrates the necessary specifications for the rear sensor installation, including detailed dimensional references.

Cable Harness  
The cable harness consists of a cable with a 4.2mm outer diameter and a 2-pole connector at its end. The cable will be fixed to the body, Knuckle, and Yoke with grommets clipped into steel brackets. For dimensions and orientation of the cable and grommets, refer to the drawing. The proof-pull-load of grommets in axial dimensions is 30N.  

Figure 5: Cable bracket interface.  

Output Signal  
The output signal of the sensor to detect RPM is defined according to Figure 6. RPM between 1 and 1350 can be detected. For further details of the sensor and the specific sensor element used, refer to Continental Spec ATE N 555 12.55 SH 050.  

Figure 6: Output signal definition.
Page 11
# Connector System

The connector system establishes the electrical contact between the Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS) and the customer harness. It consists of a WSS-connector and the vehicle-specific mating connector, which create the connector system when plugged into each other. Detailed specifications are provided in Figure 7.

**Figure 7:** Wheelspeedsensor connector.

3 Requirements.

3.2 Technical requirements.

3.2.1 General Description of the Component.
Refer to the 2D drawing and DVP document for more details of the functional requirements. Wheel speed sensors must detect the speed of the wheels and supply this information to the ABS or ESP control unit in the form of an electrical signal.

3.2.2 Wheel speed sensor FRONT.
Figure 1 illustrates the drawing of the front wheel speed sensor.

3.2.3 Wheel speed sensor REAR.
Figure 2 illustrates the drawing of the rear wheel speed sensor.

3.2.4 Function.

Intended use.
The use of the Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS) is restricted to earth-bounded vehicles, engines, or machines. This document includes all specifications and tests for the WSS (excluding dynamic line testing) as a component of the brake system (e.g., the Anti-Lock Braking System “ABS”, the Traction Control “ASR”, the Electronic Stability Control “ESC”). The WSS is only intended for the application defined above. Defects and damages caused by other applications, ambient conditions, or application conditions not defined within this specification are not covered. 

It is the customer's responsibility to ensure proper application of the product in the vehicle.

Misuse.
Any usage of the WSS outside of earth-bounded vehicles, engines, or machines is prohibited. Usage not following the specifications and conditions described in this document (e.g., application in aircrafts, jets, underwater operations, military use) is strictly unauthorized. 

The proper functioning of the WSS is guaranteed only when operated with compatible ECU systems and components. Misuse of the WSS may lead to critical and unexpected behavior like unnecessary brake interventions. The sensor generates speed pulse signals induced by a rotating target wheel within an appropriate air gap. Any deviations from application-specific use cases or non-compatible methods are excluded from this specification.

For example:
- It is prohibited to increase the magnetic air gap during the target wheel's standstill phase to reduce the magnetic flux density in sensor elements by more than 50%.
- It is forbidden to lower the magnetic field strength from one pole to the other beyond a reduction threshold of 50%.

Manual adjustments to the sensor are not allowed.

3.3 Interface.

Sensor Head Installation constraints.
The sensor head must be inserted into a mounting hole with smooth alignment, free of tightness. Mounting hole dimensions are provided in Figures 3 and 4. The sensor head must remain undamaged after installation using an M6x1.0 bolt and applying a tightening torque of 9.5 ± 2.5Nm.

Figure 3 illustrates mounting hole dimensions for the front knuckle.  
Figure 4 illustrates mounting hole dimensions for the rear section.

3.4 Cable Harness.

The cable harness comprises a cable with a 4.2mm outer diameter and a two-pole connector at its end. The cable is fixed to the body, knuckle, and yoke using grommets clipped into steel brackets. The dimensions and orientation of the cable and its grommets are determined in associated drawings. For interface to brackets, refer to Figure 5.

Proof-pull-load for axial dimension grommets is 30N.

Figure 5 illustrates the cable bracket interface.

Output Signal.
The output signal of the sensor defines RPM detection ranges from 1 to 1350 RPM. Refer to Continental Spec ATE N 555 12.55 SH 050 for sensor-specific element details.

Figure 6 illustrates the output signal definition.

3.5 Connector System.

This system ensures electrical contact between the WSS and the customer harness. It includes a WSS connector and a mating vehicle-specific connector which, when plugged together, create the complete connection system. Refer to Figure 7.

Connector Attachment.
The connector system attaches to the body via a clip held on the Sensor Harness. For clip dimensions, refer to Figure 8.

Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the wheelspeed sensor connector system and clip interface.

3.6 Reading area.

The sensitive portion of the WSS located directly across the target wheel surface is identified as the sensor reading area. The definition of the reading point is shown in Figure 9.

Mechanical air gap.
The mechanical air gap is defined as the distance between the sensor reading area and the surface of the target wheel, which must remain between 0.5mm and 1.9mm during installation.

Figure 9 illustrates the reading point definition.
