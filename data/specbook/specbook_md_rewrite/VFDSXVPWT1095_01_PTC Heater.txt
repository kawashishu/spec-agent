1 Introduction.

1.1 Scope.

This specification is for an electrical coolant heater (CH) for automotive use. The heater is specified for a voltage range as typical in electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicle applications. The primary use and validation of the CH are oriented towards its application as the primary heat source for vehicle interior climatic adjustment.

The heater is intended for application both in drive mode and as a park heater when the vehicle is connected to the mains. In the heating process, electrical energy is efficiently converted to thermal energy. This product typically achieves a faster heating effect than a combustion engine.

In parallel, the support for battery climatic adjustment (heating to operating temperature) and fuel cell start-up load is possible. Special security requirements for these applications, such as over-temperature of the battery, must be given by the car architecture.

The CH PTC-technology is implemented to meet the high safety requirements set for high-voltage components in passenger vehicles. Moreover, the CH is designed as an engine compartment component meeting respective environmental requirements. A selection of key HV norms was applied in the development.

The coolant heater, in its intended application, replaces the engine block as the main heat source of the vehicle. It is plugged into the coolant line prior to the heat exchanger (located in the HVAC). The heater uses rectified mains or battery/alternator power for heating. Due to the PTC effect, the coolant flow is heated in an intrinsically safe way. The PTC elements restrict the maximum achievable system temperature, even in a worst-case scenario (without reliance on electronics), to a level that the surroundings can withstand reliably. The vehicle energy management system (not part of the CH) is expected to allocate the most suitable amount and source of energy to the CH.

3.1.5.7.16 LIN Fault Detection.  
If the ECU detects one of the following faults, it should react with corresponding error reactions:  

**Error Scenarios:**  
1. **No LIN message is received for 4 seconds (tlintimeout):**  
   - Reaction: All heater legs will be switched off, and the heater will go to sleep.  

2. **Invalid power request (more than 100% or change from valid request to Init or SNA):**  
   - Reaction: The latest valid power request shall be maintained for 2 seconds. Then the heater will be switched off, and the signal HV_PTC_Sp_LIN_Flt will be set to 1.  

**Table Representation:**  
Error scenarios and their respective reactions are summarized in tab. 34.
Page 31
3.1.5.7.17 Sleep-Mode. If there is no LIN communication detected on the LIN bus for at least 4 seconds, the heater will go into sleep-mode. During sleep-mode, the control electronic is switched off and the LV supply current drops below 100µA. The heater will wake up as soon as LIN communication is detected.

3.1.5.7.18 Ramp-up function. The heater has a ramp-up function. New power requests will not be transferred instantly to output power. To increase power from 0% to 100%, it takes approximately 14 seconds at 0°C. If the temperature is below 0°C, the ramp-up function may take up to 28 seconds. This function is implemented to prevent high inrush currents on the HV-bus.

**Figure 25**: Ramp-up current curve graph. The graph demonstrates the current curve during ramping-up, illustrating the power transitions over time to alleviate high inrush currents.

3.1.5.7.19 Active HV-bus discharge. It is possible to use the coolant-heater for active HV-bus discharging. This may be implemented in case of service or crash scenarios involving the vehicle. In such cases, it is recommended to leave an active power request when the battery is switched off or set LIN Discharge Request to "discharge requested." Emergency shutdown must not be requested. This action lowers the HV-bus voltage to less than 60 volts.

4.1.3 Technical Safety Concept.

The Heating System / HVCH consists of two sub-modules:
- The Electronic Module.
- The Heating Module.

The intended functions of the HVCH are the following:
- Supply of HV to the PTC heating elements via the IGBTs.
- Control of the heating current via the IGBTs by software and outlet temperature.

#### Safety Functions (mechanisms) of Heating Module:
- An over-temperature in the heating module will be detected by software through the outlet temperature and the heating current will be interrupted by IGBTs through software (QM).
- In addition, the PTC heating elements will limit the heating current and therefore the temperature independent of the electronic module (ASIL A).
- In addition, the sealed metal housing of the heating module (other technologies) will protect the HVCH from overheating (QM).

#### Safety Functions (mechanisms) of Electronic Module:
- An over-temperature in the electronic module will be detected by software through temperature and the heating current will be interrupted by IGBTs through software (QM).
- In addition, the sealed metal housing of the electronic module (other technologies) will protect the HVCH from overheating (QM).

4.2 Electronic Safety Monitoring Cycle

### 4.2.1 Temperature safety on PCB
There are 2 temperature sensors (NTCs) which are used for temperature monitoring in order to switch off or reduce power in case of over temperature on the PCB.

To avoid overheating in case of defect of temperature sensors, they are permanently checked for a plausible signal level. In case of a defect temperature sensor, the heater will be switched off.

**Temperature Monitoring Process on PCB:**
- If the temperature is greater than or equal to 120°C, power reduction is applied.
- If the temperature is less than or equal to 115°C, all heating circuits are turned ON.
- If the temperature is greater than or equal to 125°C, power is turned OFF.
- If the temperature is less than or equal to 110°C, all heating circuits are turned ON.

**Figure 29:** Temperature monitoring schematic for PCB.

---

### 4.2.2 Temperature safety medium
Temperature safety is implemented for the heating medium with the following thresholds:
- If the temperature exceeds 90°C, power is turned OFF.
- If the temperature is less than or equal to 80°C, all heating circuits are turned ON.

**Figure 30:** Temperature monitoring schematic for the heating medium.
Page 37
### 4. Safety  

#### Attention:  
This failure indicates a system issue: 
- Coolant flow disruption, for instance caused by a defective pump.  
- Air bubbles in the coolant system.  
- Leakage in the coolant system.  

**Recommendation:** Service should be contacted; this can cause permanent heater damage.  

---

### 4.2.3 Current Derating  
The system monitors the current levels and implements overload protection mechanisms:  

- **Condition:** I ≥ 30 A for t > 1 s.  
- **Reaction:** Overload detected, power decreased.  

---

### 4.2.4 Short-Circuit (Over Current) Detection  
A short-circuit or overcurrent event is detected based on immediate and ultrafast current monitoring.  

- **Condition:** I ≥ 80 A for t > 1 µs.  
- **Reaction:** Reset happens, leading to a start-up check.  
- **Note:** Reset = Start-up trigger and stop application.  

---

### 4.2.5 Long Time Over Current Detection  
This function detects sustained overcurrent events exceeding a specified threshold and duration.  

- **Condition:** I ≥ 32 A for t > 15 s.  
- **Reaction:** Reset happens, leading to a startup check.  
- **Note:** Reset = Start-up trigger and set HV_PTC_ON_Rq to OFF and back ON again.  

---

### 4.2.6 High Voltage Reading  
A permanent high voltage measurement reading is being conducted.  

- **Condition:** If the HV reading leaves the predefined range (e.g., 150V – 510V).  
- **Reaction:** The heater immediately turns off all heat circuits.  
- **Additional Note:** The corresponding error signal via LIN will be set accordingly.  

---

### 4.2.7 Interlock (HV)  
The Passive Interlock Loop monitors the connection between the HV connector and the heater.  

- **Concept:**  
  - If the HV connector isn’t connected to the heater, the vehicle’s ECU disconnects the module from voltage.  
  - The interlock signal within the heater carries a current of 100mA or less.  
  - The bridge can be realized at the HV connector or inside the LV connector, depending on the OEM concept.
Page 38
4.2.8 Start-up check.  
A Start-up check can only be executed if the voltage supply is in unlimited operating capability (e.g., >230V).  
After switching the heater on or performing a reset, the heater waits for a power request over LIN. Once a valid power request is detected, the heater executes a start-up check. During this check, the heater performs diagnostics to identify errors such as short-circuit in the hardware, leakage current, or open-load condition.  
During the start-up check, the heater does not produce output power corresponding to the heat request. The heater circuits are pulsed one by one, measuring the consumed current. If the measured current is outside of a defined range, the heater recognizes this condition as an overload or open load. This process is repeated three times, and the corresponding heater leg will not operate further. The remaining heater legs can continue to function normally. The LIN status of the heater changes to "HV_PTC_SHORTED."  

4.2.9 Short circuit detection.  
Short circuits are detected to protect hardware from damage, with heating-power switched off immediately after detection.  
When a short circuit is detected, the heater restarts and performs a start-up check to identify the defective heater leg.  
Should one or more defective heat circuits (shorted or open load) be identified, the heater compensates by adjusting its heating stage to the same or lower output power.  

4.3 PTC Safety Concept.  
The PTC-elements are designed to restrict the maximum achievable system temperature in a worst-case scenario. This protection operates independently of electronics, maintaining temperatures at a level the surroundings can reliably withstand.

**Figure 34: PTC self-protection.**  
The figure demonstrates R/T characteristics of the PTC resistor, including reference points such as nominal resistance (RN), minimum resistance (Rmin), and the resistance related to the temperature rise area.  

4.4 Isolation Failure Detection (vehicle side).  
Isolation failure detection requires the customer to connect the ground bolt to the vehicle chassis.  
The OEM must manage a watchdog within the vehicle capable of detecting isolation failures.
