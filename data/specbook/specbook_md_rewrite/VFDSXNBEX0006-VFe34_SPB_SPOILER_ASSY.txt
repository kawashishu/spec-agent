The spoiler is part of the exterior trim and ornamentation for the VF7 (VFe34S). 

2D drawing reference is available from TCE, with the part number: BEX71039000.

The spoilers are mounted on the tailgate of the vehicle (LH & RH) and have interference fits with the roof and glass systems.

The parts are made from un-grained plastics (PC-ABS 2810-R), as detailed in the colour and trim brochure: VFDSXNCVC2801 – VFe34S (VF7)_Appendix_8_Color and Material_Exterior. CMF requirement illustration provided below the image.

The components must perform under all conditions. The dimensions must remain stable, exhibiting no colour or gloss changes, nor any detrimental effects when exposed to extreme temperatures ranging from -40°C to +120°C.
