Page 10 of 29.  

**Materials**

Material and production-compliant design layout of the components is essential for avoiding production-related surface flaws or defects such as tool parting points, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, stress zones, etc. Material-compliant fits, curvatures, and corners should allow for visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces. Uniform and material-compliant run-out of component edges, corners, and ribs must be ensured.

The selection of concepts and production methods should facilitate homogeneous structures and grain structures. All visible and tactile zones must remain free of burrs, while correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts have to be secured. Components must be free of disturbing noise in contact with the environment at all temperatures and driving conditions.

Surfaces must comply with DINENISO 1302 standards. Suppliers must meet quality requirements defined in “VFDST00055300.” Coordination of form and surface should involve corresponding samples including Cubing reports and Appearance Approval reports according to VFDST00038400 (Color matching/Appearance Approval and VDA 280 part 1). These reports should be submitted to VinFast’s approval offices. Matching parts from the supplier must adhere to timelines established by the matching department.

**Variants**

There should be one variant for all vehicle models.

**Interfaces**

The parts package must account for all tolerances in component parts and assemblies such as the body, cooling pack, front axle carrier, bumper beam, front bumper, and heat insulation. Components must ensure functionality in combination with all adjoining systems and interfaces.

**Performance Specification**

**NVH and Driving Comfort**  
The VINFAST targeted system for the Front End Module (GOR) is based on reference vehicles. The design of the Front End Module system and its structure, including the Reinforcement Front Bumper, must eliminate visible vibrations and mode shapes across the entire speed range (0 km/h – Vmax). Structural stiffness must account for engine excitation and wind (aerodynamic) excitation.

Components involved in aero acoustics must remain burr-free from manufacturing processes, though exceptions may be granted if approved by the function specialist. All fixation points, such as bolts, clips, and rivets, must be sealed airtight unless explicitly allowed by the function specialist.
Page 11
Component must be mechanically stable up to the highest possible speed range. No deformation of the component is allowed. Flat surfaces must be supported by an appropriate stiffening structure underneath. The component must remain stable over its lifetime. No deformation or shrinkage due to temperature, moisture, dirt, or UV radiation is allowed. Adhesion properties of the glue must remain as specified.

The supplier must ensure that components are free from disturbing noises within the vehicle environment. The system must not generate any disturbing noises (e.g., relative movement, wind noise, squeak, rattle, temperature effects, torsional flexing) during operation.

### Vehicle Safety
The supplier is responsible for actively supporting the integration of vehicle safety functions. Lifetime relevant laws, ratings of selling markets (Vietnam), and OEM requirements must be considered.

#### Specific Demands:
- Support pedestrian protection through the development of deformation characteristics.
- Up to five local module load cases will be defined by VF.
- An example of one module load case could be deformation X-resistance between KN-span at specific YZ positions.
- An UN-R21 pendulum device with specified mass and speed shall be considered as an impactor; impact energy details will be provided by VF.

#### General Demands:
- Vehicle safety functions must be optimally prepared at the system level with expertise, CAE data, and testing.
- Project-relevant supplier data must be provided to VF upon request, free of charge.
- Spread effect performances must be validated by an adequate number of worst results from identical test series.
- Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand to support vehicle data freeze milestones. Models must be created using LsDyna and must be numerically and physically validated.
- Finite Element Analysis (FE) meshes must adhere to part axles/geometry guidelines, with a mesh density of 8-10 mm. Non-compliant meshes must be revised.
- Validated CAE material cards must be developed and tested by the supplier, which includes system and component tests.
- Supplier test matrices must align with full vehicle timing demands. Optimization test series must be conducted before higher scaled tests (e.g., sled or vehicle crash tests).
- Supplier-specific parts required for testing at any stage of the project must be provided to testing facilities free of charge.
Page 12
Component must be mechanically stable up to the highest possible speed range. Flat surfaces must be supported by an appropriate stiffening structure underneath. The component must remain stable over its lifetime, with no deformation or shrinkage due to temperature, moisture, dirt, UV radiation, or other factors. Adhesion of glues must stay within the specified limits. Suppliers must ensure that components are free of disturbing noise in the vehicle environment. Disturbing noise caused by relative movement, wind noise, squeak and rattle, temperature effects, or torsional flexing must be avoided during all operations.

**Vehicle Safety**
Suppliers are responsible for supporting the integration of vehicle safety functions actively, considering laws, ratings in selling markets (Vietnam), and OEM requirements.

**Specific Demands:**
- Development of deformation characteristics for pedestrian protection needs to be supported.
- Up to five localized module load cases will be defined by VinFast.
- Example of a load case: deformation X-resistance between KN span in a specific YZ position.
- UN-R21 pendulum device with particular mass and speed as an impactor must be considered; further details on the impact energy are provided by VinFast.

**General Demands:**
Suppliers must adhere to the following points unless further specific definitions are provided:
- Vehicle safety functions must be maximally supported at the system level with expertise, CAE, and testing. 
- Supplier data relevant to the project must be delivered upon VinFast’s request and without charge.
- Performance targets must be validated, ensuring spread effects through adequate test series repetitions.
- Part/system CAE models must be available on demand in LsDyna; they must be validated and numerically/physically stable.
- FE meshes must conform to part axes/geometry guidelines with a density of 8-10mm; revisions must be made if guidelines aren’t followed.
- Activities for validated CAE material card generation (testing system/components) must be performed and funded by suppliers.
- Testing matrices should be aligned with the full vehicle timing requirements; optimization test series at the supplier’s end must be completed before scaled tests (e.g., sled or vehicle crash) are conducted.
- Test parts for any project-related testing must be freely provided by suppliers; cost demands for physical parts/CAE models must be managed by the supplier.
- Requests arising from vehicle crash optimization processes at VinFast (e.g., material definitions, changes in thickness, additional components) must be accepted without additional costs.
   
**General Requirements Include:**
- A 20% safety margin applied to all target values.
- No edges below 3.2mm during and after impacts within the occupant survival area integrity.
- Electrical system integrity pre-impact and in post-crash functions.
- Robust target achievement with consideration for tolerances.
- Investigating asymmetric scenarios for both sides to confirm reliable worst cases.

**Specific Demands Continued:**
Additional requirements may be pointed out:
- Observed issues must result in tracking actions by concerned parties for components/data/CAE models from further suppliers.
- Required equipment such as test bucks, sled setups, etc., should be prepared by suppliers using unfinished parts like non-prepped body-in-white (BIW).

Suppliers must prepare homologation and/or certificate documents for targets achieved totally/partially at the system level. Documentation is to be provided to VinFast free of charge. System requirements fulfillment for carry-over components can be demonstrated with donor vehicle performance data.

**Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability)**
Suppliers must ensure sufficient operational strength for intended, vehicle-specific conditions (operating loads and special events). Product-typical characteristics should be verified based on the application profile. All requirements to ensure strength at the complete vehicle, subsystem, and component levels must be defined (used as the basis for technical specifications).

**Operational Loads:**
Defined by benchmarking vehicles on VinFast-selected tracks, operational loads must reflect intended vehicle use. Usage testing reflects the customer's desired mileage target, which is 160,000km.
Page 13
Special events: Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approximately less than 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, such as ABS-braking. The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.

Weight Management: Because the vehicle weight has a big influence on the energy consumption of the vehicle, the major goal of weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight. Throughout the whole development, attention must be paid to a weight-optimized design of all components. All weight reduction potentials must be shown by the supplier, along with their impacts on cost, timing, and quality.

Vehicle Dynamics & Fuel System Integration: To enable sufficient brake cooling, the openings at the Front End Module must meet functional requirements as defined by Heat Management & Powertrain Cooling, Aerodynamics, and Chassis Module. The requirements have been aligned and checked in the Styling Technique Convergence meetings.

3.3 Testing and validation and DVP&R: DVP and PC test responsibility follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for System, Sub-system & Component Levels must align with the Complete Vehicle Specification book in the concept phase. A detailed test plan for hardware tests is filed in DVP&R and must align with Testing & Validation department activities:

- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (provided as a project plan).
- Part variant description of the component.
- Number of tested components/parts.
- For PPAP, material data sheets (MDS) in IMDS according to IMDS Rules and Guidelines IMDS 001 and IMDS Recommendations 002-122 are required. Updates are mandated for changes.
- Material data sheets must be provided by the supplier to VinFast IMDS-ID 214435.

Mileage Target: Ensure target life of 160,000 km or 10 years, whichever comes first. Refer to DVP VFDSXXBEX1158.
Page 14
3.3.1 Test plan. 

The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. 

For tests, the B2P SUP is contracted.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. 

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed. 

The B2P SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the B2P SUP site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast/B2P SUP.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone on the costs of B2P SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned, and the retesting has to be paid by B2P SUP if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).
- Part variant, description of the part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The B2P SUP is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by the VF testing department. 

The B2P SUP has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage. 

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. Upon request, the B2P SUP must use a test plan for each single component.

3.3.2 Test plan example.

DVP has to be weekly updated with the following points by the supplier.
Page 15
### 3.3.3 Testing

#### 3.3.3.1 General
The B2P SUP must provide a detailed testing plan on time, in consideration of the vehicle timing chart. It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant is tested. To prevent double testing, mechanical and electrical tests must be combined wherever possible.

The supplier must download the VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC. Unless otherwise expressly agreed, all sample part shipments must include a measurement report.

The component developer is responsible for ensuring compliance with all relevant legislations for their components and guaranteeing adherence to all internal VF requirements specified in performance criteria.

All test results must be documented with accompanying photos in the reports and submitted to VF. Law obligations for all target markets must be fulfilled. Documentation of tests should follow VinFast standards unless B2P SUP standards are agreed upon.

The B2P SUP must evaluate and conduct tests across development phases and submit results in the required DVP&R template as an attachment to the offer. Samples for sample inspections must be available on time or by agreed deadlines as coordinated with the test department.

To coordinate forms and surfaces, corresponding samples must be presented by the B2P SUP at VinFast approval offices along with the Cubing report and Appearance Approval report (refer to VF Standard Color Matching/ Appearance Approval VFDST00038400). Matching parts must be prepared by B2P SUP—timing will be coordinated by the matching department.
Page 16
### 3.3.3 Testing

#### 3.3.3.1 General
The B2P SUP provides in-time a detailed testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart. It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested. To prevent double testing, mechanical and electrical tests must be combined as far as possible.

The supplier must download the VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC. Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. The component developer must ensure compliance with all relevant legislations related exclusively to their component. Furthermore, it must be guaranteed that all internal VF requirements outlined in the performance specification are fulfilled.

Test results must be documented with photos and committed to VF. All relevant target market law obligations must be achieved. Tests should be documented according to VinFast standards or, alternatively, using B2P SUP standards if accepted by VF.

The B2P SUP must evaluate and perform tests for all development phases as per the specification. Tests must be formatted into the required DVP&R template (as an enclosure to the offer). Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time or by the agreed deadline as coordinated with the test department. Corresponding samples must be presented at approval offices with Cubing reports and Appearance Approval reports as outlined in VF Standard Color Matching / Appearance Approval (VFDST00038400). Matching parts, with provided timing, must be presented by B2P SUP as managed by the matching department.

#### 3.3.3.2 Release by Test Departments
The responsible VF test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved during the complete vehicle integration tests. Positive test reports for all required tests outlined in DVP&R must be submitted by B2P SUP. If any problems occur (negative results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), a test report addressing issues and proposed solutions must be presented to keep milestones and observe targets.

The first page of the report must clearly state an OK or NOK result.

#### 3.3.3.3 Analyses and Test Reports
The B2P SUP must provide measurement reports (VFDST00008900) in electronic format, which include agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during prototype generations. After individual tests, the test samples must be analyzed in detail. Measurements and test results must be proven through individual values and documented in a detailed test report. Reports must be submitted to the responsible VF department for release.

3.3.3 Testing.

3.3.3.1 General.  
The B2P SUP provides a detailed testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart. It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested. In order to prevent double testing, mechanical and electrical tests must be combined as far as possible. The supplier has to download the VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC. Unless otherwise agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. The component developer must assure compliance with all relevant legislations for their component while ensuring that all internal VF requirements outlined in the performance specification are met.  

All test results must be documented with photos and committed to VF. Relevant target market law obligations must be achieved. Tests must adhere to VinFast standards, or B2P SUP standards if accepted by VF. The B2P SUP is responsible for evaluating and performing tests using DVP&R templates and for ensuring scheduled availability of samples for inspection.  

In order to coordinate form and surface, samples must be submitted by B2P SUP and evaluated at VF approval offices according to standards including Cubing reports and Appearance Approval reports (e.g., VF Standard Color Matching/Appearance Approval VFDST00038400). Matching parts must be present from B2P SUP; timing is managed by the matching department.

3.3.6 Archival storage of tested parts.  
Test parts may only be scrapped with approval from the VinFast test department. Upon demand, all testing documentation—including reports and descriptions of parts—must be provided.

3.3.7 Virtual testing.  
The B2P SUP is responsible for using detailed calculation methods and models for component performance evaluation, ensuring optimization and compliance with specifications. FEM calculations are required for mechanical properties such as strength and dimensional stability. Injection molding dimensions are to be optimized through simulations. Calculation models must be shared upon request with VF departments for internal integration work.  

The B2P SUP must provide FEM models without additional costs upon request. Calculative documentation (e.g., FEM) of tests performed during evaluation must be completed before tool dimensioning.

3.3.8 Component testing.  
Required testing will be defined in the DVP and agreed upon between VF, VinFast, and B2P SUP. Compliance with DVP is mandatory.

3.3.9 Mechanical integration tests.  
The mechanical integration tests include:  
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100).  
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800).  
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000).  
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600).  

No distortion or functional disturbance is permitted across the whole functional temperature range in accordance with VTS standards. Behavioral consistency is required when using materials with varying thermal expansion coefficients.
Page 18
The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded. If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department have to be provided by the B2P SUP free of charge.

### 3.4 General CAE Requirements
Refer to SOR:  
**VFSRXXCVC0201**  
**DSUV_Appendix_2_CAE_FEM_General requirements**

### 3.5 Material Requirement & Corrosion
#### Prohibited or Restricted Substances, Emissions & Toxicology
The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification have to be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier through the complete product life cycle according to **VFDST00007601**.  

IMDS material data sheets have to be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID according to the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and **VFDST00007601**.  

Specific targets on vehicle indoor air quality are defined according to:  
**VFDSXVCVC3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline**

#### Corrosion Classification
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.

#### Additional Material Requirements
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  

Water and dirt accumulation must be avoided; always provide drainage in the lowest positions.
Page 19
Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements.  
Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.  
Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.  

### Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

**Component test for Metallic surfaces:**  
- Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.  

**For Organic coatings:**  
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.  

*Alternative tests possible, if proposed by supplier and accepted by corrosion engineer.*  

#### Test criteria:
| Area                              | Corrosivity         | Metallic coatings               | Organic coatings               | Pass criteria             |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                 | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227            | 96 h → ISO6270 CH             | No red rust              |
| Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, Wet area | Medium | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust          |
| Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, Wet area | High/not visible for customer | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | CCT: See below           |
| High/visible, very high           | 720 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B + stonechipping protection where needed | See below |

#### Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:
- **Rust creep according to ISO4628-8:**
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1–2 mm.  

- **Blistering:**  
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  

- **Edge corrosion:**  
  - ≤ 10%.  

- **Weld seam corrosion:**  
  - ≤ 5%.  

- **Degree of rusting:**  
  - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).
Page 20
Stainless steel:  
Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion); in most cases, an insulating coating is needed. Test criteria for high visible parts: 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check especially areas with crevices. Execute component tests with assembled sub-systems, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

Aluminium parts:  
Aluminium parts in high visible areas have to be painted or anodized.  
- Test criteria Painted Aluminium: see test criteria for organic coatings.  
- Test criteria Anodized Aluminium: 480 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.  
Execute component tests with assembled sub-systems, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

Chromed metal parts:  
240 h NSS ISO9227 without base material corrosion.

Chromed plastic parts:  
CASS-Test According DIN EN ISO 9227 with the following durations:  
- 48h for Exterior.  
- 24h for Interior.  
Acceptance criteria: no surface defects.  
Additionally, 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.  

Electric parts:  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations.  

Material combinations shall be chosen to prevent galvanic corrosion. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.  
- Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness.  
- Use surface treatments on steel fasteners, ensuring long-term corrosion resistance and compatibility with other materials.  

The electrical components must be installed to avoid vibrations generating fretting corrosion.  
Terminals and connectors: Do not place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection for terminals primarily requires tightness. Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.
Page 21
Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Reason: corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.

**Prevention of stone chipping issues:**
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone-hitting risk, choose part materials and paint which have the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts which have edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle, deepen them so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.

**3.6 Traceability**
For part requirements follow specification please refer to VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

**3.7 Labeling of Parts**
Suppliers follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Need to make a figure for the position to stick the label on parts (position labels set up with pictures).

**3.8 Vehicle Architecture**
The complete vehicle must pass the requirements from the vehicle layout plans. All changes on parts and modules affecting the vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence of the vehicle must be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation. 

The definition and technical geometric specifications regarding complete vehicle dimensions in the interior and exterior are based on GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.

**Styling Technique Convergence:**
All changes on parts and modules, which are affecting the Exterior and/or Interior styling surfaces of the vehicle, must be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation. 

Part or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops must be provided by the supplier (e.g. tooling demands, assembly sequence), based on defined requirements from VF module leads. Technical input can be provided as office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.
