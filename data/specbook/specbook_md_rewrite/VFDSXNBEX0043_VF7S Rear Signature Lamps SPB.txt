3 Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions.

Description of the part.
Feature list has useful information. Rear lamp should meet regulations for LHD and RHD countries for both ECO and PLUS variants.

Functional Requirements.
The rear signature lamps are comprised of three separate parts: LH body side, RH body side, and tailgate lamp. These are part of the exterior in the lighting commodity for VF7 (VFe34) and use LEDs on both ECO and PLUS variants.

The tailgate lamp is mounted onto the tailgate, while the body side lights interface with the rear bumper upper and are mounted onto BIW (body side outer). There is one variant of tailgate lamp used in all markets and two variants of body side lamps. One variant is used for NAS markets, while the other is used in ECE and all other markets.
