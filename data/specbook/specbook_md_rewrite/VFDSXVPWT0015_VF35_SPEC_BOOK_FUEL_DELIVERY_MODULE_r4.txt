5.1.2 Function.

The main functions of the Fuel Delivery Module (FDM) revolve around safely and reliably distributing fuel to the engine. Additionally, the fuel system serves as a functional subsystem designed to manage the vehicle’s emissions, noise, and performance characteristics. The lifetime of the fuel system is projected to be either 15 years or 300,000 km, depending on which provides the longer usage period.

The fuel system should be designed for seamless installation in the vehicle, accommodating level measurement, filling, and safety devices. To ensure smooth integration into designated vehicle platforms, fuel tank and FDM suppliers are required to detail design criteria to avoid misinterpretations during development and production stages. Any changes or questions beyond the listed criteria must be communicated and agreed upon before implementing engineering modifications.

Performance specifications:
- Voltage (V): 13.
- Fuel pressure (kPa): 550 ± 20.
- Flow rate (L/h): 90.
- Electric current (A): 10.
- Deadhead pressure (kPa): 700–950.

Environmental influences:
The FDM must operate flawlessly under various environmental conditions, satisfying performance requirements in the following:
- Underbody temperatures ranging from -40°C to 90°C.
- Engine compartment temperatures reaching 140°C.
- Exhaust tunnel temperatures up to 130°C.
- Relative humidity levels between 1% and 100%.
- Barometric pressure spanning 55 kPa to 105 kPa.
- Precipitation rates as high as ≤4.6 mm/min.
- Electromagnetic interference levels of ≤18 [V/m], spanning 0.1 – 18,000 [MHz].
- Exposure to ozone concentrations ≤0.40 ppm.
- Fuel tank interior temperatures of ≤80°C.

Carry-over usability:
The functional essence of the entire fuel system is its capacity to serve as a carry-over system, meaning components used in the system can be shared with existing units utilized in other vehicles or under development for other vehicle projects.

Durability considerations:
The Fuel Pump Module (FPM) must exhibit resilience against environmental factors such as humidity, temperature variations, ultraviolet radiation, and corrosion. These factors are prevalent in standard vehicle operations throughout the complete vehicle lifespan. Additionally, the FPM must adapt to heat influences from the vehicle's exhaust system, nearby road surfaces, and other external environments, ensuring continued performance reliability.

### 5.1.2 Function  
The primary function of the Fuel Delivery Module (FDM) is to distribute fuel reliably and safely to the engine. Additionally, the fuel system is a functional subsystem responsible for managing the vehicle’s emissions, noise, and performance characteristics. The fuel system is built to last for 15 years or 300,000 km, whichever is the longer lifespan.  

#### Key Design Requirements:  
1. **Installation and Safety**: The fuel system design should ensure proper level measurement, filling, and safety mechanisms. Suppliers must define design criteria for vehicle integration to prevent misinterpretation during development and production. Changes beyond listed criteria must be pre-approved prior to implementation.  

2. **Operational Conditions and Compatibility**:  
   - Voltage: 13V  
   - Fuel Pressure: 550±20 kPa  
   - Flow Rate: 90 L/h  
   - Electric Current: 10 A  
   - Deadhead Pressure: 700-950 kPa  

#### Environmental Conditions and Durability:  
The Fuel Pump Module (FPM) must meet performance requirements under various environmental conditions, including:  
- Exterior temperatures ranging from -40°C to 90°C.  
- Interior fuel tank temperatures ≤80°C.  
- Relative humidity levels from 1% to 100%.  
- Barometric pressures between 55 kPa and 105 kPa.  
- Precipitation rates ≤4.6 mm/min.  
- Electromagnetic exposures ≤18 V/m, between frequencies of 0.1 – 18,000 MHz.  
- Ozone levels ≤0.40 ppm.  

The module must consider heat influences from vehicle exhaust systems, road surfaces, and operating conditions and continue to perform reliably without defects.  

---

### 5.1.3 Fuel Storage  
The fuel tank should provide an effective usable volume of approximately 65 liters. Vented expansion volumes must be 4±1% of nominal liquid volume. Non-useful volume should not exceed 0.5 liters and must be tested according to SAE J398 standards.  

---

### 5.1.4 Fuel Flow  
The FDM is designed to deliver fuel to the engine and perform volume detection to manage performance, durability, and NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) characteristics.  

#### Design and Development Goals:  
- Reliability: The FDM design should prevent emission issues and meet all market-related minimum requirements.  
- Emission compliance: The fuel subsystem supports regulatory compliance.  
- Functionality: The fuel pump effectively draws fuel out of the tank and delivers it to the High-Pressure (HP) pump inlet.  

The fuel pump is required to achieve initial pressurization of 5.1 bars to deliver 0.4 liters, accounting for atmospheric pressure but not factoring in line pressure.

Page 13
5.1.5 Durability  
The safety-related components and systems should not fail throughout the life of the vehicle. This demonstration can be performed either on component or subsystem-level tests. The test must represent a severity level corresponding to 300,000 km for extreme customers, often referred to as 99th percentile customers.  

5.1.6 Thermal Influences  
Safety-related systems or components shall provide 20 years or 300,000 km of service, whichever occurs first. The ageing temperature shall be calculated for each system or part considering 99th percentile worst-case scenarios related to drive patterns, ambient conditions, and market(s).  

5.1.7 ESD/EMC  
All metal parts must be grounded due to ESD concerns. The fuel system or any of its components shall not, under any circumstances, show any tendency to charge with static electricity to a level that could cause a discharge. Components should be designed and tested according to SAE J1645. Lines carrying liquid fuel or high concentrations of vapor must be safely separated from electrical cables and harnesses.  
FDM must comply with all EMC market requirements.  

5.1.8 Fuel Quantity Sensing and Signal Accuracy  
The Fuel Tank Assembly, together with the Fuel Pump Module (FPM), must detect the fuel level and provide proportional signals of the stored fuel quantity throughout the vehicle’s lifetime.  
The FTFP Assembly must be designed to ensure the fuel quantity signal meets the following precision demands during both initial and soaked fuel tank conditions:  
- ±1.5 liters between 0% and 20% of full capacity.  
- ±3.0 liters between 20% and 80% of full capacity.  
- ±1.5 liters between 80% and 100% of full capacity.  

Detection accuracy requires the vehicle condition to be stationary and level within ±0.5°. The FPM’s floater height must adapt to fuel volume changes ranging from 3.5 liters to the possible refueling volume of the 3rd Nozzle Shut Off plus an additional one liter, accounting for both initial and soaked conditions. Accordingly, electrical resistance varies depending on the fuel volume change.

6.4 Controlling the Fuel Pump Controller (FPC)

This document describes the signal input and output for the fuel pump controller (FPC).

### Normal Operation:
- The frequency of the PWM signal is 100 Hz (±20 Hz). A PWM signal outside of this frequency band shall be considered invalid.
- The device must capture the PWM signal with an accuracy of ±1% (absolute value).
- <10% = fuel pump off
- 10% - 90% = normal operation mode
- >90% = maximum power
- Low-active → 0V means maximum power
- The module should stay alive at 2% duty cycle.
- The module should enter parameterization mode if the duty cycle stays at 5% for 100 ms (in case parameterization mode is available).

### Fault Diagnosis:
- The PWM signal from the engine electronics is suspended every 1000 ms, and the control device continues operating with the latest valid values until the PWM signal is restored.
- In the event that a fault is diagnosed, the control device sets the PWM line low for a duration corresponding to the fault. This duration is interpreted by the motor control device.
- If the engine electronics determine that the control device has not set the PWM line to low, the fault behavior continues for diagnosis accordingly.
Page 17
6.4 Controlling the FPC  
This section describes the signal input and output of the Fuel Pump Controller (FPC).

**Normal operation:**  
- The frequency of the PWM signal is 100 Hz (±20 Hz). A PWM signal outside of this frequency band shall be considered invalid.  
- The device must capture the PWM signal with an accuracy of ±1% (absolute value).  
- <10% = fuel pump off.  
- 10% - 90% = normal operation mode.  
- >90% = maximum power.  
- Low-active: 0V means maximum power.  
- The module should remain operational at 2% duty cycle.  
- The module should enter parameterization mode if the duty cycle remains at 5% for 100 ms (if parameterization mode is available). 

**Fault diagnosis:**  
- The PWM signal from the engine electronics is suspended every 1000 ms, and the control device continues operating with the latest valid values until the PWM signal is restored.  
- If a fault is diagnosed, the control device sets the PWM line low for a duration corresponding to the fault. This duration is interpreted by the motor control device.  
- If the control device has not set the PWM line low, the PWM signal continues for the next 1000 ms.  
- T_per = 10 ms.  
- The fuel pump module should detect the suspension of the fuel PWM signal which occurs every second.  
- The fuel pump module should switch the PWM signal to ground if error or status information needs to be sent to the DME.  
- Active errors or failures must be messaged cyclically to the engine electronics.  
- In case of multiple active errors or failures at the same time, one error or failure is to be reported sequentially. Only one error or failure per cycle is allowed to be reported.  
- If no errors or status information need to be sent to the DME, the fuel pump module should not switch to ground.  
- The switch-to-ground time (t_error = T_fault) should be configurable depending on the error or status feedback to transmit.

- In case of multiple active errors/failures at the same time, one after another error/failure has to be reported. Only one error/failure per cycle is allowed to be reported.
- The fuel pump module should not switch to ground if no error or status information should be sent to DME.
- The switch-to-ground time (**t_error = T_fault**) should be codeable and depend on error/status feedback to transmit.
- The module should transmit only one specific error depending on priority and sequence order during one feedback cycle.

**Parameterization Mode:**
- Before the first run, there is a parameterization mode to set up the communication.

**General Electrics:**
- **I_typ = 20mA.**
- **I_max = 30mA.**
- Another PWM signal transports the crash signal to the fuel pump.

6.5 Crash PWM Signal to FPC.

The signal is generated by an airbag control unit and sent to the Fuel Pump Controller (FPC). In case of a crash, the FPC can quickly be stopped to prevent fuel from being pumped into the crash zone.

**Signal Details:**
- The signal is a low-active PWM signal:
  - **UBatt** (electrical high) → logic low.
  - **GND** (electrical low) → logic high.
- The FPC is able to recognize the following cases and react in a capable manner:
  - Open line detection is implemented.
  - Short cut to UBatt is detectable.
  - Short cut to GND detected.
- The PWM signal operates at a level of 12 V.
- The FPC handles two basic frequencies:
  - **100 Hz ±20 Hz.**
  - **1000 Hz ±200 Hz.**
- The used frequency must remain consistent.

**Duty Cycles:**
1. **20% GND / 80% UBatt → Normal operation mode.**
2. **50% GND / 50% UBatt → Normal operation mode + test mode.**
3. **80% GND / 20% UBatt → Crash.**

During normal operation mode, the PWM signal alternates between state 1 and state 2 every second.
