Materials

Material and production-compliant design layout of the components should help avoid production-related surface flaws/defects such as tool parting points/lines, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, and stress zones. Material-compliant fits, curvatures, and corners must allow visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces. 

Uniform, proportionally accurate, and material-compliant run-out of component edges, corners, and ribs must be ensured. Components must use concepts and production methods that facilitate homogeneous structures and grain layouts. Visible screw points, screw point covers, and dummy covers should be avoided.

Surfaces should remain free of burrs in the visual and haptic zones. It should not be possible to recognize other components through grilles, trim covers, indentations, joints, and cavities. The overall impression must remain neat and tidy. Correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts must prevent disturbance noise.

## Materials

Material and production-compliant design layout of the components for avoiding production-related surface flaws/defects, such as tool parting points/lines, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, stress zones, etc. Material-compliant fits, curvatures, corners, allowing visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces.

Uniform, proportionally accurate and material-compliant run-out of component edges, corners, and ribs. Selection of concepts and production methods to facilitate homogeneous structures and grain structures. Avoidance of visible screw points and screw point covers as well as dummy covers. Surfaces free of burrs in the visual and haptic zone. 

No view of other parts (it should not be possible to recognize other components through grilles, trim covers, indentations, joints, and cavities; ensuring a neat and tidy overall impression). Ensuring correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts with regard to disturbance noise. Free of disturbing noise and odor in contact with the environment at all temperature and driving conditions.

Surfaces must be designed per ISO 1302 [14]. Quality requirements for suppliers from production material comply with “N85065” [40].

To coordinate the form and surface, corresponding samples including the Cubing report and Appearance Approval reports (see VFDST00038400 [12] Color Matching/Appearance Approval and VDA 280 part 1 [47]) must be presented by the supplier to the corresponding approval offices of VINFAST. Timing from the supplier's matching department is required for matching parts.

## Vehicle Safety  
*(Content continues in subsequent sections.)*
Page 19
Cooperation with VINFAST vehicle safety department.
The supplier is responsible to support the integration of vehicle safety functions actively. Lifetime relevant laws and Ratings of selling markets as well as OEM requirements must be taken into account.

**Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability):**
Verification of design regarding operational strength of the complete vehicle and all sub systems. Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions. Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristic, derived from the application profile. Definition of all requirements to ensure sufficient operational strength of the complete vehicle, sub systems, and components (this technical specification is the basis for all system and component technical specifications). Mounting force must be lower than dismounting force.

**Weight Management:**
Because the vehicle weight has a big influence on the energy consumption of the vehicle, the major goal of weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight. Throughout the whole development, attention must be paid to a weight-optimized design of all components. All weight reduction potentials have to be shown by the supplier, also with their impact on cost, timing, quality, etc. The whole system must not exceed a weight target of:  
- C CUV: 16.50 kg

**Fuel Economy & Driving Performance:**  
Not relevant.

**Vehicle Dynamics & Fuel System Integration:**  
Not relevant.

**Vehicle Architecture & Ergonomics:**  
The complete vehicle must pass the requirements from the vehicle layout plans. All changes on parts and modules, which are affecting the vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence of the vehicle, have to be communicated to VINFAST immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation. The definition and technical geometric specification regarding complete vehicle dimensions in interior and exterior are based on GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.
Page 20
**Styling Technique Convergence**  
All changes on parts and modules, which are affecting the Exterior and/or Interior styling surfaces of the vehicle, have to be communicated to VINFAST immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.  
Part or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops have to be provided from the supplier (e.g. tooling demands or assembly sequence), based on defined requirements from VINFAST module leads. Technical input can be provided e.g. as office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.  

**Ergonomics**  
The complete vehicle must pass the ergonomic test based on VINFAST internal procedure. All dimensional and material changes that affect ergonomics on parts and modules have to be communicated to VINFAST immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.  
The final sign-off of all ergonomic targets will be completed in close cooperation with VINFAST, which is responsible for interior and exterior styling. VINFAST ultimately approves targets through evaluations using styling bucks.

### Test Plan
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VINFAST wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.  

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and the component lead engineer of VINFAST.  

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly during the testing phase, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.  

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the component lies with the SDS. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The SDS has to ensure that VINFAST receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VINFAST can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VINFAST and SDS.  

If testing was done with incorrect parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the cost of the SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned, and the retesting has to be paid for by the SDS if they are responsible for the failure.  

### Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with a declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirement.
