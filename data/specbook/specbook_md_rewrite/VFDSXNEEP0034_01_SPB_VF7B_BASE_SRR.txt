### 2.1 Purpose and Legal Binding
This version is legally binding.

This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard.

Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g., what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2, level 2 is applicable).

### 2.2 Language
This document is written in English.

All official project documentations must be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

### 2.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording
The following wording rules are used throughout this document:

- **Shall**  
The word "shall" is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.

- **Should**  
The word "should" is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.

- **May**  
The word "may" is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

3 General Project Guidelines

3.1 Development Scope Abstract.  
This document details the technical requirements of the short-range radar (SRR) used by VinFast in VF7 base. The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics.  
The Contractor ensures that the development of the components respect all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements.  
Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details have to be reported immediately.  
The contractor is a ‘System Development Supplier', with complete responsibility of the supplied system within the system boundaries.  

3.2 Initial Situation and Objective.  
The objective is to provide all the necessary technical information requirements to develop a SRR for VinFast cars.  

3.3 Classification of the System / Component.  

3.3.1 Millimeter wave radar sensor.  
Millimeter wave (mmWave) is a special class of radar technology that uses short-wavelength electromagnetic waves. Radar systems transmit electromagnetic wave signals that objects in their path then reflect. By capturing the reflected signal, a radar system can determine the range, velocity, and angle of the objects.  

3.4 Execution Regulations.  
The supplier must ensure that the developed parts meet the requirements of the laws and of the specified requirements of VinFast, obtain the type certification of the parts, and submit all necessary documents to support the type certification of the whole vehicle. When synchronous development is completed, suppliers need to provide the necessary documentation to prove that their products have met the required regulatory requirements.

3 General Project Guidelines

3.1 Development Scope Abstract  
This document details the technical requirements of the short-range radar (SRR) used by VinFast in VF7 base.   
The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics.

The contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements.

Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details must be reported immediately.  

The contractor is a ‘System Development Supplier’ with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

3.2 Initial Situation and Objective  
The objective is to provide all the necessary technical information requirements to develop an SRR for VinFast cars.

3.3 Classification of the System / Component  

3.3.1 Millimeter wave radar sensor.  
Millimeter wave (mmWave) is a special class of radar technology that uses short-wavelength electromagnetic waves. Radar systems transmit electromagnetic wave signals that objects in their path then reflect. By capturing the reflected signal, a radar system can determine the range, velocity, and angle of the objects.

3.4 Execution Regulations  
The supplier must ensure that the developed parts meet the requirements of the laws and specified requirements of VinFast, obtain the type certification of the parts, and submit all necessary documentation to support the type certification of the whole vehicle. When synchronous development is completed, suppliers need to provide the necessary documentation to prove that their products meet the required regulatory requirements.

6.2.1 Elements of Systems

6.3 SRR Functions

6.3.1 Short Range RADAR  
The Master and Slave SRR detect obstacles at the rear of the vehicle by transmitting microwaves that are converted into electrical signals after encountering obstacles. These signals are sent to the SRR Master on the right side. The SRR Master processes the collected data, calculates the obstacles, and obtains relevant distance and position information. This information is transmitted to the instrument and HMI via the CAN bus. The HMI speaker provides a sound alarm, and the HMI displays the obstacle information.  

The system has a self-checking function. When a fault is detected, an audible alarm is issued, and the corresponding fault is displayed on the HMI.  

| Function | Function Description | Scenes to be Used |
|----------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| BSD      | SRR Master and Slave sensors detect obstacles in the BSD range of the vehicle's heading. The SRR Master transmits distance and warning information to the HMI. | There is an obstacle in the near range of the vehicle BSD zone. |

7.1.2 Vehicle Testing.
1. Vehicle Alarm Function Test.
Primarily through integrating the DBC communication matrix, we simulate various alarm scenarios to monitor whether the alarm signals meet the expected criteria. The detail please the BSD test report.

2. BSD Test.
Primarily, it simulates the motion trajectories of the ego-vehicle and the target vehicle to confirm whether the radar detection is normal and whether the alarm meets the customer's requirements. The detail please the BSD test report.

3. Calibration Test.
Primarily, it is to confirm whether the site calibration and after-sales dynamic calibration functions meet the customer's requirements. The details please the SRR test report.

8 SRR Calibration.

8.1 Radar supports EOL calibration and after-sales (AS) calibration.
1. In the production line or AS change new radar, the AS calibration will start automatically.
2. In the plant, turn on the hazard light for at least 5 seconds, it will turn to EOL calibration, whether the hazard light is on or not.
3. When the EOL calibration starts, it should be finished in 80 seconds, or it would trigger the time-out function, and the calibration would be turned to AS calibration and clear the process. If you want to start EOL calibration again, just turn on the hazard light again for 5 seconds.
Page 34
4. In the After-Sales (AS) market, a clear command must be sent by OBD in the following cases:
   - The radar has been calibrated but needs to be recalibrated due to movement or re-installation.
   - The radar has an angle error DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code), which requires recalibration after the issue is resolved.

Note 1: If the new radar sample does not receive a trigger command, it will automatically undergo after-sales calibration.

The specific calibration process is shown in the following figure.
