The controlling of the test results must be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SUPPLIER must deliver the needed parts free of charge.

Test procedures and documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The SUPPLIER bears responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the component. Testing must be scheduled in due time to ensure approval and/or retesting in case of negative results within the committed schedule. The SUPPLIER has to ensure that VinFast receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the SUPPLIER site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast/SUPPLIER. 

If testing is performed with incorrect parts, missing parts, or different procedures, the testing must be redone at the SUPPLIER’s expense. In case of negative test results, the tests must be re-planned and retesting carried out at the SUPPLIER’s cost when they are responsible for the failure.

### Data to Include in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- Description of how testing was performed and testing setup devices (with pictures).
- Identification of the responsible test department.
- Specification of where testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in the form of a project plan).
- Part variant description.
- Number of tested components/parts. 

The SUPPLIER is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by the VinFast testing department. The initial data must be filled out by the SUPPLIER and submitted to VinFast within four weeks after nomination of the SUPPLIER.
Page 16
The SUPPLIER has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype stage (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage. In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SUPPLIER. The DVP&R has to be agreed upon between the test department (VinFast), SQA (VinFast), and the SUPPLIER before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SUPPLIER has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule. Upon request, the SUPPLIER draws up a test plan for each single component.

### Testing

#### General
The SUPPLIER prepares, in time, a detailed, backdated testing plan considering the vehicle timing chart (refer to Chapter 4.17). It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested. To prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests must be combined as far as possible.

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SUPPLIER must be stated in the quotation of the SUPPLIER in any case and ordered from VinFast by the SUPPLIER. Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (coordinated with the test department). Even manual samples can provide sufficient information in certain cases. Measures can thus be introduced in time in the event of assembly problems to ensure the install ability of the test parts. 

VinFast “Logistics” determines the number of sample parts, and VinFast “Purchase” orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.
Page 17
Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SUPPLIER must be included in the SUPPLIER’s quotation. These parts must also be ordered from VinFast by the SUPPLIER.

The SES must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level as well as test reports of all required tests in compliance with the DVP&R. Disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SUPPLIER.

CAD data models in compliance with VinFast requirements must be provided promptly to enable virtual sample manufacturing. The SUPPLIER must present corresponding samples for form and surface approval to the respective VinFast offices. These samples must include a Cubing report and an Appearance Approval report (see VF Standard Color matching / Appearance Approval N 85030).

Functional Responsibility

Corrosion classification requirements for components in the system are as follows:
1. Corrosivity Low:
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

2. Corrosivity Medium:
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

3. High Corrosivity:
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. Very High Corrosivity:
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations must be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur, including fasteners and attached brackets. When critical material combinations are present, proper coatings such as paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers must be added. It is imperative to avoid water and dirt accumulation by providing drainage where possible and avoid dirt traps. Contact surfaces to the body should be dry and made of non-abrasive material. Adequate edge coverage and burr-free edges are necessary.

**Corrosion Tests:**
The parts must pass system/component tests as well as complete vehicle corrosion tests:
- Component testing for metallic surfaces:
  - Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria apply.
- Component testing for organic coatings:
  - Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria apply.
  
Alternative tests may be proposed by the supplier and must be accepted by the corrosion engineer.

5.8 NVH and Driving Comfort.

**General:**  
The VinFast target system for the Rear Quarter Window is orientated on reference vehicles. The gas and water tightness are the basics for acoustical tightness and must be appropriately and sufficiently achieved. The system must not cause any kind of disturbing sound (relative movement, wind noise, squeak and rattle, temperature, flexural torsion, etc.) during any operation. All possible appropriate measures must be taken to prevent operating noises (e.g., wind noise and whining noise) completely or absorb/deaden them to the greatest extent possible to achieve acceptable noises.

Squeak and rattle (S&R) effects which may occur during high-speed driving of the vehicle, also particularly at certain humidity levels, must be avoided by means of a suitable profile design and by choosing the right surface coating process of an appropriately high-quality material pairing (material matching) that offers adequate durability. The NVH team may assist in choosing material pairing to minimize noises like buzzing, squeaking, and rattling.

All components concerned with the seal system are to be designed with respect to the reduction of aerodynamic resistance and optimum aeroacoustic characteristics. To demonstrate the elimination of disturbing noise, the requirements must be coordinated with the responsible VinFast NVH-testing team.

**Additional functional characteristics and technical requirements:**  
- Determine the window’s thickness in cooperation with VinFast—dimension of glass thickness must be kept like reference vehicles (3.85 mm).  
- The rear quarter window must guarantee sufficient sound insulation from the environment—audio warnings and acoustic signals (e.g., sirens) must be audible.  
- Material, surface, and shape of the individual components must not impair the function of adjoining components, including the process-related tolerances of the complete rear quarter window and the BIW/doors (independence of tolerances).

**The supplier has to guarantee:**  
- No amplification of wind noise and vibrations on BIW/doors.  
- Avoiding of noise caused by the function of components or by joints due to unfavorable tolerances.  
- No whistling, buzzing, squeaking, and rattling noises during high-speed driving.  
- All the functions must be fulfilled over the whole operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).

5.9 Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability).

- Ensure sufficient operational strength concerning the intended vehicle-typical operational conditions (operating loads and special events).  
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile.  
- Definition of all requirements to ensure sufficient operational strength of complete vehicle, subsystems, and components. (This technical specification forms the basis for all system and component technical specifications.)  
- Mounting force must be lower than dismounting force.  

**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads refer to the loads that occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the base reference vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast.
