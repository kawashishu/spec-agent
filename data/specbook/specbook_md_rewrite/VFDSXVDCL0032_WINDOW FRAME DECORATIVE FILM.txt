5.1.5.19 Geometrical Integration.  
RPS (reference position system): The classification of the testing range occurs in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. An RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to occur within the RPS-system VFDST00000011 [34] as defined by the interior and BIW-department.  

Tolerance analyses:  
● Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.  
● Thermic change tests under all climate conditions.  
● Consideration of thermal expansion.

5.2 General CAE Requirements.  
N/A.  

5.3 Material Requirement.  

**Generally:**  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position must be classified for each component in the system:  

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   This is the default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   This is the default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity.

**Additional Material Guidelines:**  
● Material combinations must prevent galvanic corrosion. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. For critical material combinations, proper coatings must be applied (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  
● Avoid water and dirt accumulation. Always provide drainage at the lowest positions.  
● Prevent dirt traps where sand can act as an abrasive and damage the painted body through micro-movements.  
● Contact surfaces with the body must be dry, large enough for low pressure, and composed of non-abrasive materials.  
● Minimize micro-movement.

**Test plan:**  
The testing timeline, necessary devices, and methods are documented visually with consistent status updates. Validation engineers must approve all procedures and results. The supplier is required to provide necessary test parts free of charge for verification if requested by VinFast.
Page 23
The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the component lies with the “SDS”. The testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The “SDS” must ensure that “VinFast” receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that “VinFast” can attend any testing at the “SDS” site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between “VinFast” and “SDS.”

If testing was conducted with incorrect parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, testing must be redone at the cost of “SDS.” In case of negative test results, the tests must be re-planned, and the retesting must also be paid for by “SDS” if they are responsible for the failure.

### Following data must be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirement.
- Description of how and with which devices the testing was performed, including testing set-up photos.
- Responsible test department.
- Location where testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (presented in a project plan).
- Part variant and description of the part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The “SDS” is required to use the draft “DVP&R” provided by the “VinFast” testing department. Initial data filling must be completed by the “SDS” and submitted to “VinFast” at least four weeks after the nomination of the “SDS.”

The “SDS” must plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage. The sequence of testing and the number of test specimens must be determined in collaboration with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of “VinFast.” The test plan must be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible “VinFast” departments and the “SDS.” 

### Agreement Process:
The DVP&R must be agreed upon between the test department (“VinFast”), the SQA (VinFast), and the “SDS” before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delays, the “SDS” must deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule. 

Upon request, the “SDS” draws up a test plan for each single component.

### Test Plan Example:
The DVP must be weekly updated and include the following points:
Page 24
6.1.4 Testing  
6.1.4.1 General  
The “SDS” prepares, in time, a detailed backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.17).  

It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested!  
To prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.  

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the “SDS” have to be stated in the quotation of the “SDS” and ordered from VinFast by the “SDS.”  

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.  

Parts needed for testing activities at the “VinFast” test department must be provided by the “SDS” free of charge.  

The component developer must assure all relevant legislations for his component. Additionally, it must be guaranteed that all internal “VinFast”-requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled.  

All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to “VinFast.”  

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved.  

All tests must be documented according to “VinFast” standards or alternatively to “SDS” standards.  

The “SDS” has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification.  

The tests have to be included in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.  

Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time, or no later than the agreed date (as coordinated with the test department).  

Manual samples can provide sufficient information in certain cases. Measures can thus be introduced in time in the event of assembly problems to ensure the installability of the test parts.  

“VinFast – Logistics” determines the number of sample parts, and “VinFast - Purchase” orders the parts.
Page 25
A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. Development parts or partial body structures which are necessary for testing at the “SDS” must in any case be stated in the quotation of the “SDS” and must be ordered from “VinFast” by the “SDS”. The “SDS” must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the “SDS”.

CAD data models in compliance with “VinFast” requirements must be provided in time for virtual sample manufacturing. In order to coordinate the form and the surface, corresponding samples have to be presented by the “SDS” at the corresponding approval offices at “VinFast” with Cubing report and Appearance Approval report (see VF Standard Color matching / Appearance Approval VFDST00038400). Matching parts have to be present from “SDS”  timing will be provided by matching department. Matching parts to be provided from “SDS” free of charge (measured and marked acc. “VinFast” Standards).

Marking of sample parts according VF Standard VFDST00008700.  
Preparation of measurement reports according VF Standard VFDST00008900.

6.1.4 Testing  
6.1.4.1 General:  
The “SDS” prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.17). It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested. To prevent double testing, mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.  

Development parts or partial body structures which are necessary for testing at the “SDS” must in any case be stated in the quotation of the “SDS” and must be ordered from VinFast by the “SDS.” A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.  

The “SDS” must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. CAD data models that comply with “VinFast” requirements must be provided in time for virtual sample manufacturing.  

Corresponding samples to be presented by the “SDS” must comply with VF Standard for color matching/appearance approval (VFDST00038400). The samples provided free of charge must meet the reference points and evaluation system according to VF Standard VFDST00008300 from sample parts.  

Between VinFast and supplier, the following test procedures are defined:

The SDS is required to submit positive test reports for all required evaluations according to DVP&R. In case of issues such as negative test results or incorrect testing procedures, the SDS must submit an investigation report, attend to problem-solving efforts, and deliver proposal solutions to ensure milestones and targets are met.
Page 27
6.1.6 Analyses, test-reports.  
The SDS must provide measurement reports according to VINFAST specification (VFDST00008900) [43] in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts. After the individual tests, the test samples must be analyzed in detail.  

The measurement and test results must be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report must be handed over to the responsible VINFAST department for release.  

Upon request, the results, together with the documentation of the tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development), must be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests carried out parallel to series production must be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.  

6.1.7 Test-report/-information.  
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (part no., change index, materials, production process, additives like grease, and every deviation from approved serial process).  
- All parts must be labeled with description.  
- Document the reason for testing, in case of negative test results, and attach earlier test reports.  
- Perform testing with exact naming of the testing standard, norm, legal requirement, or exact description of the agreed testing procedure.  

6.1.8 Documentation of result.  
- Short description of the results (pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of result OK/NOK, pictures of the parts in testing position, etc.).

6.1.11 Mechanical integration tests.  
The following tests will be performed as mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle:  
- Climatic change test (VFDST00008400).  
- Sun simulation for trim parts (VFDST00008600).  
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000).  
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00008500).  

Basically, no distortion and no functional disturbance within the whole functional temperature range (-35°, +85°) is allowed. In particular, the behavior must remain stable even when using materials with high and varied thermal expansion coefficients.  

It must be verified in additional testing whether an exception to the temperature range or the working time sequence is needed for the coming home light.  

The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.  

These outlined component tests are basic required tests. Detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP, which must be agreed upon between “VinFast” and the “SDS” and will be binding.  

If “VinFast” orders parts for testing independently, the detailed descriptions of the parts must be attached.  

Parts required for testing activities at the “VinFast” test department must be provided by the “SDS” free of charge.
