1. General Document Guidelines.

1.1. Purpose and Legal Binding.  
This version is legally binding.  
This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard. Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other. All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g. level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).  

1.2. Language.  
This document is written in English.  
All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.  

1.3. Obligation of Requirement Wording.  
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.  

- **Shall**  
  The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.  

- **Should**  
  The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.  

- **May**  
  The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.  

### Requirements Traceability:
#### Requirement Table
| Requirement Number | Requirement Text           | CONFIG |
|---------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| REQ-IDNBR-VER      | Requirement Text need      | Criteria  |

Remark: Text for example guidance, not binding criteria.

- **REQ Categories**:
  - GEN – Generic application, non-specific.
  - PROJ – Project-specific examples: VF35, VF36, VFe35.
  - IDNBR – Unique Identification number, marked with ID (letters, e.g., EL from exterior lighting) and numbers ranging from 0001 to 9999.
  - VER – Version of the requirement, marked with .01 to .99.
  - CONFIG – Configuration criteria.

### 4.3. System Diagram

**Figure 1: CCU System Diagram**

The CCU System Diagram represents the flow and control of various temperature and air distribution processes in the vehicle. Key inputs include ambient temperature, in-cabin temperature, solar sensors, driver target temperature, and co-driver target temperature. These parameters feed into the ERL Driver (Front Left Driver) and ERL Co-Driver (Front Right Co-Driver), which operate in a range of 0-255.

**Recirculation flap control and discharge temperature control**:
- Recirculation Flap Control is determined by the average ERL value.
- Discharge Temperature Control regulates:
  - **Temp Flap (FL ERL) Driver** 
  - **Temp Flap (FR ERL) Co-Driver**
  - Compressor Control which impacts EVDC PWM and the clutch.
  - Cooling Power controls the air-conditioning system.
  - Heating Power influences heat generation.

**Blower Control**:
- Blower Control is managed by the average ERL value, leading to blower PWM signals.

**Air Distribution Control**:
- Air Distribution Control, also determined by the average ERL, manages the following requests:
  - Face Request
  - Foot Request
  - Defrost Request
- These requests adjust the Air Distribution Flap to achieve desired airflow.

The diagram highlights the relationship between environmental and user-driven inputs and how they interact with system functions to maintain optimal comfort.
