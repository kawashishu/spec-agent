**Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT:**  
- **Rust creep:**  
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.  
- **Blistering:** Blister size max. S2 (DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  
- **Edge corrosion:** ≤ 10%.  
- **Weld seam corrosion:** ≤ 5%.  
- **Degree of rusting:** ≤ Ri 1 (ISO 4628-3).  

**Stainless Steel:**  
Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion). In most cases, an insulating coating is needed.  

**Test Criteria for High Visible Parts:**  
720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check especially areas with crevices. Execute component tests with assembled sub-systems, where possible, and positioned as installed on the vehicle.  

**Aluminium Parts:**  
- **Painted Aluminum:** Follow organic coating test criteria.  
- **Anodized Aluminum:** 480 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Perform tests with assembled sub-systems as installed on the vehicle.  

**Chromed Metal Parts:**  
240 h NSS ISO 9227 without base material corrosion.  

**Chromed Plastic Parts:**  
- **CASS-Test:** DIN EN ISO 9227, duration:  
  - 48 h for exterior.  
  - 24 h for interior.  
  - Acceptance criteria: No surface defects.  
- **240 h NSS ISO 9227:** No surface defects.  

**Electric Parts:**  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes must be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (e.g., type Gortex) in wet locations.  

- **Material Combinations:**  
  Galvanic corrosion must be avoided. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. Use corrosion-resistant surface treatments for steel fasteners compatible with other materials.

- **Electrical Component Positioning:**  
  Vibrations must not generate fretting corrosion. Ensure terminals and connectors are not placed at the lowest points. Protect electrical connections from humidity.  

- **Groundings:**  
  Grounding connections must be water-tight in corrosive environments.

**Aluminum/Sealing Surfaces:**  
Avoid using aluminum alloys with copper and iron content > 1% for components with sealing surfaces due to the risk of corrosion penetrating seals, allowing moisture entry.

Prevention of stone chipping issues:  
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:  
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.  
- Enlarging radii of parts in high risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.  
- In areas of high stone hitting risk, choose part materials and paint which have the same colour, to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.  
- Avoid developing parts which have edges pointing in the vehicles’ driving direction.  
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them, so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.  

### 3.13 General CAE Requirements  
Please refer to:  
- SOR: VFSRXXCVC0201  
- VFCAE-001-FEM-GENERAL_Analysis requirement  

### 3.14 Material Requirement  
**Prohibited or Restricted Substances, Emissions & Toxicology:**  
The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification have to be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelve parts and spare parts by the supplier through the complete product life cycle according to VFDST00007601.

Suppliers must adhere to VinFast standard VFDST00000010. The supplier must provide figures illustrating the position of labels on parts, with images demonstrating label setup.

### 3.17 Appearance Approval - Applicable for All Visible Parts
Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401, which outlines the required quantity of parts and timing. Suppliers are responsible for submitting parts to VinFast for Quality Design following agreed timing to receive approvals for OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR.  
The process begins early in the PT build phase to secure AAR approval at LS milestone.  
Suppliers must include this activity in their development process and ED&D costs.

### 5 Testing and Validation and DVP&R
Testing responsibilities for DVP and PC are defined by RASIC. Testing must cover virtual and physical evaluations of systems, sub-systems, and component levels in alignment with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase.  
Suppliers must develop a detailed test plan in the DVP&R file and collaborate with the Testing & Validation department. Requirements include:
- Testing with declarations of standards, norms, and legal requirements.  
- Detailed descriptions of testing devices and setups, accompanied by pictures.  
- Specification of testing locations (internal or external).  
- Timeline and duration of testing (presented in a project plan format).  
- Detailed part variant descriptions.  
- Number of tested components or parts.

8 Supplier responsibilities.  
The supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements:**  
**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

**Spare Parts Support Cycle:**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall not be shorter than 10 years after VINFAST starts production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.  

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts:**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).

Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).  

10 Insurance / Warranties.  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).  

11 VinFast GTC & Part Packaging and Incoterms.  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition, Part packaging requirements, and Incoterms requirement in the RFQ package.  

12 Appearance Approval Process.  
The Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is applicable to suppliers to supply components affecting CMF appearance that requires VinFast Approval prior to PPAP deliverables. This report verifies that the VinFast Design Quality has inspected the final product and it meets all the required appearance specifications for the design. Harmony review is significantly important to ensure the components quality or state of being homogeneous with adjacent parts.  

Design Quality requires all suppliers to submit non-commercial value sample parts. Suppliers are required to submit complete assembly parts known as purchase parts (P-level) and child parts known as component parts (D-level). The quantity parts to be submitted as follows. Refer VFDST00038401 for details.
