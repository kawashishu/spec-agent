b) Production process of magnetic asphalt damping pad:
- Stock plan → Melt → Rabbling → Rolling → Overmold → Blanking → Magnetizing → Packaged product.

3.5 Traceability.
For part requirements, follow specification. Please refer to VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

3.6 Labeling of Parts.
Suppliers must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. A figure indicating the position for stick labels on parts needs to be created (position labels set up with pictures).

3.7 Testing and validation and DVP&R.
Testing validation will follow RASIC, including DVP (virtual and physical testing) for the System, Subsystem, and Component Level in line with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase. Suppliers will need to collaborate with the Testing & Validation department.

Detailed Test Plan:
- Testing with the declaration of standards, norms, and legal requirements.
- Description of testing setup, including pictures showing devices used.
- Location of testing (internal/external).
- Duration timeline flow for the testing (in project plan format).
- Part variants and descriptions.
- Number of tested components/parts.

Mileage Target Life:
Ensure that the testing validation meets the mileage target life of 160,000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first).

Reference documentation: DVP for Component VFDSXXDCL0115.
Page 11
### 3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.
AAR is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is described in the VFDST00038401, which specifies the quantity of parts and timing. For each step of the process, the supplier is responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design, following agreed timing with VinFast, to secure OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  
The process starts in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS. Suppliers should incorporate this activity into their development process and ED&D cost.
