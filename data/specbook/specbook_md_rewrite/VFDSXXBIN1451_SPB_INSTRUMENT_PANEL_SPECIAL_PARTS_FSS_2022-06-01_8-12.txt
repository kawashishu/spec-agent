**Component / System Description.**

The system developer for the IP Module commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:
- The assembly cockpit-specific requirements.
- The fulfillment of all VIETNAM laws and ratings of selling markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.

For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of development, the system developer for the IP Module must identify and clarify to the customer the impact on costs, quality, and time schedule in collaboration with the build-to-print supplier. 

The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all VinFast law requirements of selling markets acting or newly coming into force at the moment of commissioning and during the lifetime of the car family on the common platform. Suppliers shall also monitor ongoing changes in rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target.

The supplier delivers the complete cockpit assembled and the parts which are produced by the supplier directly to VinFast. The detailed assembly strategy must be developed with VinFast plant.

Add-on parts not included in the development range of the supplier have to be taken into consideration during the development of the assembly cockpit.

**Add-on parts include:**
- Instrument cluster.
- AC- / Heating-control unit.
- Electrical components.
- Steering column.

The glove box door, if located in the lower part of the IP, must not contact the legs of the passenger in the opening of the 50% percentile manikin.

**The following sheets and documentation must be provided for release:**
- 3D-CAD data.
- Drawings.
- Simulations for NVH.
- Quality regulations.
- Results / Documentation of test validation.
- Documentation of the FMEA (updated as needed).

All parts of the assembly must be matched to ensure that colors are equivalent, and the gap & step plan is fulfilled. Functional dimensions must comply with the prescribed requirements.

- Master Reference Point between IP main carrier and CCB is in Y=0.
- Input regarding the kind of fixation and stiffness is defined by SDS IP.
- Technical CCB specifications are defined in the spec book for CCB.

### Airbag Door

The airbag door contains an invisible breakup solution. The lid-carrier is horizontally divided, if possible symmetrically. If the supplier believes another airbag door solution better fulfills the requirements, the supplier is responsible for informing, presenting, and discussing the concept with VinFast.

- The split line must be invisible on the dashboard's skin (A-surface).
- Hinge lines should not leave marks on the skin.
- All break lines of the airbag door must be invisible; they may be cut using a cold knife or laser.
- Testing temperatures include room temperature (+20°C), low temperature (-30°C), and high temperature (+85°C), along with all generator loads (Minimum/Nominal/Maximum load). Tolerance for testing temperatures is ±2.5°C.

VinFast proposes including an airbag shooting channel at the IP's backside using vibration welding, ultrasonic welding, or infrared welding. If the supplier can develop an injection-molded dashboard with an integrated shooting channel, it is acceptable, provided there is no visible split line on the dashboard's A-surface and all other specified requirements are met.

#### Development Targets
- No separate door for the passenger airbag.
- The integrated airbag door must be securely attached to the dashboard to avoid tearing off.
- There must not be any risk of injuries to occupants due to the instrument panel or airbag door during or after deployment (collision or secondary collision).

#### Opening Force Requirement
- The opening force of the airbag door must be agreed upon with the airbag supplier and specified in the production drawing. The maximum opening force should not exceed 2.3 kN.
- Refer to the appendix of the subsystem technical specification for the safety and restraint system validation program applicable for all development phases.

**Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:**

To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided via the diagnosis interface or central data interface for pyrotechnical components. The following requirements must be met:
- Enable sequential deployment of all components to avoid noise and pressure peaks and allow a check of deployment per component.
- After deployment of pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that are classified as toxic waste or hazardous substances according to valid waste legislation. If such residues exist, components must be dismantled and disposed of separately.
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components must be immediately and clearly visible through acoustic or direct vehicle feedback or feedback from the deployment tool.
- Marking positions of pyrotechnical components (especially "hidden" components, e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest). 
- In cases of non-deployment, removal of pyrotechnical components is required. Pre-dismantling should be avoided if technically possible, ensuring accessibility of fasteners.

**Recycling:**

**Recycled Materials:**
When selecting materials, focus should be on reducing the variety of materials and ensuring compatibility with proven recycling technologies. Secondary raw materials such as post-consumer and post-production recycled materials (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics) must be prioritized to ensure availability on the market. These recycled materials must be marked according to part marking standards and reported to the environmental compliance team at VinFast.

**Recycling Scheme:**
This chapter outlines project-wide requirements for the recycling and repair scheme for component development:
- Parts and components must be designed for recycling to enable cost-effective recycling at the end of life.
- The contractor must provide a simple layout for the recycling process of components, including details of preferred recycling partners and cost estimations.
- The recycling scheme must be submitted to the environmental compliance team at VinFast before the PTO production try-out milestone.

2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/ dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very high corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

**Corrosion Tests:**  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

Additional guidelines:

- The Interior is usually considered a dry area with low corrosivity; exceptions might include floor areas or regions prone to wetness/abrasion caused by shoes or liquids, which could produce corrosion.
- If combining different metals, galvanic corrosion should be avoided by coating such components.
- Edges, especially painted ones, must be burr-free to ensure good edge coverage and avoid wear.
- **Seat structure (uncoated/blank steel):** New parts must be corrosion-free, ensuring risk areas are not visible to customers and establishing full functionality over lifetime.
- **Vehicle tooling:** Generally stored in the trunk, considered to have low corrosivity exposure. Tooling surfaces with wear may have medium corrosivity exposure.

RPS (reference position system): The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. A RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS-system and VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28] according to interior- and BIW-department.

#### Tolerance Analyses
Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms.
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.

#### Interfaces
The components must be designed such that the function is guaranteed in combination with the adjoining systems.

The interfaces must be worked out in cooperation with VinFast in consideration of a quality method (e.g. FMEA, risk filter).
