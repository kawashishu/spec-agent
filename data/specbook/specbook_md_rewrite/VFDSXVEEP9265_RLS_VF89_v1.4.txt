1 General Document Guidelines.

1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.
This version is legally binding. This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard. Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g., what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English. All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document:

- **Shall**  
  The word "shall" is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.  

- **Should**  
  The word "should" is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.  

- **May**  
  The word "may" is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g., what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English. All official project documentation has to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document:

- **Shall.** The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.  
- **Should.** The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.  
- **May.** The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

5.2 Block and Principle Diagram.

5.2.1 Elements of Systems

5.3 Functions

5.3.1 Rain Sensor/Light Sensor/Solar Sensor/HUD Sensor

The rain sensor (RS) consists of two optical measurement tracks to detect wetting on the windscreen. Each one is composed of an IR emitting diode, an optical element, a coupling connection to the windscreen, and a receiving diode.

The optical element collimates the IR radiation on the emitting side. The geometry of the optical element is designed to meet the critical angle of total internal reflection of the windscreen surface. On a dry and clean windscreen, the IR radiation is totally reflected and focused on the receiving diode.

If rain drops hit the sensitive area of the measuring tracks, there will be optical contact between the windshield glass and the rainwater. As a result, the step in refractive index changes, and part of the IR radiation will be coupled out.

The amount of radiation detected by the receiving diode depends upon the condition on the windscreen. Raindrops on the windscreen cause the receiving signal to drop.

5.3.1.1 Master Block Diagram/Bus Topology

The diagram represents the connection flow:
- USER → DSB → SCM → BCM → RLS 
- "Hardwired" connections are depicted with blue arrows.
- "Body LIN1" connections are represented with green arrows.

### VinFast Management System

#### 5.3.1.2 Detailed Functions Description

##### 5.3.1.2.1 Rain Sensor Function
The RS system shall support the following functions:
- Activation AUTO Wiper Mode
- Wiper Park Position
- Wash Mode
- RS Sensitivity
- Transient Behaviour
- Confirmation Wiper
- Optical Initialization

###### 5.3.1.2.1.1 Activation AUTO Wiper Mode
**Requirement Number:** GEN-AU0001  
**Requirement Text:**  
The automatic wiper activation request by the driver is either the major signal to enable or disable the RS functionality. The activation method of the automatic wiper should be subjected to the HMI book.  

**System configurations:**  
- **NON-AUTO:** RS deactivated by selection switch in position other than auto position.  
- **AUTO:** RS activated by selection switch in auto position.  

**Bus Communication:** B+RS  

---

###### 5.3.1.2.1.2 Wiper Park Position
**Function availability in Vehicle States (ICE and BEV):**  
- **PARKED:** Wiper in park position.  
- **MOVING:** Wiper moving (i.e., not in park position).  

**Requirement Number:** GEN-WP0001  
**Requirement Text:**  
To ensure proper operation, the sensor needs to know when the wiper blades wipe over the RS sensitive area. During this time period, the sensor interrupts the evaluation of the measurements. Thus, the current parking contact status of the wiping blades has to be transmitted on the communication bus.  

**Bus Communication:** B+RS  

---

###### 5.3.1.2.1.3 Wash Mode
**Requirement Number:** GEN-WS0001  
**Requirement Text:**  
During wash mode, the RS interrupts the evaluation of the measurements. The current wash mode shall be available on the communication bus.  

**Bus Communication:** B+RS
Page 21
### Detailed Functions Description

#### **5.3.1.2.1 Rain Sensor Function**
The RS system shall support the following functions:
- Activation AUTO Wiper Mode
- Wiper Park Position
- Wash Mode
- RS Sensitivity
- Transient Behaviour
- Confirmation Wiper
- Optical Initialization

---

#### **5.3.1.2.1.4 RS Sensitivity**
**Requirement Number:** GEN-RS0001  
**Requirement Text:** RS sensitivity can be adjusted by the driver. The adjusting method should be subjected to the HMI book. The rain sensor shall support four levels of sensitivity. The sensitivity level defines the reaction in terms of wiper activation/deactivation thresholds and transient behavior. RLS shall use different sensitivity parameterizations for day and night.  
**System Configuration:** B+RS  

**RS Sensitivity Signal Values:**  
- **STEP 1:** Sensitivity Level 1 (least sensitive)  
- **STEP 2:** Sensitivity Level 2  
- **STEP 3:** Sensitivity Level 3  
- **STEP 4:** Sensitivity Level 4 (most sensitive)  

---

#### **5.3.1.2.1.5 Transient Behaviour**
**Requirement Number:** GEN-TB0001  
**Requirement Text:** Transitions are based on currently detected rain conditions, the selected sensitivity level, and wiping history stored by the rain sensor. The transient behavior defines the transitions between continuous wipe modes and other wipe modes. When a sudden, big increase of rain is detected, RLS switches to splash mode. In splash mode, the RLS changes directly into high-speed continuous wiping mode. After transition into the high-speed continuous wiping mode, the ordinary transition scheme follows.  
**System Configuration:** B+RS

5.3.1.2.1.6 Confirmation Wiper

Requirement Number: GEN-CW0001  
Requirement Text:  
After the RLS completes Optical Initialization, it shall send one time single wipe request to notify that RLS is well-initialized. If the vehicle's ignition state is “ON”, the vehicle speed was already >0 km/h in the current power cycle and the wiper switch is changed from “non-auto” to “auto,” the RLS will trigger a single wipe. If the vehicle ignition state is “ON,” the vehicle speed was already >0 km/h in the current power cycle, the wiper switch state is “Auto,” and the driver increases wiping sensitivity, the RLS will trigger a single wipe.  
CONFIG: B+RS

5.3.1.2.1.7 Optical Initialization

Requirement Number: GEN-OI0001.01  
Requirement Text:  
On first power on, the RLS will perform an optical initialization to calibrate itself to the vehicle’s windscreen. The optical initialization will be finished within the first 200ms after startup. However, if the wiper switch is changed from “non-auto” to “auto” more than 5 times in the beginning 10 seconds after power on, RLS will perform an optical initialization again. Optical initialization must be repeated when RLS is removed and reattached.  
CONFIG: B+RS
