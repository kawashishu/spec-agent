3 Additional Technical or Functional descriptions. 

For BEV vehicles, cooling hoses and pipes provide coolant flow. YA-992 is a mixture of ethylene glycol, unique inhibitors (i.e. organic acid salts, tolyltriazole) and water (~93.3% EG, 3.9% inhibitors, 2.8% water) used for DCDC, EDS (Electric Drive System), OBC (On Board Charger), and battery. The function of coolant hoses and pipes in a vehicle is to provide a flexible connection between moving components (e-motor) and fixed components in the car (radiator, expansion tank, pumps, etc.). The lines must permit the flow of coolant at high temperatures and must be flexible to absorb movements of the e-motor without ruptures, transmission of loads, or significant flow restrictions. These lines are shaped, and their sizes vary as per system requirements.

The cooling lines shall distribute coolant between the various components in the cooling and heating systems of the vehicle. It will circulate coolant in the system where it undergoes continuous pressure and temperature fluctuations. Therefore, the functional requirements for cooling hoses are important as listed below:
- The cooling tube assembly shall be secured with proper connections, clamps, and connectors to avoid any leakage from the pipe joints.
- Cooling lines must operate efficiently in a hot and stressful environment involving heat, pressure/vacuum, and blow-by gases—conditions that can induce rapid heat aging in many plastic and rubber materials.
- Flexible connections are required to isolate e-motor vibration and noise from the ducting system. The connections should be configured for maximum allowable offset and compression to prevent early failure and excess forces on the turbocharger and air inlet components.
- Certain hoses shall take up movement between the e-motor and other components in the cooling system. Cooling lines should be flexible such that they can withstand e-motor rolling conditions.
- The cooling lines must be cleaned of all debris. Pipe material should ensure that prolonged operation will not result in debris coming loose and entering the system.

### Temperatures and Pressures
The temperature of the coolant in the BEV E-drive and heating loops may range between -30°C and 95°C. The temperature of the ambient air may range between -40°C and 105°C. Normal working temperature is below 90°C. At soak, the ambient temperature could reach 105°C and coolant temperature 90°C. The pressure may vary from -10 kPa to 100 kPa overpressure.
