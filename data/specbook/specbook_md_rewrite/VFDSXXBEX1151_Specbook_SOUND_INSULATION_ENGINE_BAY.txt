- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000).  
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600).  

Basically, no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range according to VTS is allowed. In particular, by the use of materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients, the behavior has to be kept.  

The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.  

If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department have to be provided by the B2P SUP free of charge.  

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.  
AAR is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is described in the VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing).  

For each step of the process, Supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval. The process will start in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS.  

Supplier has to include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.  

4 Function Safety, Homologation, and safety regulations.  
Safety is one of the key issues in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety is concerned with E/E systems.
