Interior parts emissions (bag method).  
The emissions of interior components, semi-finished products/ auxiliary means, and surface materials (foils, artificial leather, films) have to be checked according to standard ISO 12219, part 2 ('bag method'). The fulfillment of a target value for interior part emissions according to this specification book has to be proved by the supplier via measurements defined by Vinfast.  

Harmful substances in components and materials.  
The emission behavior of the product has to be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment have to be minimized accordingly. Required measurements for confirmation of the emission characteristics must be done by the supplier in agreement with the specialist department of Vinfast. The measurements must be performed at testing institutes approved by Vinfast. It is recommended to obtain an overview of all approved testing institutes from Vinfast. Additional requirements can be found in project-specific documents (e.g., Emission Guideline).  

Volatile organic compounds of components have to be checked according to ISO12219.  
The conformance of prohibited substances has to be ensured through the complete product life cycle. The test result is evaluated by the specialist department of Vinfast. The supplier must attest in writing the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health. Measurement results of VOC and Fogging must be provided before milestone purchase release.

3.9.6 HC Emissions.

3.9.6.1 Fundamentals.  
Compliance with legal and client-specific emission standards, i.e., adherence to thresholds for the vehicle and specifications for the vehicle interior, must be guaranteed. The safety of volatile substances and compliance with VFDST00007601, VFDST00007602, VFDST00007604, "Hazardous Materials," is to be confirmed in writing. Development and series production aim at minimizing HC emissions. The respective current VinFast standards must be complied with during the service life.

The supplier must submit a component description "Component description for recording HC emissions" to the relevant design department as early as possible. At each change to materials or processes, the part description is to be updated. IMDS material data sheets and EC safety data sheets are to be provided to the quality department.

The supplier must carry out necessary measurements to prove emission properties in coordination with the Department of Plastics Development, process technology. Measurements are performed at test institutes recognized by VinFast. Current lists of recognized institutes may be obtained from the quality department.

3.9.6.2 Total HC emissions as per CARB.  
The scope of development described in this Requirements Specification (ZB seats rear including all adjoining parts) must be measured in new condition as per VFDST00031102. The target value for new condition is 4 mg for all rear seats. In subsided condition, emissions must not exceed 0.4 mg. Subsided condition starts one year after component completion and lasts through its service life.  

Supply thresholds for new condition and subsided condition applicable during the entire duration must be agreed with the quality and Design department. Test frequency must be determined.  

General note:  
If thresholds are expected to be exceeded in VFDST00031102 measurements, it is recommended to execute screening analysis of emissions for component or material optimization.

3.9.6.3 Volatile substances, sum of volatile substances, Odor.  
Generally, the following applies:  
Volatile substances of the development scope are to be tested using thermo desorption as per [8], formaldehyde determination as per [10], and odor as per [9]. Values established by complex and realistic measuring processes are decisive. Measurement grading of odor assessment as per [9] must be better or equal to grade 3, with no unpleasant odors.

4.12 Seat Assembly Sequence

1. The 3rd row seat back will be assembled first through the tailgate following the assembly of the 2nd row seats (fold and tumble condition).
2. During assembly, the 3rd row seat back should remain in the fold condition to ensure easy entry through the tailgate. Care must be taken to prevent major loads on the duct during seat adjustment for back mounting hole alignment with the floor for fastening. 
   - After tightening the mounting points (rear LH and RH, rear and front seat mounting), apply torque to all the bolts and unfold the seat back.
3. Once the back assembly is completed, the 3rd row carpet will be installed.
4. The 3rd row cushion will be entered through the 2nd row door, with the 2nd row seats in the fold and tumble position. The cushion will initially be inserted into the gap below the back foam biting area, then flipped downwards to engage the Halted clip.
