Noise caused by components or joints due to unfavorable tolerances must be avoided.  
For safety-relevant matters, proof of meeting legal requirements must be provided.  
Climatic requirements should adhere to MSF standards.  
Clips and screws shall be used for fastening.  
All components must function over the full temperature range.  
After a crash, parts must not become loose, and no sharp-edged break-ups are allowed.

### Materials  
Material and production-compliant design layouts must prevent surface flaws/defects, such as tool parting lines, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, and stress zones.  
Material-compliant fits, curvatures, and corners must allow visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces.  
Component edges and corners must have a uniform, proportional run-out.  
Concepts and production methods must facilitate homogeneous structures and grain patterns.  
Avoidance of visible screw points, screw point covers, and dummy covers is necessary.  
Surfaces in the visual and haptic zones must be free of burrs.  
Components must not reveal other parts—i.e., transparency through grilles, trim covers, or joints is unacceptable.  
Correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts must avoid disturbance noise.  
Designs must ensure freedom from disturbing noise and odor when in contact with the environment.  
Surface designs adhere to DINENISO 1302 [14].  
Suppliers must meet the quality requirements for production materials as per "N85065" [40].

Samples, including cubing reports and appearance approval reports (Color Matching/Appearance Approval, VFDST00038400 [12], and VDA 280 part 1 [47]), must be presented by suppliers for approval. Matching parts must also be submitted by suppliers according to timing from the matching department.

### **Vehicle Safety**  

**Cooperation with VinFast Vehicle Safety Department:**  
The supplier must actively support the integration of vehicle safety functions. Lifetime laws, ratings of selling markets, and OEM requirements must be fully addressed.  

#### **Specific Demands:**  
- As per protocols: **UN-R21**  

#### **General Demands:**  
- Comply fully with the required safety standards, laws, and vehicle-specific safety protocols aligned with customer specifications.
Page 13
Unless further specific definitions will be given, following points must be considered by the supplier.

- Vehicle safety functions must be maximum prepared by expertise, CAE, and testing at system level.
- Project-relevant supplier data must be handed over to VinFast on request free of charge. VinFast may forward this data to other project parties.
- Target fulfillment of performances with spread effects must be secured by adequate numbers of worst results from identical test series.
- Part/system CAE models must be provided, realized in LsDyna, validated, numerically and physically stable, to reach vehicle data freeze milestones.
- FE meshes must be homogeneous, adhere to part axes/geometry, with density between 8–10mm. Non-compliance with meshing guidelines requires mesh rework.
- Generating validated CAE material cards is the supplier's responsibility. Tests on system and components must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier.
- Supplier test matrix must align with VinFast’s vehicle timing demands. Supplier optimization test series should precede higher scaled tests (e.g., sled or vehicle crash tests).
- Specific parts required for project testing must be supplied without charge by the supplier to relevant testing facilities. Costs for physical prototypes and CAE modeling incurred by suppliers must be absorbed by them.
- Full vehicle crash process requests may necessitate additional factors like material specifications and optimization work without incurring extra cost to VinFast.
  
General Requirements:

- For each target value, a 20% mandatory safety margin applies.
- Occupant survival area integrity and part behavior include elements indirectly or directly contacting passengers.
- No edges below 3.2mm during or post-impact.
- Electrical system integrity during impact and for post-crash functions must be ensured.
- Tolerances and target robustness must be fully considered.
- Asymmetries require investigations on both sides for reliable worst-case validation by VinFast.
- No modifiers are permitted for any rating assessments.

Additional Specific Requirements:

- Tracking actions for observed issues must include providing parts, CAE models, and additional data promptly.
- Test devices (e.g., test bucks/sleds) must be developed using unfinished components, e.g., non-prepared BIW for sled tests.
- Homologation and/or certification documents for system-level target fulfillment must be provided to VinFast free of charge.
- Carryover parts/systems performance requirements can be substantiated through donor vehicle performance data.

### Additional Requirements
Not applicable.

### Material Requirements & Corrosion Requirements
Please refer to the VINFAST Request for Quotation.

#### Additional Requirements
**Interior Corrosion Requirements:**  
- Screws, bolts on Handles, mirror  
- Key  
- Seat belts  
- Trunk area  
- Seat structure  
- Invisible structural parts  
- Vehicle tooling  

#### General Requirements for Corrosion:
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosively position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosively Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosively Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosively:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosively:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

#### Corrosion Tests:
**The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.**

#### Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:  
**Fog Test:**  
ISO6270 CH. Acceptance criteria see below.
Page 24
Salt spray test is conducted based on ISO9227, with acceptance criteria defined below.

For Organic coatings, a cyclic corrosion test (CCT) is conducted based on ISO11997 Cycle B. Acceptance criteria are defined below.

Alternate tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

**Test Criteria:**

| Area                  | Corrosively        | Metallic coatings             | Organic coatings               | Pass criteria                  |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227          | 96 h → ISO6270 CH              | No red rust                   |
| Exterior              | Medium            | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227           | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust CCT: See below |
| High & not visible for customer / High & visible | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | See below                     |

**Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT:**
- Rust creep according to ISO4628-8:
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.
- Blistering:
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).
- Edge corrosion:
  - ≤ 10%.
- Weld seam corrosion:
  - ≤ 5%.
- Degree of rusting:
  - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

The interior is primarily considered a dry area with low corrosivity. Exceptions may include the floor area or areas affected by wetness/abrasion caused by shoes or drinking juices, which might produce corrosion. 

When combining different metals, avoid galvanic corrosion by coating such parts. Edges, especially painted edges, must be burr-free to ensure good edge coverage and avoid wear.

For the seat structure, uncoated blank steel must be corrosion-free at least for new parts. Areas at risk of corrosion must not be visible to the customer. Consider extreme positions of the seat rests.

Other invisible areas may have relaxed test criteria, but it is essential to ensure no visible corrosive products and maintain full functionality over the product lifecycle.

Vehicle tooling, typically stored in the trunk, is generally exposed to low corrosivity. However, tool surfaces subjected to wear may experience medium corrosivity.

**Test plan.**  
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VINFAST wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.  

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast.  

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly during the testing phase, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.  

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of its component lies with the SDS. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on a committed schedule. The SDS has to ensure that VINFAST gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VINFAST can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VINFAST/SDS.  

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the cost of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting has to be paid for by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.  

**Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:**  
- Testing with a declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.  
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).  
- Responsible test department.  
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).  
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of a project plan).  
- Part variant, description of part.  
- No. of tested components/parts.  

The SDS is responsible for using the DVP&R template provided by the VinFast testing department. The content of the DVP&R is the responsibility of the SDS.  

The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.  

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens must be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast.  

The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed upon between the test department SQA (VINFAST) and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.
Page 26
Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.

### Test Plan Example

### Testing
#### General
The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.16).

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level along with test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS.

### Release by Test-Departments
The responsible VinFast test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the SDS and during the complete vehicle integration tests. 

The SDS must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of problems—such as negative test results or incorrect parameters/processes—the SDS must submit a test report, present solutions upon request, and deliver proposals to maintain milestones and observe all targets.

An **OK** or **NOK** result needs to be stated on the first sheet of the report.

---

### Analyses and Test Reports
The SDS is required to provide measurement reports according to VinFast specification (VFDST00008900) [43] in electronic format, aligned with agreed measurement concepts for all parts.

After the individual tests, the test samples must be analyzed in detail. The measurement and test results must be proven by individual values and documented in a test report. The report must be submitted to the responsible VinFast department for release.

Upon request, the test results and documentation—covering tests carried out for initial sample inspections as well as inspections parallel to development—must be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests conducted parallel to series production are to be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.
