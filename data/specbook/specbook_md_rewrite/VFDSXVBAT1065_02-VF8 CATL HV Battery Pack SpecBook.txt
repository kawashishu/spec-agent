### **4.3 Discharge Current and Power Limit Tables**  

The BMS software continuously sends via CAN the maximum discharge current and power that the battery can support. The value sent over CAN is determined by the Current and Power limit tables, which outline limits based on temperature and SOC.  

The Current and Power limit tables serve as the basis for the BMS calculation of current and power limits transmitted via CAN. The BMS accounts for instantaneous cell voltages, temperatures, and SOH to calculate the actual current limits. As a result, the values transmitted via CAN will be lower than those listed in these tables.  

Additionally, further reductions are applied based on the previously used power by the vehicle and the BDU temperature.

---

#### **Figure 4.1 Pack Discharge Current Limit Table (A)**  

The figure displays the discharge current limit values based on varying conditions of temperature, pulse duration, and SOC levels. 

- **Conditions include:**  
  - Temperature ranges from -30°C to 50°C.  
  - Discharge durations of 10 seconds, 30 seconds, and continuous.  
  - SOC ranges from 5% to 97%.  

The discharge current limit table features specific current values for various pulse durations at different temperatures and SOC levels for optimized operation.  

For exact numerical values, please refer to Figure 4.1 in the table above.
Page 14
4.2 Pack Discharge Power Limit Table (KW)
The table visualized in Figure 4.2 presents the discharge power limits of the battery pack in kilowatts based on temperature and State of Charge (SOC). The limits are categorized into pulse durations (10 seconds, 30 seconds, and continuous discharge). The table highlights how power capability decreases gradually with dropping temperature and SOC levels, ensuring safe and efficient pack operation.

4.4 Charge Current and Power Limit Tables
The Battery Management System (BMS) software continuously sends on CAN the maximum charge current and power that the battery can support. This data is primarily used for the regeneration function of the electric vehicle (EV), while the specific charge request for DC fast charging is described in the next chapter.

Please note the following methodology:
1. The provided current and power limit tables establish baseline values for BMS calculations.
2. The BMS adjusts the reported limits by considering instantaneous cell voltages, temperatures, and State of Health (SOH).
3. Consequently, the actual limits sent on CAN will consistently be lower than those specified by these tables.

Additional considerations include:
- Derating based on past power use by the vehicle.
- Incorporating the BDU temperature impacts.

## 4. Product Overview

### 4.3 Discharge Current and Power Limit Tables
The BMS software continuously communicates via CAN the maximum discharge current and power that the battery can support. The value sent through CAN is based on the Current and Power limit tables, which provide limits based on temperature and SOC. 

Key notes:
- The Current and Power limit tables provide baseline values for the BMS calculation. However, the BMS adjusts these values based on instantaneous cell voltages, temperatures, and SOH (State of Health). Therefore, the actual values sent on CAN are often lower than those provided in the limit tables.
- Additional de-rating is applied, factoring in past vehicle power usage and the BDU temperature.

#### Figure 4.1: Pack Discharge Current Limit Table (A)
*A chart displays the maximum discharge current values segmented by temperature, pulse duration, and State of Charge (SOC).*

#### Figure 4.2: Pack Discharge Power Limit Table (KW)
*A chart illustrates the maximum discharge power limit values segmented by temperature, pulse duration, and SOC.*

### 4.4 Charge Current and Power Limit Tables
The BMS software also continuously communicates through CAN the maximum charge current and power that the battery can support. This data is specifically used for the EV's regeneration function, while details for DC fast charging are covered in subsequent chapters.

Key notes:
- As with discharge metrics, the Current and Power limit tables provide initial values that the BMS calculation adjusts based on cell voltages, temperatures, and SOH.
- CAN values observed may be lower than the table limits due to these adjustments.
- Additional de-rating is based on historical vehicle power use and the BDU temperature.

#### Figure 4.3: Pack Charge Current Limit Table (A)
*A chart displays maximum charge current values segmented by temperature, pulse duration, and SOC.*

#### Figure 4.4: Pack Charge Power Limit Table (KW)
*A chart shows maximum charge power limit values segmented by temperature, pulse duration, and SOC.*
Page 16
## 4.5 Charge Request Current Table

When charging, the BMS sends to the vehicle system the maximum charging current that the RESS can support. The values are sent on CAN based on the Current Charge Map.

Please note that the Current Charge Map provides the starting value for the BMS calculation of the current and power limits sent on CAN. The BMS will then take into account the instantaneous cell voltages, temperatures, and SOH to calculate the actual current limits. Therefore, the values sent on CAN are expected to be lower than the values observed in these limits.

There are also additional de-rates applied based on the BDU temperature.

### Figure 4.5 VF8 Current Charge Map (A)
The table displays the maximum charging current values sent by the BMS based on SOC (State of Charge) levels and temperature conditions. The data represents a matrix of varying current values (in Amperes) for temperature conditions from -20°C to 55°C across SOC levels ranging from 3% to 97%.

### 5.3.4 Venting Interface

There is a venting interface on the RESS. This device is called the air pressure equalization device (APED), and it includes an external vent pipe for this project. When the APED is not functioning, water may enter the RESS. If errors occur, such as leakage of cells or refrigerant leakage within the RESS, the APED serves as the degassing opening (EPED). As a result:
- The opening must remain unobstructed.
- Sufficient distance from adjacent areas must be maintained.
- It is important to note that the gases that escape may be very hot and flammable.

The venting interface specifications include the following:
- **Main Structure:** Al6063 + VQM + SUS304
- **Gas-permeable Membrane:** e-PTFE
- **Ventilation Capacity:** > 300ml/min @ 2.5 kPa
- **Burst Pressure:** 4 ± 1 kPa
- **Operating Temperature:** -40°C to 85°C
- **Thread Dimensions:** M5*18, 6 N.m
- **Flame Retardant Rating:** UL94-V0
- **Level of Protection:** IP68, IPX9K

The venting interface design ensures:
- Balancing internal and external pressure for the battery pack.
- Rapid gas exhaust in case of abnormal cell damage.

The venting interface is illustrated in Figure 5.7, which shows the location and design of the venting device on the RESS.

**Figure 5.7 Venting Interface**
The venting device is designed with considerations for safety and heat resistance, ensuring proper ventilation and gas release in the event of system failures.

5.3.5 Mounting interface.

The mounting interface of the CATL battery pack is designed to be compatible with the existing VF8 vehicle design, which has mounting points designed for the VinES/SDI battery pack.  

The mounting points in the side flanges and front corners are the same as the VinES/SDI battery pack.  

There are 8 mounting points in the middle of the battery pack:  
- 2 points in the middle area are the same as the VinES/SDI battery.  
- 6 points in the middle area are different. It was not possible to use the existing vehicle mounting points; therefore, a new bracket was designed to ensure compatibility.  

The detailed interface is shown in figure 5.8.  

Figure 5.8: Mounting interface.  

The battery pack also provides interfaces to mount the trust plate at the front, the gap hiders on the side, and the aero shield at the back of the battery pack.

The BMS thermal logic follows the requirements from the VF Battery team. The BMS sends a signal to the VCU to turn on/off the Chiller (Cooling) or PTC (Heating) based on the cell temperature min/max.  

Threshold values associated with these temperature boundaries are calibratable and subject to change.

### Thermal System and Logic

#### 7.2. Thermal Logic  
The Battery Management System (BMS) sends a signal to the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) with the required power request based on the difference between the Target Temperature (defined as 24 degrees, calibratable) and the Inlet Temperature.  

**Values below are calibratable and subject to change:**

- **Target - Inlet (°C)**
  - If the difference (Diff) ≤ -7, the power request for active cooling/heating is -7.5 kW and passive cooling/heating is 0 kW.
  - If Diff ≤ -6.0, the power request is -7.0 kW (active).
  - Diff ≤ -4.0: The power request is -4.0 kW (active).
  - Diff ≤ -2.0: The power request is -2.0 kW (active).
  - Diff ≤ 0: The power request is -0.2 kW (active). 
  - Diff ≥ 0.2: The request for passive cooling/heating begins from 0.2 kW.  
  - For heating, specific thresholds (e.g., 2 kW, 4 kW, and 7 kW) differ based on intensity required.

---

The BMS also sends a **flow rate request** to the VCU based on the difference between the pack temperature and inlet temperature.  

**Values are calibratable and subject to change.**

- Active modes and offline control thresholds are configured across charging systems, with yellow-highlighted values set as calibratable during specific conditions (e.g., periodic wake-ups and state-of-charge (SOC) checks).

---

#### System Modes for Chiller and PTC Operations
**Chiller ON/OFF conditions:**
- Active mode: During online operation, the chiller engages at cell temperatures above 32°C and disengages below 28°C. 
- For AC charge, operational thresholds may alter to initiate above 41°C.
- Offline mode triggers high-temp chiller operations beyond 40°C.

**PTC ON/OFF conditions:**
- Active mode: PTC is enabled for cell temperatures below specific thresholds during DC and AC charge periods.
- Preconditioning triggers PTC below -22°C, with calibrated thresholds for offline periods below -20°C.

---

#### Release Notes
The latest calibrations and configurations align with VF Battery requirements. Adjustable parameters maintain responsiveness for cooling or heating based on environmental conditions and operational needs.

### 7.3 Flowrate Request from BMS to VCU  

The flowrate request from the Battery Management System (BMS) to the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) is based on the difference between the pack temperature and the inlet temperature. The values listed below are calibratable and subject to change.  

#### Flowrate Request Values:  

- **Passive Cooling/Heating:**  
  - For temperature differences of -150, -100, -70, and -15, the requested flowrate is 24.  
  - At -10, the flowrate requested is reduced to 20.  
  - At -5, the flowrate reduces further to 15.  
  - At -3, the flowrate requested is now 11.  
  - At -2, the flowrate reduces to 8.  
  - At -1 and 0, the flowrate requested is 5.  
  - At 1, 2, and 3, the flowrate remains at 5 and 8 respectively.  
  - For differences of 4 and 5, the request increases to 12 and 15.  
  - For differences outside this range (10, 15, 70, 100, 150), the flowrate returns to 24.  

- **Active Cooling/Heating:**  
  - For temperature differences ranging from -150 to -100, the requested flowrate is 24.  
  - At -70 through -15, the flowrate requested remains at 24.  
  - For -10, the flowrate reduces slightly to 20.  
  - At -5, the flowrate reduces to 15.  
  - At -3, the reduced flowrate is 12.  
  - At -2, the flowrate requested is 10.  
  - For -1 and 0, the value remains at 10.  
  - For differences increasing from 1, 2, 3, and 4, the flowrate steps up between 10 and 12 respectively.  
  - For 10 through 150, the requested flowrate returns to 24.

### 8 Thermal Propagation and Runway Detection

#### 8.1 Thermal Propagation Design
The CATL battery pack has been designed to minimize the possibility of thermal propagation between cells. There is a gap between cells, and a thermal insulation pad is fitted. There is space for venting on top of the cell and a Mica protective layer.

**Figure 8.1** illustrates battery pack cell placement design with considerations for thermal events. Measurements in the drawing are indicative only and subject to change.

---

#### 8.2 Thermal Runaway Detection
In the CATL B sample packs, thermal runaway was detected by monitoring cell voltages, temperatures, and communication faults of the CSC. The list of conditions can be found below, with thresholds being calibratable.

### 8 Thermal Propagation and Runaway Detection

#### 8.1 Thermal Propagation Design
The CATL battery pack has been designed to minimize the possibility of thermal propagation between cells. There is a gap between the cells, and a thermal insulation pad is fitted. Additionally, there is space allocated for venting on top of the cell and a Mica protective layer.

*Figure 8.1* illustrates the battery pack cells placement design, considering potential thermal events. The measurements shown in the drawing are indicative only and subject to change.

---

#### 8.2 Thermal Runaway Detection
In the CATL B sample packs, the thermal runaway was detected by monitoring:
- Cell voltages.
- Temperatures.
- Communication faults of the CSC.

The thresholds used for detection are calibratable and depend on various conditions.

For the C sample design, VinFast requested the addition of a pressure sensor for thermal runaway detection. CATL incorporated a similar design in use with another OEM.

**Conditions to trigger the thermal runaway alarm** include combinations of:
- Voltage drops.
- Temperature rises.
- Time thresholds.
- CSC communication conditions.

The specific conditions to trigger thermal runaway detection are documented in the table above, with calibratable "xx" values for each setting.

**TR Pressure Sensor Design and Logic:**
- The TR sensor is integrated with the BMS hardware and powered by the vehicle’s 12V power supply.
- When the BMS is active, signals from the BPS are transmitted via SPI to detect any thermal issues.
- In sleep mode:
  - The BPS chip will retain the alarm until the BMS wakes up.
  - After waking up, the BMS evaluates the alarm to determine if a thermal runaway has occurred.
  - If confirmed, the BMS activates the VCU to alert the vehicle.

The working current specifications for the TR sensor are:
- **Case 1:** 200µA in sleep mode.
- **Case 2:** 250mA in active mode.

Thermal runaway testing was performed on both the B sample and C sample hardware levels.

### 12 Labels, Packaging, Transportation and Storage

#### 12.3 Transportation

The Battery Pack should be transported not fully charged, meeting the applicable legislation for mode of transport and location. During transportation, the battery pack should be prevented from violent vibration, shock, exposure to sunlight, rain, or any liquid during transportation, and it should not be inverted to avoid short circuits. 

In the process of loading and unloading, it should be handled gently, without dropping, throwing, rolling, heavy loads, or inversion. 

The recommended transportation temperature is between 0 to 40 degrees.  
- **If shipped by plane:** The RESS should be transported with SOC lower than 30%.  
- **For road or ship:** The RESS will be delivered with 40% SOC by CATL.

#### 12.4 Storage

The Pack shall be stored at **20%-70% SOC**.  
The requirements of product storage environment are as follows:
- **Limits for Storage temperature:** -40 °C ~ 60 °C  
- **Recommended storage temperature:** 0 °C ~ 40 °C  
- **Recommended storage humidity:** 10% ~ 85% RH  
- **Storage environment:**  
  - The battery should be stored in a clean, ventilated, and cool environment.  
  - Avoid exposure to sunlight, high temperature, corrosive gas, violent vibration, mechanical shock, and heavy load.  
  - Keep away from heat sources.

The duration for storage in dry and ventilated environments depends on storage SOC and self-discharge specifications.  

The battery packs in storage need to be checked and maintained every 6 months. The maintenance test methods during storage are as follows:
