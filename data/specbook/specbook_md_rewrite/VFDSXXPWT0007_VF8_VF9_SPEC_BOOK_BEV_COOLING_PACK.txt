### 3.1 System Description  
#### Major Components:  
- Battery Radiator  
- EDS Radiator  
- Fan with Fan Shroud  

#### Objectives:  
The objective is to minimize complexity and achieve high commonality. Suppliers should prioritize using off-the-shelf components rather than developing new ones.  

#### System Requirements:  
The cooling module must include pre-assembled components such as:  
- Fan  
- Fan Shroud  
- Radiator  
- Condenser  
- Carrier (if necessary)  

**Note:** The cooling assembly must be pre-assembled by the system supplier.  

**Image:** [Cooling pack illustration].
Page 7
Cooling Circuit:

The system developer commits to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process to achieve the purpose of the project. 

The technical and commercial release will proceed by the customer according to change management. 

The aim of the assignment is to have a validated cooling module for the BEV variants that support battery, EDS, and high-voltage component thermal requirements.

**3.2.1 System description**  
The major components are:  
- Fan  
- Radiator for EDS cooling  
- Radiator for Battery cooling  

The objective is to minimize complexity and achieve high commonality. Suppliers must prioritize the use of off-the-shelf components rather than developing new ones.
Page 8
The complete cooling module including the fan, fan shroud, radiator, condenser, and carrier (if necessary) should be pre-assembled by the system supplier.

### 3.1.2 Function
The cooling module is a functional subsystem designed to meet thermal management requirements, and each component should be verified according to the following criteria:

- **Fan:** Sufficient airflow should be provided at all driving conditions to support radiator heat exchange requirements.
- **Radiator:** Sufficient heat rate to air/coolant so that the coolant temperature after the radiator remains below 60 °C. Coolant composition should be 50:50 water and long-life antifreeze.

A general requirement for the air pressure drop is to minimize it across all heat exchangers to ensure large airflow with reduced fan power consumption and low fan discharge temperature.  

It is equally critical that only a lower grill is provided to support cooling performance. A generic grill opening requirement was agreed upon between teams to support this feature effectively. The cooling module supplier is tasked with developing the system based on these requirements.

### 3.1.3 System Requirements
The system supplier must define characteristic curves or values matching thermal requirements from the EDS, battery, and high voltage components. The fan design should ensure multi-speed control and performance via signals provided by the vehicle. Final versions will be defined during developmental phases.

#### Requirements:
- Airflow aligned with cooling system demands based on vehicle usage profiles for all components, media, and seasonal requirements.
- Geometry alignment.
- Efficient electrical power consumption.
- Compatibility with charge balance.
- Acoustics, vibration minimization, and resonance avoidance.
- Operational lifespan within expected usage profiles.
- Ease of service and repair.

#### Development responsibilities include:
- Creation of the concept system.
- Refinement of the package.
- Heat exchanger sizing.
- Airflow distribution evaluation.
- Prediction of heat exchanger cooling air mass flows.
- Identification and resolution of airflow leakage paths.

### Cooling Module Design
The grill opening projected area must cover more than 15% of the cooling module area to meet cooling performance requirements.
Page 9
- Evaluation of pressure loss of the cooling module.
- Evaluation of airflow uniformity.
- 3D simulation of the cooling module.
- 1D simulation of the cooling module.
- Provides flow rate data used as a boundary condition for the cooling system simulation.

Supported by the supplier:
- On-vehicle 3D simulation.
- Optimization of grille openings.
- Balance of cooling airflow requirements with front-end parts, such as bumper beams and license plates.
- Balance of aerodynamic performance with cooling airflows.
- Powertrain cooling system optimization.
- Facilitates system differences between markets.
- Sizing of coolant loop components such as pumps.

### 3.1.3. Radiator Requirements:
#### Performance Parameters:
- Ambient: 40°C
- Radiator Battery: Heat exchange requirement: 9-11 kW, Air pressure drop: 80 Pa, Coolant pressure drop: 18 kPa.
- Radiator for EDS: Heat exchange requirement: 12-16 kW, Air pressure drop: 80 Pa, Coolant pressure drop: 18 kPa.

Supplier shall meet the required performance and provide components performance data. Coolant flow for the simulations should be assumed to be 20-30 liters/min.

#### Radiator Design:
The radiator size should be determined by thermal requirements. It is advantageous for radiators to have the same width as other heat exchangers in the cooling module from a packaging point of view. 

Preferred radiator designs:
- I-flow radiators are preferred. U-flow radiators may also be used.
- Radiators must be equipped with POPP clamp connections according to DIN 3021-A XX, length 25 mm. Other alternatives may be considered upon supplier request.

#### Characteristic Curves:
- **Inner Flow Rate vs Pressure Drop:** Suppliers must define characteristic curves/values according to high voltage components.
- **Outer Flow Rate vs Pressure Drop:** Suppliers must design flow rates based on these requirements.
Page 10
System supplier has to define Characteristic curve/values matching to engine and powertrain.

Quantity of heat vs outer air mass flow and inner flow:
A cross-flow radiator with uniform mounting dimensions and net size areas as required is planned, and the design of the net size can vary according to performance requirements. The connection of the radiator is made to the condenser or a cooling package carrier.

Leakage:
No leakage is allowed at internal pressure of 160kPa.

3.1.3.2 Electric Fan Performance and Shroud:
The fan design provides controlled multi or variable speed to support cooling performance. The vehicle provides the speed signal. Final versions will be defined during the development work.

The following requirements must be fulfilled:
- Airflow must meet the requirements of the cooling system in relation to component temperatures and the cooling usage profile of the vehicle.
- Geometry.
- Minimum electrical power consumption (efficiency).
- Charge balance compatibility.
- Control required for continuously multi or variable speed, with possible follow-up after vehicle shut down.
- Acoustics, vibrations, resonances.
- Life expectancy according to the operational profile.
- Serviceability and ease of repair.
- EMC compatibility.
- Supports ISO 26262 standard.

**Page:** 11  

### Electric Fan Performance and Shroud  
The electric fan is an axial sucking (pull air) type, rated at 12V with multi-stage variable speed functionality and a maximum motor power of 320W.  

#### Characteristic Curves  
System suppliers must define characteristic curves and values matching vehicle overall resistance airflow. VinFast will control performance using simulations and complete vehicle testing.  
- **Air flow rate vs pressure loss:** To evaluate fan efficiency under varying conditions.
- **RPM (revolutions per minute):** Based on performance documentation criteria.

#### Temperature Profile  
A working fan must operate in ambient temperatures between -40°C and +115°C.  
- Measuring points should be placed at half the blade diameter (12, 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions) and 1 cm away from the controller, both before and after it. The mean value of these points will determine the temperature range.  

#### Temperature Requirements  
The fan system must withstand specific temperature ranges during its lifetime, as outlined below:  
| **Temperature Range (°C)** | **Part of Lifetime (%)** |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 70-79                      | 10                    |
| 80-89                      | 35                    |
| 90-99                      | 34                    |
| 100-110                    | 15                    |

These requirements are essential for ensuring fan reliability across various environmental conditions during vehicle operations.
