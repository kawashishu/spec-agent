# General Description of the System / Component

It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification are to be agreed between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:  
- The trim-specific requirements.  
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of selling markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.

For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, weight, quality, and time-schedule. The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to the change management process.

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of selling markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class B and C common platform. VINFAST will also monitor ongoing changes to rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.  

The supplier delivers the trim parts as a module (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated). Add-on parts not included in the development range of the supplier are to be considered as purchase parts. These add-ons include:  
- Electrical components.  
- COP parts.

For the documentation of the release, the following sheets and documents are necessary:  
- Drawings.  
- Simulations (e.g., mold flow analysis).  
- Quality regulations.

- General reduction of cost compared to predecessor models.
- Further improvement of acoustic, optical, and functional characteristics.
- Functionality has to be ensured within temperature range -30Â°C (-5Â°C for Vietnam market) till +85Â°C in areas above the belt line, and -30Â°C (-5Â°C for Vietnam market) till +85Â°C in areas below the belt line.

**Stiffness / Rigidity / Stability of Shape.**

- Especially in the area of the operating elements, the components and bracket design have to assure that no instability is noticeable.
- Irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, visible waviness under climatic change loads are prohibited.

**Trim Parts Requirements.**

No detaching, fracturing, or splitting of parts is allowed, neither at crash tests nor at airbag deployment, even not in the low temperature range.

DVP and PC test responsibilities follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for System, Sub-system, and Component Level must align with Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase. A detailed test plan for hardware tests must be documented within the DVP&R file and coordinated with the Testing & Validation department. The plan should include:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirements.
- Detailed description of testing with devices used (including setup pictures).
- Specifications of where the testing was performed (internal/external).

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.
AAR is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 (including quantity of parts and timing). Suppliers are responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design per agreed timing to secure OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR approval. The process begins in the early phase at PT build stage to guarantee AAR Approval at LS. Suppliers must integrate AAR activity into their development process and ED&D costs.

Page 28
4.3 Homologation and safety regulation requirements

4.3.1 North America  
a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., European, Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) and Canadian motor vehicle safety standards (CMVSS).  
The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.  

b. Self-certification and test report(s).  
The supplier is responsible for âself-certifyingâ their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain of the FMVSS/CMVSS.  
The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
The Supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.   
(*) Refer Appendix 8 of Manufacturer_Handbook.  

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations.  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The Supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.  

4.3.2 Europe  
a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.  
The Supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.

6 Supplier responsibilities.

Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract. 

**Customer service requirements.**

**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall not be shorter than 10 years after VINFAST starts production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.  

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).
