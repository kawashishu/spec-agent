**Scope.**

VinFast (VinFast Trading and Production Limited Liability Company) have started to design and develop a new BEV C-SUV vehicle. Environmental impact and sustainability of the program are taken into account as essential target features. This SPB shall provide details for all components for mass production of the PREM Program. This SPB covers VF7 (VF34 old naming) vehicle line.

**Figure Description.**

The image shows the Body Control Module (BCM) unit, which is an integral component for managing various electrical functions within the VF7 vehicle. It features multiple visible ports and connectors designed for interfacing with other system components.

1 General Document Guidelines.

1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.
This version is legally binding. This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard. Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g. what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g. level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English. All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document:

**Shall**  
The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.  

**Should**  
The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.  

**May**  
The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

- **BCM_DCSG3:** The BCM Door control module shall periodically monitor the crash status from the other modules (ACM, etc.) through a CAN channel as a redundant crash status input to detect crash and shall transition to safe state [SS1] within FTTI duration. **ASIL A**

- **BCM_DCSG4:** Upon crash detection from signals received from the CAN inputs mentioned in [FSR003], the BCM Door control module shall unlock all the doors through the Central locking system within FTTI duration. **ASIL A**

- **BCM_DCSG5:** The BCM Door control module shall monitor for any faults in processing the crash inputs received from the ACM and unlock the door latches as expected due to the internal faults in BCM microcontroller and shall transit to safe state [SS1] within FTTI duration. **ASIL A**
