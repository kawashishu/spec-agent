### 4. Definitions and applicable documents.  

#### 4.1 CAD Data/Transfer data - CAD Requirements.  
All CAD data must be designed with CATIA V5 following VF standard VFDST00000014. CAD data transfer from VinFast to the supplier will be done through the Supplier Collaborative Module. For more details, refer to the Supplier Collaborative Module in the RFQ package.  

#### 4.2 Change Documentation and Part History Documentation.  
During the development and production process, all the history of changes within the contractor's framework must be documented and provided to VinFast and OEM/Supplier by the contractor (e.g., entries in a project manual). The form of the data can be defined by the contractor.  

Vehicle Documentation Systems or components that must fulfill safety regulations or legal requirements must be remarked upon on the drawings. The reasons and the listed characteristics are authorities' demands. These will be requested during the development and at the latest during the PTO phase.

### 5. Description and scope of work.  

#### 5.1 Technical Requirement.  
This specification establishes the technical cooling module requirements for the BEV Chiller. It must be ensured that VINFAST can audit adherence to all requirements in the technical specification.  

The system developer commits to developing all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data during the design process to achieve the purpose of the project.  

The technical and commercial release will be carried out by the customer according to the change management process.  

The assignment aims to validate a chiller for the BEV variants that support HVAC and battery thermal requirements. The chiller is one of the critical components for battery cooling on BEV vehicles.  

---

#### Table: BEV Chiller Component Details.  

1. **Part Name:** BATT_CHILLER.  
   **Part No.:** PWT30203002.  
   **Quantity:** 1 unit.  
   **Material:** Not specified.  
   **Purchase Level:** P.  
   **Applications:** BEV - VF32 (SMART and PLUS) and VF33 (SMART and PLUS) in VN + ASEAN and US markets.

5.1.1 System description.
A Chiller is a heat exchanger that helps in absorbing heat from the hot oil from the Battery to support the process of Battery cooling. It is a plate heat exchanger with provisions for both the fluids (refrigerant to oil) to move across it. The battery coolant exchanges heat with the refrigerant in the AC circuit. The use of Chiller could come in handy during conditions when the Radiator is not able to cool down the Battery on its own.

Required chiller will include:
- Laminated heat exchanger.
- Thermal expansion valve (TXV).
- Solenoid valve (if possible).  

The objective is to minimize the complexity and high commonality. Intention is to use off-the-shelf products to minimize development timing. The supplier should provide in advance a portfolio of off-the-shelf parts supporting VinFast requirements.

5.1.2 Package layout overview.
The complete vehicle is still under development. Use dimensions provided as reference to confirm technical feasibility and provide initial quotation. More accurate dimensions/envelops will be provided once they are available.

The system designer has to coordinate all components of the module in relation to:
- Packaging,  
- Function,  
- Fixing,  
- Tolerances.  

Below dimensions are defined based on the BEV layout. The objective is to have the most compact possible design while taking into account the overall low cost and acceptable quality. It is the responsibility of the supplier to confirm the most cost-effective alternative(s) for each variant.

5.1.4 System requirements.

System suppliers are required to define characteristic curves and values that match thermal and electrical requirements from HVAC and Battery systems. The BEV cooling system will utilize coolant for battery cooling, which needs to be cooled in the chiller. The selection criteria for the chiller will be based on the coolant type and its characteristics.

### Requirements:
- Geometry.
- Acoustics, vibrations, and resonances.
- Lifecycle based on the operational profile.
- Ease of service and repair.

### Characteristic curves:
Suppliers are mandated to provide characteristic charts for chiller samples. Additionally, pressure test certificates must be issued for each chiller to ensure compliance.

### Refrigerant properties:
The refrigerant for the AC system is either R134a or R1234yf. The properties are detailed as follows:

**For R134a:**
- Air temperature at the condenser inlet: 35 ± 0.3°C (max 20% RH).
- Refrigerant temperature at the condenser inlet: 83.5 ± 0.3°C.
- Refrigerant pressure at the condenser inlet: 1620 ± 10 kPa abs.
- Subcooling condenser outlet: 5 ± 0.5 K.
- Oil circulation: 5%.

**For R1234yf:**

### 5.1.4 System Requirements
The system supplier is required to define characteristic curves/values matching the thermal and electrical requirements from the HVAC and Battery systems. The BEV cooling system utilizes coolant for battery cooling, which is further cooled in the chiller. Selection of the chiller depends on coolant type and characteristics.

The key requirements are:
- **Geometry**
- **Acoustics, vibrations, resonances**
- **Life expectancy based on the operational profile**
- **Ease and feasibility of repair services**

**Characteristic Curves:**  
Suppliers must provide characteristic charts for the chiller samples. Pressure test certificates must accompany each chiller provided.

**Refrigerant Properties:**  
- Refrigerants used in the AC system are R134a or R1234yf.
- Key specifications for both refrigerants are as follows:

| **Refrigerant** | **R134a**                                                    | **R1234yf**                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Air temp condenser inlet | 35 ± 0.3°C (max 20% RH)                                 | 35 ± 0.3°C (max 20% RH)                                    |
| Refrigerant temp condenser inlet | 83.5 ± 0.3°C                                     | 78.5 ± 0.3°C                                              |
| Refrigerant pressure condenser inlet | 1620 ± 10 kPa abs                            | 1600 ± 10 kPa abs                                          |
| Sub cooling condenser outlet | 5 ± 0.5 K                                          | 5 ± 0.5 K                                                  |
| Oil circulation | 5%                                                             | 5%                                                         |

### 5.1.5 Interfaces
The components must be designed to ensure seamless functionality when integrated with adjoining systems and interfaces.

**Key Interface Points:**
- **AC Lines**
- **Electrical connections**
- **Chiller assembly mounting brackets**
- **BIW** (Body in White – clearances, packaging, resonances, stiffness)
- **Traction Battery**
- **Chassis clearances** to components such as cooling system, electric system, and piping.
- **Complete vehicle performance targets**.

**Environmental Conditions:**  
The system will operate within ambient temperature variations from -30°C to 40°C and corrosive environments. It must also endure all types of road loads, including impacts caused by off-road driving.

The critical interfaces for the system include chiller mounting and fixation strategies. These interfaces influence the positioning and clearances of the chiller while considering durability, static and dynamic behavior, and tolerances stack-up.
