- A.2: Product design life is 160,000 km in 10 years, limited to the condition that whichever occurs first.
- A.3: Secondary matching restrictions require the bidder to submit a second set of supporting manufacturers to VINFAST for identification.

(1) Requirements on automobile recycling and control of prohibited and restricted substances:
- A) The materials used for components must adhere to the national standards and VINFAST regulations.

3.2.1.2 Certification.
- Certification verifies product reliability through simulated conditions equivalent to 10 years or 160,000 km of customer service use. Successful completion requires a simulated durability test on parts or subsystems as prescribed by VINFAST.
- Supplied parts must meet VINFAST certification requirements and include corresponding test reports.
- VINFAST ensures vehicle-level system integration and certification through urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing programs.
Page 8
component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.

Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. The supplier must complete all component/subsystem tests.

The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.

In any event, the supplier is obligated to complete all specified test requirements.

The component/subsystem supplier must provide VINFAST's product release engineer with a complete component/subsystem test certification plan approved by the engineer. The plan shall include at least: number of samples, test sequence, place, and time of each test.

### 3.2.2 General Description of the System / Component

It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification have to be agreed upon between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve system-specific requirements and the fulfillment of all laws and ratings of system markets. No modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.

For technical proposals that exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and the time schedule.

The technical and commercial release will proceed by the customer according to change management.

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of system markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the Class B and C common platform. VINFAST shall also monitor ongoing changes in rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.

The supplier delivers the system as a module (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated).

### Add-on parts are:
For the documentation of the release, the following sheets and documents are necessary:
- Drawings
- Simulations
- Quality regulations
- Results/documentation of test validation
- Documentation of the FMEA

Then fulfill Table 1 below:

### 6 Supplier Responsibilities

Supplier responsibilities are explicitly defined for mitigating risks of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract. Key requirements are:

#### Customer Service Requirements
- **After-sales spare parts availability:** Suppliers must ensure spare parts are ready at startup to meet customer service needs.

#### Deliverables
Suppliers are responsible for providing detailed items and documentation throughout various project stages, ensuring compliance with timing gates, quality standards, and engineering requirements.

Suppliers must:
- Deliver 3D CAD and 2D drawings to VinFast Engineering for reviews and approvals.
- Conduct functional CAE analysis and manufacturing feasibility studies.
- Ensure timely submission of PFMEA and detailed System, Sub-System & Component Development Validation (DV) reports.
- Finalize tooling orders and engineering change management strategies.
- Achieve appearance approval, color harmony, and grain approval for all visible parts before key milestones such as LS (Launch Series).

#### Milestone Integration
Suppliers must adhere to structured stages in the RASI chart, including concept development, validation, and serial production phases. They will actively contribute to the design, testing, and quality optimization efforts within defined project gates.

#### Compliance and Certification
Suppliers are tasked with guaranteeing parts meet all homologation, regulatory standards, and certifications required for North America and Europe. Additional responsibilities include self-certifying parts against FMVSS/CMVSS or European UN-ECE regulations. Any non-compliance must be communicated to VinFast immediately, alongside proposed risk assessments and resolution plans.

#### Post-Project Support
Suppliers must continue active collaboration for ongoing engineering changes, ensuring complete system functionality and target achievement through the serial development phase.

**End of Supplier Responsibilities Section**
Page 28
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle**
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need ensure life cycles of project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts**
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).
