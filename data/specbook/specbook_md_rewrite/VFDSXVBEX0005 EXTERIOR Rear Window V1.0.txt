### Function

**Functional characteristics and technical requirements:**

- The light transmission values must comply with legal requirements and country-specific specifications. Component details are to be taken from the drawing.  
- The “Outer rear window” component must account for all tolerances of parts and assemblies (such as BIW, cover frame, adjoining parts).  
- Component functionality must consider all existing tolerances.  
- Tolerance analyses (e.g., function measurement concept) must be provided to responsible departments or personnel during development.  
- Ensure assembly compatibility with adjoining components (body, cowl cover, wiper system, etc.).  
- A covering (e.g., black print) must be provided for the gluing area.  
- Window thickness must be determined in collaboration with VinFast.  
- Eliminate noise caused by unfavorable tolerances between components or joints.  
- For safety-related matters, compliance with legal requirements must be demonstrated.  
- Ensure sufficient sound insulation from external noise, while audio warnings (e.g., sirens) remain audible.  
- Maintain optical integrity—color, contrast, and no distortions—from the external environment.  
- Achieve an absolutely clear view in non-silk-screened areas.  
- Shape should allow adequate cleanability with the rear wiper system, when included.  
- The "Outer rear window" must:
  - Be vibration-free across the vehicle’s speed range.  
  - Exhibit extreme resistance to mechanical loads (ice scraper, dust, dirt, etc.).  
  - Be resistant to chemical substances (e.g., cleaning agents, battery acid, fuels, oils, salt).  
- Adhesive agent or glue must remain invisible from outside the window.  
- Material, surface, shape, and components of the rear window must not compromise adjoining components, including tolerances and body-in-white interaction.  
- Components must be secure against unintended displacement or dismounting.  
- Assure proper functionality in all conditions, with consideration for part and assembly tolerances (BIW, cover frame, adjoining parts).  
- Do not impair the rear brake light system’s functionality if visible through the rear window surface.

Page 17
Generally, all main simulation and testing activities on vehicle level are outlined in DVP. Tests in supplier responsibility are outlined in respective component/system specifications. Engine start needs to be possible after 5 weeks of the vehicle’s non-operative state (idle time).

### Test Plan
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SUPPLIER has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of his component has the SUPPLIER. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on committed schedule. The SUPPLIER has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the SUPPLIER site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast/SUPPLIER.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or a different testing procedure, the testing has to be redone at the cost of the SUPPLIER. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned, and the retesting has to be paid by SUPPLIER if they are responsible for the failure.

### Required Data for DVP&R
The following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and timeline of the testing (in the form of a project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

### Responsibility of the SUPPLIER
The SUPPLIER is responsible to use the draft DVP&R provided by VF testing department. The initial data filling has to be done by the SUPPLIER and has to be submitted to VF (at least 4 weeks after the nomination of the SUPPLIER).

The SUPPLIER has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.

The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SUPPLIER. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department (VF), SQA (VinFast), and the SUPPLIER before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be finalized.
