3.7.1.1 Triggering Time and Airbag Inflation Time.

The triggering time or ‘time to fire’ (TTF) is a deployment time, which is determined by the Airbag Control Unit (please also refer to VFDSXVEEP0021). Pending the type and severity of the impact, the ACU will send out triggering voltage to the airbag(s).  

The inflation time is the time when an airbag is triggered by the ACU and reaches its restraint position, expected to be fully inflated.  

The minimum required inflation time for the VF9 airbag modules is as follows:

Page 11
### 3.7.1.4 System and Vehicle Testing Activities

Beside Component Level Testing Activities of restraint system modules listed in Section 6, it is important that System and Vehicle levels of testing activities are conducted to support development. These activities are categorized into three groups:

1. **Virtual Testing Activities or Computer Aided Engineering (CAE)**  
2. **Sled Testing Activities**  
3. **Full Vehicle Crash Testing Activities**

The findings from these testing activities help confirm airbag requirements on module and system levels, effectiveness of protection coverage, and Time to Fire for specific load cases dictated by high-speed impacts (Front and Side). Once confirmed, the airbags are installed into the vehicle and validated through Physical Full Vehicle Crash Testing Activities. After validation, this document will be updated accordingly.

#### Picture Examples:
**Driver Airbag Coverage**  
- **US Cushion Volume**: 55L (TBD)  
- **VN Cushion Volume**: 45L (TBD)  

*Images illustrating airbag coverage for US and VN drivers are provided.*

**Passenger Airbag Coverage (1st Row)**  
Pictures showing Airbag Coverage for 1st Row Passenger (US and VN) to be included.
Page 12
3.7.1.4 System and Vehicle Testing Activities

Beside Component Level Testing Activities for restraint system modules listed in Section 6, system and vehicle levels of testing activities must be conducted to support the development as listed in Sections 5.6.1 to 5.6.4. Testing activities can be categorized as follows:
- Virtual Testing Activities or Computer Aided Engineering (CAE)
- Sled Testing Activities
- Full Vehicle Crash Testing Activities

The findings of these activities confirm the airbag requirements at module and system levels, assess the effectiveness of protection coverage, and determine Time to Fire for specific load cases typically dictated by high-speed impacts (front and side). Once confirmed, systems should be validated with Physical Full Vehicle Crash Testing Activities. Updates to this document will follow confirmed testing results.

**Airbag Coverage for Driver (US and VN)**
Pictures showing airbag coverage for driver (US and VN) are included. 

- US Cushion Volume: 55L (TBD)

3.7.2 VF9 Restrains.

3.7.2.1 Individual components.
- Individual components are to be designed in a modular structure. The adaptation of additional functions shall not require significant interference in the base component.
- When joining individual components, the vehicle’s marginal conditions in terms of installation space, screw joints, twist and mismatching protection, and support surfaces must be observed.

3.7.2.2 Belt automat.
- Activated locking systems (vehicle- and belt strap-sensitive system) in installed or dismantled conditions must automatically unlock when installed. The locking system must not catch during drive operation.
- A non-magnetic vehicle-sensitive locking system is to be offered.
- The retraction spring (pull-out and retraction forces) is to be designed to achieve better comfort values (vehicle adaptation required). At parking length, the retraction force is between 2.0 N and 2.3 N under consideration of the spring tolerances. As per test, the retraction force is a minimum of 80% of the force in new condition.
- Vehicle- and belt strap-sensitive locking systems are in park position to park position + 100 mm in the turned-off condition (to be offered as an option).
- In the US Market, child seat protections (KiSi) are mandatory on all seats (driver seat excepted).
- A significant audible function sound on present and turned-on KiSi (child seat protection) is to be guaranteed.
- The position of the KiSi-turn-on point is within 10 mm to 60 mm before full unrolling of the belt strap. The tolerance range of the KiSi-turn-off point is 50 mm.
- Exchange of left/right and front/rear is not permissible.
- Controlled and orderly retraction of the belt strap (straps are exactly aligned) is required.
- Contact with automat components resulting in damage to the belt strap or increased friction is not permissible. This function is to be guaranteed during transverse extension of the seat belt.
- A standard or reverse automat may be used as required.
- Installation of sound-isolating elements on the vehicle must be possible. With several automat variants for a vehicle (e.g., ECE/US), it must be observed not to impact the geometry of the sound-isolating element in the vehicle.
- The automatic belts are available as mirror variants if required (to be offered as an option). Directly unwinding automatic belts are to be coated black.
- When retracting the belt strap, folding and twisting must be avoided (e.g., through geometry of the belt arrangement).
- On delivery, the retracted belt strap must be inside the housing geometry of the automat. Belt straps not retracted during delivery must be protected from damage and dirt during transport.
Page 15
3.7.2.2 Belt automat  
- Measures at the automat must counteract potential irregularities in the shell structure at the support surface of the automat.  
- Covers to protect the belt strap from contact with adjoining components must be available. See also [VFDST00027801].  

3.7.2.3 Pretensioner

The responsibility of function and operation of the overall airbag safety system is required, to meet all regulatory requirements as specified in the specifications list below, and to integrate with interfacing system modules (e.g., safety belts, seats, etc.), as well as achieving the passive safety performance for the following:  
1) ASEAN NCAP 5-star  
2) US NCAP 5-Star Rating  
3) IIHS ‘Good’ Rating  
4) EURO NCAP 5 Star*  
   
* - SRS Package Protect if it is not stated as a program requirement. Otherwise, line items for development efforts and testing activities shall be included in the Quotation Proposal.  

6 Supplier Responsibilities  
Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.  

**Customer Service Requirements**  
- After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup:  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

- Spare Parts Support Cycle:  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need to ensure life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST ends the production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.  

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes:  
- BOM table  
- Parts structure and function description  
- Fault diagnosis  
- Special tools for maintenance  
- Relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearance, parts performance parameters).
