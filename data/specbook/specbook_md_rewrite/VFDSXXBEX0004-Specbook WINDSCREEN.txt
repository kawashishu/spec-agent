### 3.5 Traceability
For part requirements, follow the specification detailed in VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

### 3.6 Labeling of Parts
Suppliers must adhere to VinFast standard VFDST00000010, ensuring label positions are documented with corresponding figures and setup pictures.

### 3.7 Testing and Validation and DVP&R
DVP and PC test responsibilities follow RASIC. Testing includes both virtual and physical analysis for systems, subsystems, and components, in line with the Complete Vehicle Specification during the concept phase. Detailed hardware test planning is captured in the DVP&R file and requires collaboration with the Testing & Validation department, as per the following guidelines:
- Declaration of standards, norms, and legal requirements.
- Testing setup description and associated pictures.
- Specification of testing location (internal/external).
- Duration and timeline for testing (project plan format).
- Part variant and description.
- Count and details of components/parts tested.

#### Mileage Target Life Requirement:
Ensure a test life span of 160,000 km or 10 years, whichever occurs first.

#### Testing Standards and Documentation:
Testing requirements will be communicated separately. Suppliers must confirm receipt of all VinFast testing standards in addition to those referenced within this SOR. Relevant testing protocols include:
- **VFDSXVBEX0104**
- **VFDSXVBEX0104_DVP_WINDSCREEN.xlsx**

### 3.7.1 Test Plan
The test plan must clearly outline testing schedules, parties responsible, and devices required. It should visually document test results and track testing progress. Results must be controlled consistently throughout the process. If verification is requested by VinFast, the supplier must provide necessary parts free of charge.

#### Procedure and Validation:
Testing procedures and documentation must be approved by VinFast's validation engineer or component lead engineer. Weekly updates or revisions in response to development changes are mandatory.

#### Safeguarding Responsibilities:
The supplier is responsible for ensuring comprehensive testing and validation of components. Testing schedules must account for approvals and retesting following negative results. Suppliers must provide all testing protocols/reports for VinFast's verification and accommodate VinFast's presence during testing conducted on-site or at the supplier's test centers.

#### Deviations:
Any deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon by VinFast and the supplier.
Page 18
If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts or different testing procedures, the testing must be redone at the cost of the FSS supplier. In case of negative test results, the tests must be re-planned, and the retesting must be paid for by the FSS supplier if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data must be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of a project plan).
- Part variant and description of the part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The FSS supplier is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by the VinFast testing department. The initial data filling must be done by the FSS supplier and submitted to VinFast at least four weeks after the nomination of the FSS supplier.

The FSS supplier must plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer at VinFast.

The test plan must be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the FSS supplier. The DVP&R must be agreed upon between the test department (VinFast), SQA (VinFast), and the FSS supplier before concept confirmation. After this approval, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly.

In case of any scheduling delay, the FSS supplier must deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule. Upon request, the FSS supplier must draw up a test plan for each single component.

### Test Plan Example:
The DVP must be updated weekly on the following points by the supplier:
Page 19

It must be guaranteed, that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.  

In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.  

The supplier has to download the VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC.  
Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the FSS SUP must be included in the quotation of the FSS SUP and ordered from VinFast by the FSS SUP.

3.7.2 Testing

3.7.2.1 General  
The FSS SUP prepares a detailed, backdated testing plan on time while considering the vehicle timing chart. It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested. To prevent double testing, mechanical and electrical tests should be combined as far as possible.

The Supplier is required to download the VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC. Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the FSS SUP must be stated in the quotation and ordered from VinFast by the FSS SUP.

Unless otherwise agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. Parts required for testing activities at the VinFast test department must be provided by the FSS SUP free of charge. The component developer must ensure compliance with relevant legislations and VinFast requirements in the performance specification.  

All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and submitted to VF. Compliance with all relevant target markets law obligations must be achieved. Testing documentation must meet VinFast standards or FSS SUP standards if accepted by VF. The FSS SUP evaluates and performs tests for all development phases as per the specification.  

Tests must be formatted in the required DVP&R template (as an enclosure to the offer).

Samples for sample inspections must be made available on time or no later than the coordinated agreed date with the test department. Manual samples may suffice in certain cases, providing information for assembling issues to ensure the installability of test parts. 

VinFast Logistics determines the sample parts number, while VinFast Purchase orders the parts. A measurement report for sample parts must be delivered alongside. Development parts or partial body structures needed for testing at the FSS SUP must be stated in quotations and ordered from VinFast by the FSS SUP. CAD models compliant with VinFast requirements must be timely provided for virtual sample manufacturing. 

Corresponding samples must be presented to VF approval offices with a Cubing Report and Appearance Approval Report based on VF Standard Color Matching/Appearance Approval VFDST00038400. Timing for matching parts is provided by the matching department, and parts are supplied free of charge by the FSS SUP.

Marking, preparation of measurement reports, evaluation system, and reference point systems must follow corresponding VF Standards:

If issues arise (negative results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the FSS SUP must submit a test report, be available upon request, and propose solutions to maintain milestones and targets. An “OK” or “NOK” result must be stated clearly on the first sheet of the report.

3.7.2.3 Analyses and Test Reports  
The FSS SUP provides measurement reports (VFDST00008900) electronically with aligned measurement concepts for all parts during prototype phases. Following tests, test samples are analyzed in detail, with measurements and results documented individually in a comprehensive test report.  

Test reports are submitted to the responsible VF department for release. Upon request, results, along with documentation from all tests (prototype inspections and inspections conducted during development), must be submitted to the relevant specialist department.

Tests carried out parallel to series production must be planned and documented in regular intervals or as required.
