**5 Description and Scope of Work**

**5.1 Technical requirement**

**5.1.1 Project Requirements**

**5.1.1.1 Quality Requirements**
Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements.” 
The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging and logistic specifications etc.).

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.

The components are to be laid out such that the functions in connection with and to the adjacent systems are ensured:
- The system/the component should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.
- Should be designed for high-volume production.
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime (unless activated).
- Be fully functional as part of the active hood system when sensors are triggered.
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.

**5.1.1.2 Certification**
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VinFast. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VinFast and issue the corresponding test report.
- VinFast is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing, and component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. Suppliers must complete all component/subsystem tests.
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VinFast approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.

5.1.5.17 Geometrical Integration.

**RPS (Reference Position System).** The classification of the testing range occurs in a functional area. The objective of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. A RPS-concept for the design has to be created with the quality assurance in the SE process. The RPS determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts must be achieved within the RPS system VFDST00000011 [34] according to the interior and BIW department.

**Tolerance analyses.** The following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-components and complete systems, including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermic change tests across all climate conditions.
- Thermal expansion must be considered.

5.2 General CAE Requirements.

Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL.

5.3 Material requirement.

**Generally.** For determining corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system.

1. **Corrosivity Low.** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road deicing salts.
Page 18
### 5.3.1 Corrosivity Classification

1. **Corrosivity Low**:  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium**:  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High Corrosivity**:  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very High Corrosivity**:  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.  

### Material Considerations

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. For critical material combinations, proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  

- Avoid water and dirt accumulation; always provide drainage in the lowest positions.  
- Avoid dirt traps where sand can act as an abrasive and damage painted surfaces through micro movements.  
- Ensure dry contact surfaces that are large enough for low pressure and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.  
- Provide burr-free edges and ensure good edge coverage in paint systems.  

### Corrosion Tests

The parts have to pass both system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

#### Tests for Metallic Surface Components  
- **Salt Spray Test (ISO 9227)**: Acceptance criteria specified below.  

#### Tests for Organic Coatings  
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT, ISO 11997 Cycle B)**: Acceptance criteria specified below.  

*Alternative tests may be proposed and must be approved by a corrosion engineer.*  

### Corrosion Test Criteria

### 7 Function Safety, Homologation and Safety Regulations
Safety is one of the key issues in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety is concerned with E/E systems.
Page 21
7.1 Functional Safety Requirements
The supplier shall ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet the IATF 16949:2016 standard, Quality management system requirements for automotive production. The supplier shall also ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet the ISO 26262:2018 standard, Road vehicles – Functional safety.

Follow standard ISO 26262-8:2011 requirement point 5.4.2.2.

**The RFQ from the customer to the supplier candidates shall include:**  
a) A formal request to comply with ISO 26262:  
    - The supplier must ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet ISO 26262:2011 standard (for Car programs), or ISO 26262:2018 standard (for Scooter and Bus programs).  
    - The supplier must ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet IATF 16949:2016 standard.  

b) The specification of the scope of supply.

**Cooperation with the VinFast vehicle safety department**  
The supplier is responsible for supporting the integration of vehicle safety functions actively. Lifetime relevant laws and ratings of selling markets as well as OEM requirements must be taken into account.

---

**General demands**  
Unless further specific definitions are provided, the following points must be considered by the supplier:  
- Vehicle safety functions must be maximally prepared on the system level with expertise, CAE, and testing.  
- Project relevant supplier data must be handed over to VinFast on request and free of charge. VinFast is allowed to forward this to other parties within the project.  
- Target fulfillment of performances with spread effects must be secured through an adequate number of worst results from identical test series.  
- Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand to support and reach vehicle data freeze milestones. These must be realized within LsDyna and validated to ensure numerical and physical stability.  
- FE meshes must be homogeneous, align with part axes/geometry, and have a density of 8-10mm. In case meshing guidelines are not followed, FE meshes must be reworked.  
- For generating validated CAE material cards, activities must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier, including principle tests on systems and components.  
- The supplier’s test matrix must align with full vehicle timing demands. Before higher-scaled tests (e.g., sled or vehicle crash tests) are planned, supplier optimization test series must be completed.  
- Supplier-specific parts, whether physical components or CAE models needed for testing activities within any part of the project, must be provided by the supplier free of charge to relevant testing facilities. If costs arise for physical parts and CAE models, they must be accounted for by the supplier.
Page 22
 Integration of requests pointed out from the full vehicle crash optimizations process at VinFast must be accepted without add-on costs; e.g., material definitions, material thicknesses, additional parts, optimizations work.

### General Requirements
- For each single target value, a mandatory 20% safety margin has to be applied.
- Occupant survival area integrity vs. part behavior and fluids, including parts that are directly and not directly in contact with any passengers.
- No edges below 3.2mm during and after impact.
- Electrical system integrity during impact and for post-crash functions.
- Consideration of relevant tolerances.
- Robust target achievement.
- Asymmetries must be investigated on each side until a reliable worst case is confirmed by VinFast.
- No modifiers for any rating.

### Additional Specific Demands
- Without claim to be complete.
- Any tracking actions of concerned parties for observed issues must be done (e.g., to get parts, data, CAE models, information from further suppliers).
- Any devices, such as test bucks/sleds/etc., must be set up by the supplier, based on unfinished parts (e.g., a non-prepared BIW to be used finally as a sled).

- For targets totally or partly fulfilled on a system level, the supplier has to prepare homologation and/or certificate documents. Data has to be handed over to VinFast free of charge.
- In case of carry-over parts/systems, fulfillment of system requirements can be shown by donor vehicle performance data.

### Additional Requirements
The actuators are one part of the APSS (active pedestrian safety system) and ensure that the hood is in an upright position in time to protect pedestrians in case of impact. The main parameters for the actuators are piston stroke, piston force, and retaining force (compare chapter 2.3.3). The force during activation should not be too high due to oscillation of the hood and hinges based on high energy input but should not be too low after activation (retaining force) so that different dummies cannot move down the hood with their body mass before the head impacts the hood.

All the components have to work properly within the specified temperature and humidity range:
- Temperature: -30°C to +85°C.
- Relative humidity: 10% - 95%.

The supplier has to verify with a sufficient number of hardware tests that both the activation time and the required forces (see 2.3.3) are reached at the lower boundary, room temperature, and upper boundary of the above-mentioned temperature and humidity range. All these hardware tests must be done according to the state of the art for this kind of testing (climatic chamber in combination with a fall tower, high-speed videos, and measurement force vs. time and activation height vs. time).

The fixation brackets of the actuators must withstand all activation forces during the above-mentioned environmental and thermic conditions without significant elastic and plastic deformations.
Page 23
Functional Responsibility

The supplier must ensure that the function of "popping up the hood" remains available, even in the event of fixation bracket deformation. For example, the piston must not slip off the hinge counterpart due to bracket deformation during the complete activation and holding process.

The supplier shall provide components for testing purposes and, if needed, facilitate activator tuning while ensuring the participation of specialists during local testing and troubleshooting processes.

Safety Goals and Functional Safety Requirements:

The supplier shall address the safety goals or the relevant safety requirements, including their assigned ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level). Where the ASIL is not yet determined, a conservative assumption is permissible.

**Safety Goal Requirements**
- ONLY under circumstances where specifying restrictions is necessary.
- FTTI: Attribute of the safety goal as well as a safe state.
- ASIL: Attribute of the safety goal.

**System Requirement**
- Requirements should reference physical entities such as speed, acceleration, yaw, etc., as controlled or perceived by the user of the system. If necessary, system-specific subsystems interacting with broader subsystems can be referenced.
- FTTI: Frequently inherited from the safety goal and potentially already decomposed using applicable ASIL decomposers.
- ASIL decomposition is generally done where subsystems interact to mitigate risks, such as distributed safety architectures.

Examples:
- A distributed safety architecture within the VCU detects hazardous acceleration excursions and shuts down the electric machine torque.
