Page 10
 Storage function.  
 Optical/styling function.  
 Absorption of noises.  
 Absorbing properties in case of head-impact.  
 Integration of add-on parts.  

The center console must fulfill all functions over its lifetime.

 The components of the center console must be designed in consideration of all tolerances of parts and assemblies.  
 The function of the component must be proven in consideration of all existing tolerances.  
 Tolerance analyses must be submitted to the departments or persons responsible for the development.  
 Assemble ability with adjoining components (body, cockpit, seats, carpet, etc.).  
 Safety of function under all loads stated in drawings, test specifications, quality specifications, and texts of laws.  
 Avoiding of noise caused by the function of components or by joints due to unfavorable tolerances.  
 With regard to safety-relevant matters, proof must be given that the respective legal requirements have been met.  
 Regarding the RFQ, the climatic requirements will depend on common VinFast OEM standards.  
 All components have to be functional in the whole temperature range (-30°, +85°).  
 For fastening, clips and screws will be used.  
 Sliding lid cup holder (lid is designed as a sliding lid). In the open position, the sliding cover must lock, closing automatically by push-push function. It is important to ensure that no kinematic components are visible in closed and opening positions.  
 The system of trim parts must not prevent functionality of other systems.  
 After a crash, no parts must become loose and no sharp-edged breakups are allowed.  
 Screwed fastening must be designed in a way that neither terminal forces nor lifetime causes a shrinkage behavior which releases the screwed fastening.  
 During stiffness and rigidity testing, there must not be any permanent deformations, breakage, or customer-relevant modifications.  
 During the design process of the component, all components on the feature list must be taken into account.  

### Materials

 Material-compliant fits, curvatures, and corners allowing visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces.  
 Uniform, proportionally accurate, and material-compliant run-out of component edges, corners, and ribs.  
 Selection of concepts and production methods that facilitate homogeneous structures and grain structures.
Page 11
Avoidance of visible screw points and screw point covers as well as dummy covers. Surfaces free of burrs in the visual and haptic zone. No view of other parts (it should not be possible to recognize other components through grilles, trim covers, indentations, joints, and cavities; neat and tidy overall impression). Ensuring correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts with regard to disturbance noise. Free of disturbing noise and odor in contact with the environment. Surfaces have to be designed due to ISO 1302 [14].

In order to coordinate the form and the surface, corresponding samples incl. Cubing report and Appearance Approval report (see VF Standard Color matching / Appearance Approval VFDST00038400 [12] and VDA 280 part 1 [39]) have to be presented by the supplier to the corresponding approval offices of MSE.

Variants:
Described in VinFast Feature-List excerpt (see chapter 2.2).

Interfaces:
The components must be designed such that the function is guaranteed in combination with the adjoining systems considering tolerance and thermal influence. The design of the parts has to cover the BIW tolerances according to the drawing specifications. The components must be designed such that the function and gap definitions are guaranteed in combination with the adjoining systems.

The interfaces must be worked out in cooperation with VinFast and in consideration of a quality method (e.g., FMEA, risk filter). Inhomogeneous thermal elongation of adjacent parts must be accounted for in order to provide the required gap- and step configuration. In the event of various (particularly metallic) materials used, measures are to be taken to prevent contact corrosion. Development of a system that is easily mountable without the risk of injury and which facilitates removal and re-mounting without damage. Neighboring components shall also not be damaged when removal is carried out properly. Care must be taken that the fit of the parts is adequately snug — even in the event of unfavorable tolerances of the components or of the surroundings. It must be ensured that components cannot be unintentionally displaced or removed.

Interfaces:
- BIW
- HVAC
- Electrical components
- Instrument panel
- Seats

**NVH and Driving Comfort**  
General: Complete Vehicle NVH and driving comfort targets.  
The vehicle shall enable an acoustics and vibration comfort which is well balanced with vehicle dynamics and drivability so that long distance driving comfort as well as driving over rough road is neither exhausting nor annoying. This requires the absolute absence of squeak & rattle issues under all load cases (speed, maneuver, temperature, …).  

**Supplier Responsibility**  
- The validation of NVH and driving comfort will be done on complete vehicle level and comprises real customer operation conditions. Before the validation on complete vehicle level takes place the supplier has to assure readiness of the components respectively the system for durability - and general testing. The evidence for the test maturity of the components has to be reported in the DVP&R (Design, Verification and Development Report) at component level.  
- System suppliers are requested to perform validation activities as specified in respective technical specifications. All parts that are required for the validation activities are specified by DVP&R and shall meet the required maturity level. VINFAST will define quality criteria and validation methods for alignment with suppliers.  
- In general, it is mandatory for the supplier to support the NVH development process and the complete product cycle as well. The support comprises intensive and active cooperation with the development team and manufacturing regarding root cause investigations. The supplier has to consider and support the achievement of complete vehicle NVH targets (objective and subjective targets) at component and system level.  
- All components have to be free of squeak - and rattle noises to avoid psychoacoustic annoyance during all operation conditions of the vehicle including audio acoustic excitation. The robustness of design has to be assured and reported virtually and in the hardware phase before serial release.  
- The sound of actuation noises must not be audible respectively representing a high quality impression integrated into the complete vehicle. The requirements are to be performed in all specified environmental and thermic conditions.  
- During serial manufacturing a capable quality assurance process has to be established to ensure the quality level.  
- The supplier has to provide components for testing and NVH tuning and ensures the participation of specialists during local testing and troubleshooting processes.

Vehicle Safety.

Cooperation with VinFast vehicle safety department:
The supplier is responsible to support the integration of vehicle safety functions actively. Lifetime relevant laws and ratings of selling markets, as well as OEM requirements, must be taken into account.

Specific demands:
- According to protocols: Pendulum impact UN-R21.
- Relevant in case of getting impact points from Art. 8 homologation procedure.

General demands:
- Unless further specific definitions will be given, the following points must be considered by the supplier.
- Vehicle safety functions must be maximally prepared at a system level through expertise, CAE, and testing.
- Project-relevant supplier data must be handed over to VinFast upon request and free of charge. VinFast is allowed to forward this to other parties within the project.
- Target fulfillment of performances with spread effects must be secured by an adequate number of worst results from identical test series.
- Part/system CAE models must be provided upon demand, e.g., to support vehicle data freeze milestones. These must be realized within LsDyna, validated, numerical, and physically stable.
- FE meshes must be homogeneous, according to part axles/geometry, with a density of 8-10mm. If meshing guidelines are not adhered to, FE meshes must be re-worked.
- For generating validated CAE material cards, activities must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier. This includes principle tests on systems and components.
- The supplier's test matrix must be defined according to full vehicle timing demands; before higher scaled tests are planned (such as sled or vehicle crash tests), optimization test series must be completed.
- Supplier-specific parts needed for testing activities must be provided free of charge to relevant facilities. In cases where costs arise for physical parts and CAE models required by the supplier, they must be borne by the supplier.
- Integration of requests from the full vehicle crash optimization process at VinFast must be accepted without additional costs, including material definitions, material thicknesses, parts, and optimization work.

General requirements:
- For each single target value, a mandatory 20% safety margin has to be applied.
- Occupant survival area integrity vs. part behavior and fluids, including parts that directly and indirectly contact passengers.
- No edges less than 3.2mm during and after impact.
- Electrical system integrity during impact and post-crash functions.
- Consideration of relevant tolerances.
Page 15
Robust target achievement must be ensured. Asymmetries must be investigated on each side until a reliable worst case is confirmed by VinFast. No modifiers are allowed for any Rating.

Additionally, to general demands, specific demands are provided:
- Without claim to be complete.
- Any tracking actions by concerned parties for observed issues must be performed, e.g., to acquire parts/data/CAE models/information from further suppliers.
- Any devices such as test bucks/sleds/etc. must be set up by the supplier using unfinished parts, e.g., a non-prepared BIW to be finally used as a sled.

For targets fully or partially fulfilled on system level, the supplier is required to prepare homologation and/or certification documents. These documents must be handed over to VinFast free of charge. For carry-over parts/systems, fulfillment of system requirements can be demonstrated using donor vehicle performance data.

### Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability)
Mounting torque must be lower than dismounting torque, as defined in the BOM.

#### Requirements:
During stiffness and rigidity testing, there must not be permanent deformations, breakages, or customer-relevant modifications.

#### Most Important Functions:
- Optical trim.
- Noise absorption.
- Energy absorption in case of head-impact.
- Integration of add-on parts.
- Support of curtain airbag performance.
- Fulfillment of all functions over lifetime.

#### Detailed Rigidity Requirements (see chapter 4.18.5):
- Lateral rigidity of the console.
- Rigidity of the console walls.
- Rigidity of the console armrest.
- Rigidity of sliding lid cup holder.
- Rigidity of gear shifter.

### Weight Management
Due to the significant influence of vehicle weight on energy consumption, minimizing total vehicle weight is the primary goal for weight management.
Page 16
Throughout the whole development attention must be paid on a weight-optimized design of all components. All weight reduction potentials have to be shown by the supplier, also with their impact on cost, timing, and quality.  

The whole system must not exceed a weight target of:  
**C CUV: 13.50 kg**

### Fuel Economy & Driving Performance  
Not applicable  

### Vehicle Dynamics & Fuel System Integration  
Not applicable  

### Vehicle Architecture & Ergonomics  
The complete vehicle must pass the requirements from the vehicle layout plans. All changes on parts and modules, which are affecting the vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence of the vehicle, have to be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.  

The definition and technical geometric specifications regarding complete vehicle dimensions in interior and exterior are based on **GCIE 2016 measurement definitions**.  

### Styling Technique Convergence  
All changes on parts and modules, which are affecting the exterior and/or interior styling surfaces of the vehicle, have to be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.  

Part- or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops have to be provided by the supplier (e.g., tooling demands, assembly sequence), based on defined requirements from VINFAST module leads. Technical input can be provided (e.g., as office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections).  

### Ergonomics  
The complete vehicle must pass the ergonomic test based on VINFAST internal procedures. All dimensional and material changes that affect ergonomics on parts and modules have to be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.  

All main ergonomic targets (e.g., ingress/egress, seating layout, armrest positions, steering wheel position, roominess definition) are derived by benchmark analysis.  

The final sign-off of all ergonomic targets will be done in close cooperation with VinFast, which is responsible for interior and exterior styling. VinFast ultimately approves targets by evaluations using the styling bucks.  

### Aerodynamics  
Not affected
Page 17
### In-Vehicle Thermal & Thermal Comfort  
**Outlet Positioning and range of adjustment:**  
Good body range has to be achieved with movement of lamellas in both directions. Switches for seat heating in the 2nd row for the Russian market must be integrated into the rear cover of the Center Console.  

### Air Ducts / Air Vents  
The cross-section of air ducts must be free of abrupt changes, which can increase friction losses and parasitic noise; sharp edges are critical for acoustics and flow resistance. Changes transverse to the direction of flow, such as deflections, must be designed with the maximum possible radius. Transitions between duct sections and vents must be smooth and tight on the airside.  
Development is according to VINFAST Standard VFDST00048400 [40].  

#### SUV - CC Air Vents Directivity Targets  
This section illustrates the directivity targets for the SUV air vents, emphasizing the directional range to ensure airflow targets are achieved. Specifications include:  
- **Up Directivity**: +48.77° above CAR x ref line (targeting a 100mm head offset).  
- **Lower Directivity**: -3.27° below CAR x ref line (targeting H-Point with 62.8mm driver hip joint).  
- **Neutral Directivity**: +22.75° above CAR x ref line (targeting chest area).  

### SUV - CC Air Vents Net Area  
This section visualizes the net area airflow distribution of the SUV air vents. It highlights zones targeting different parts of the passenger anatomy for optimized thermal comfort. Observations reference head, chest, and outer areas of occupant zones for airflow target achievement.

This leads to a Human Machine Interface concept that aims to provide a very clear usability to access mechatronic / mechanical functions.  

Position and design of switches as well as functional details are described in the so-called *“HMI-Book VN24 HMI Strategy V1.3 or higher/newer version”*.  

The HMI-Book is binding for all described parts and areas of the vehicle.  

**Additional Requirements:**  
- Fully functioning capability in the event of different temperature and climatic test loads (cold winter and hot summer complete vehicle testing).  
- No changes of gaps/steps and respectively no changes to haptic and malfunction tolerable over lifetime.  
- The complete vehicle must pass the functional validation test based on VINFAST internal procedure. All dimensional and functional changes affecting parts and modules must be communicated immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.  

**Observations:**  
- Net effective area at outlet is 32 cm² per air vent.  

**Remarks:**  
- At shutoff (V-vanes), net effective area will be lesser than at outlet.

Material Requirements & Corrosion.

### Corrosion Requirements Interior:
- Screws, bolts on Handles, mirror.  
- Key.  
- Seat belts.  
- Trunk area.  
- Seat structure.  
- Invisible structural parts.  
- Vehicle tooling.  

### Generally:  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
 
1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

3. **High corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very high corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

### Corrosion tests:  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

### Component test for Metallic Surfaces:  
- **Fog test:**  
   ISO6270 CH. Acceptance criteria see below.
Page 29
VinFast Management System  
VFDSXVBIN0035  
Version: 1  
Uncontrolled copy when printed  
29 | 51  
Print date  

**Salt spray test requirements:**  
- Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.  

**For Organic coatings:**  
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.  

**Alternative tests possible:**  
Tests proposed by supplier must be accepted by the corrosion engineer.  

**Test criteria:**

| Area                     | Corrosivity        | Metallic coatings          | Organic coatings          | Pass criteria                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                | 240 h NSS  ISO 9227      | 96 h  ISO6270 CH          | No red rust                        |
| Exterior                 | Medium            | 480 h NSS  ISO 9227       | 5 cycl. CCT  ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust; CCT: See below |
| High & not visible for customer / High & visible | 480/720 h NSS  ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT  ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust; CCT: See below |

**Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:**  
- **Rust creep:**  
  - Galvanized steel: ≤ 4 mm.  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: ≤ 1-2 mm.  

- **Blistering:**  
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  

- **Edge corrosion:**  
  - ≤ 10%.  

- **Weld seam corrosion:**  
  - ≤ 5%.  

- **Degree of rusting:**  
  - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).  

**Interior corrosion considerations:**  
The interior is considered a dry area, with low corrosivity. Exceptions may include floor areas or locations with wetness/abrasion by shoes or spilled liquids such as drinking juices, which could produce corrosion.  

**Recommendations:**  
- Prevent galvanic corrosion when combining different metals by applying coatings.  
- Ensure painted edges are burr-free for proper edge coverage and to avoid wear.  
- Seat structure (uncoated blank steel): Ensure areas prone to corrosion are invisible to customers, considering extreme positions of seat rests.  

**Invisible areas:**  
The test criteria may be lower for invisible regions, provided no corrosive products appear in visible areas and the full lifetime functionality is assured.  

**Vehicle tooling:**  
Typically stored in the trunk, usually with low corrosivity exposure. Tool surfaces with wear may exhibit medium corrosivity.
Page 30
See also: Corrosion requirements on Electric components.

**Test plan**  
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding test engineer of VINFAST.

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the component lies with the SDS. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The SDS has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast and SDS.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the cost of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting has to be paid by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

**Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:**  
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.  
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).  
- Responsible test department.  
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).  
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in the form of a project plan).  
- Part variant and description of part.  
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by VINFAST testing department. The initial data filling has to be done by the SDS and submitted to VinFast (at least 4 weeks after the nomination of the SDS).

The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SDS.

The DVP&R has to be agreed upon between the test department, SQA (VinFast), and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.
Page 31
The information, such as beginning and end of testing, for the test plan required from the SDS is marked as "red" in the attached example test plan.

### Test Plan Example
(Example test plan is visually displayed with necessary sections marked in "red." No textual detail is provided about its layout beyond the visual reference.)

### Testing  
#### General  
1. The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan considering the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.17).  
2. It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.  
3. To prevent double testing, mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.  
4. Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS must be stated in the quotation by the SDS and ordered from VinFast accordingly.  
5. Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be included in the delivery.  
6. Parts required for testing activities at the VinFast test department must be provided by the SDS free of charge.  
7. The SDS must ensure compliance with all relevant legislations and adhere to internal VFDST requirements detailed in the performance specifications.  
8. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and submitted to VinFast.  
9. Compliance with all relevant Vietnamese law obligations must be achieved.

#### Documentation Standards  
1. All tests must be documented according to VF standards, or alternatively SDS standards, if accepted by VinFast.  
2. The tests must be evaluated and performed by the SDS for the serial development phase based on the specification.  
3. The testing plan must be presented in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.  
4. Samples for inspections must be provided promptly, no later than the agreed date (coordinated with the test department).  

#### Preemptive Samples  
1. Even manual samples can provide sufficient information in certain cases.  
2. Measures can be introduced early in the case of assembly problems to ensure the installation ability of testing parts.
Page 32
VinFast Logistics determines the number of sample parts, while VinFast Purchase orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS.

CAD data models in compliance with VinFast requirements must be provided in time for virtual sample manufacturing. The following standards must be adhered to:

The SDS must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any issues such as negative test results or wrong parameters/processes, the SDS must submit a detailed test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals to address solutions (ensuring milestones and target observation). The first sheet of the report must clearly state OK or NOK results.

### Analyses and Test Reports
The SDS is required to provide measurement reports (VF Standard VFDST00008900 [43]) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during prototype generations. After individual tests, the test samples must undergo detailed analysis. The measurement and test results must be documented with individual values and handed over to the responsible VinFast department for release.

Upon request, the results, along with the documentation of the tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections conducted parallel to development), are to be submitted to the specialist department responsible for approval. Tests performed parallel to series production must be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.

### Test Report Information

### Virtual Testing
Suitable calculation methods are to be used with adequately detailed calculation models created to secure, verify, and effectively optimize component properties defined in the technical specification, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations. Specific requirements relating to the mechanical properties of the component, such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, are to be secured through FEM calculations.

Tool-dimensioning for injection molding is to be optimized by corresponding simulations. Upon request, operative calculation models representing the development status must be made available to VinFast's requesting technical departments for internal calculations and integration work.

The supplier must provide suitable FEM models without extra cost, upon request from VinFast.

Tests conducted by the supplier according to the evaluation plan must be calculatively documented (e.g., via FEM) before tool dimensioning. FEM models prepared by the supplier should follow VinFast's requirements.

Resistance of the console to extraordinary forces.
Page 39
Requirement: During 2 seconds:

### Mechanical Integration Tests  
The following tests will be performed as mechanical integration tests in a complete car:  
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100) [32].  
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800) [37].  
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000) [48].  
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00008500) [36].  

Basically, no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range is allowed. In particular, the behavior has to be preserved by using materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients.  

The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.  

The component tests shown are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed upon between VinFast and SDS and will be binding.  

If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department have to be provided free of charge by the SDS.  

### Geometrical Integration  

#### General  
Refer to General Engineering Requirements for Suppliers.  

RPS (reference position system): The classification of the testing range occurs in a functional area. The purpose of the determination concept is to have a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly process for assembly and component parts determination. An RPS concept for the design must be completed with quality assurance in the SE process.  

The RPS determination concept forms the basis for the function of components and assembly. Part positioning to adjoining components must be handled according to the RPS system and VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28], taking into account the interior and BIW departments.  

#### Tolerance Analyses  
Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single components and complete systems, including BIW and attachment points:
