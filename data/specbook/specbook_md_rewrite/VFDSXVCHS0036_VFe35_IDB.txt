### VinFast Management System VFDSXVCHS0036

#### 3.2.4 Function_VAF

1. **AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking):**
   - **Shorter stopping distance:** Approximately 1.8 meters shorter stopping distance with an initial speed of 40 km/h compared to standard ESC.
   - **Reduced collision speed:** At 1g deceleration, approximately 16 km/h speed is reduced at the last moment.
   - **Less accidents:** AEB-Pedestrian with e-Booster's fast pressure build could avoid more than 50% of all frontal pedestrian accidents (with standard ESP avoiding approximately 1/3 of all accidents).

2. **Re-generative Braking:**
   - By controlling the boost force, the e-Booster is able to maintain consistent pedal feel independent from master cylinder pressure, even within jump-in zones.

##### Figure 3: Function illustration of hydraulic and regenerative braking forces.
This figure demonstrates the distribution of forces within hydraulic braking and regenerative braking processes. It highlights how the e-Booster ensures consistent pedal force across varying braking modes.

**3.2.4 Function_VAF**
1. **AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking)**:
   - Shortened stopping distance: Approximately 1.8 meters shorter with an initial speed of 40 km/h compared to standard ESC.  
   - Reduction in collision speed: At 1g deceleration, approximately 16 km/h speed reduction at the last moment.  
   - Reduction in accidents: Fast pressure build-up provided by the e-Booster on AEB-Pedestrian could prevent over 50% of head-on pedestrian accidents (compared to standard ESP at preventing 1/3 of accidents).  

2. **Regenerative Braking**:

- A 4:1 pedal ratio is recommended for better fallback performance compared to a 3:1 pedal ratio.  

---

**3.2.7 Mechanical Fallback Braking Mechanism**
Comparison of fallback performances at 50 kgf pedal pressure using different pedal ratios:  
- **Pedal Ratio 4:1**:
  - Vehicle deceleration: 0.65g (↑).  
  
- **Pedal Ratio 3:1**:

6 Supplier responsibilities.

The supplier is responsible to provide and ensure obligations while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

Customer service requirements:
- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup:** The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  
- **Spare Parts Support Cycle:** The support period of after-sales spare parts shall ensure the life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VinFast ends production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.  
- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts:** The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VinFast after-sales engineering department information regarding the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes BOM tables, part structure and function descriptions, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters such as installation clearance and part performance parameters.  

7 Intellectual Property / Copyright.
