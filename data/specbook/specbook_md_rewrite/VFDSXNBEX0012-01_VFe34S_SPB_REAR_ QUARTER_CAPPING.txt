The component should be capable of performing in all conditions. The dimensions should be stable and shall have no color or gloss change and shouldn’t show any detrimental effect when exposed to extreme conditions from -40°C to +100°C.

**Material Properties**  
Material properties given by the manufacturer normally refer to frequencies in MHz-range and below. For higher frequencies, the material properties differ intensely from data sheets.  

The roughness of the material should be below lambda/10 (≤ ~400 μm).  

Materials used as structure for the bumper/secondary surface shall have the following properties:  
- Synthetic materials with low dielectric loss factors at the specific radar frequency shall be used in order to achieve low transition damping.  
- Synthetic materials with low dielectric constants (εr) shall be used in order to obtain low surface reflection.  

**Painting**  
The secondary surface can, in principle, be painted, but a dedicated analysis and control of the different possible categories of paintings is mandatory to avoid significant performance degradation.  

In general, the secondary surface will carry several layers of primer, paint, and varnishes. These layers, in combination with the structure material, will influence both surface reflection properties and the transmission damping. All kinds of metallic materials prevent or degrade sensor radiation and shall not be used as a second surface.  

Elements containing metallic particles must be verified. The applicability of metallic paintings is dependent on:  
- The metal content (percentage) in the painting  
- The size and shape of the metal particles in the painting  
- Number and thicknesses of different layers of paintings and primers  

The number of painting layers shall not exceed four, considering the maximum one-way attenuation.
