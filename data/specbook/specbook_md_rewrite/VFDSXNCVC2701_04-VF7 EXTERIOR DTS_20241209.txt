Section 202 Front Door Triangle to Front Door Strip. 

The gap target vector is set at XZ with a nominal value of 1.2 and tolerance of ±1.0. The maximum gap is 2.2, and the minimum gap is 0.2, resulting in a DVA measurement of ±1.04. The overall status is G (green), indicating acceptable alignment. The DVA status is A, with an override applied for a reason of <0.05mm. This section is included in the DTS.

The flush target has a nominal value of 0.0 with no tolerance, resulting in N/A for symmetry, maximum, minimum, and DVA measurement. The overall status is marked as G, and the DVA status is blank, referencing no override or inclusion in DTS specific for this measurement.

**Target Measurements:**  
- **Gap:** Nominal value of 4.5, tolerance of ±2.25. Symmetry ranges from 6.5 max to 2.5 min. DVA result is ±2.25. Overall status is G, DVA status is A, and override reason is FINESSE. Include in DTS? Y.

**Comments and Actions:**  
- Section updated to the latest CAD. Gap is 4.5mm, and the measurement is within tolerance conditions (4.5 ± 0.05).  
- New section captures two different nominal gaps on Winglet to BSO (see Section 334: 6mm vs. 4.5mm on 343).  
- Section location updated to clarify interface. Initial section suggests 4.6mm; re-check in Catia for actual location.  
- CAS intention to have a larger gap at the bottom compared to the top (Section 334). Engineering agrees to finesse the measurement gap.
