The Supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.

#### b. Test report(s) and Certificate(s)
The Supplier is responsible for ensuring that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests the Supplier to conduct tests as specified in certain UN-ECE regulations at authorized technical services. The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.

VinFast also requests that the Supplier provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings, to be submitted to the relevant authorities to obtain certification for the EC vehicle type approval (if applicable). 

The Supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

#### c. Duty to notify VinFast of non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations
Notwithstanding certification of a product, the Supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in the motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. 

The Supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such issue within five working days after determining the existence of non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
