5 Description and scope of work.

5.1 Technical requirement.

5.1.1 Project Requirements.

5.1.1.1 Quality Requirements.

Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements.”

The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistic specifications, etc.).

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.

The finished assembly should meet all dimensional and form tolerance according to VFDST00000013.
- The assembly structure should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.
- Should be designed for high-volume production.
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime.
- Emit no disturbing noises.
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.

5.1.1.2 Certification.
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report. 
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing. Component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. Suppliers must complete all component/subsystem tests.
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.

5.1.2 General Description of the System / Component  
It must be ensured at all times that VinFast can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.  

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification have to be agreed between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.  

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:  
- System-specific requirements  
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of system markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.  

For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time-schedule.  

The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.  

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of system markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class B and C common platform. VinFast shall also monitor ongoing changes of rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.  

The supplier delivers the system as a module (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated).  
Add-on parts are:  
For the release documentation, the following sheets and documents are necessary:  
- Drawings  
- Simulations  
- Quality regulations  
- Results/documentation of test validation

- For corrosion reasons, parts must be loaded in covered areas protected from the weather (rain, snow). Parts must be transported in closed transport vehicles (e.g., trucks with tarpaulin).

**General Requirements:**
For the determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosively position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosively Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosively Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
3. **High Corrosively:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
Page 17
5.4 Traceability  
For part requirements, please refer to VinFast standard VFDST00010501.  

**Labeling of Parts:**  
The supplier must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010.  

6 Testing and Validation and DVP&R.  
DVP and PC test responsibilities follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for System, Sub-system & Component Level must align with Complete Vehicle Specification Book during the concept phase.  

Detailed test plan for hardware tests is documented in the DVP&R file and must involve collaboration with the Testing & Validation department, including:  
- Declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirements.  
- Description of testing setup, including devices used and pictures of the testing setup.  
- Location of testing (internal/external).  
- Duration and timeline of testing (presented in project plan form).  
- Part variant and description of part.  
- Number of tested components/parts.  

**Mileage Target Life:**  
Ensure the component achieves a mileage target life of 160,000 km or 10 years, whichever comes first.  

**DVP for this component:** N/A  

7 Function Safety, Homologation, and Safety Regulations  
Safety is one of the key issues in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety specifically addresses E/E systems.  

**7.1 Functional Safety Requirements:**  
- The supplier must ensure developed/manufactured parts meet IATF 16949:2016, which specifies Quality Management System requirements for automotive production.  
- The supplier must ensure developed/manufactured parts meet ISO 26262:2018 standards for Road Vehicles – Functional Safety.  

**7.2 Deliverables for Functional Safety:**  
Deliverables for functional safety are based on indicative RASIC*, detailing the expected outputs.

Page 19
The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.

### 7.3.1 North America

#### a. Homologation and safety regulation activities
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., European Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS).

#### b. Self-certification and test report(s)
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale.  
VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.

(*) Refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer Handbook.

#### c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
