Recycling scheme.

This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling scheme has to be provided to environmental experts team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

Pyrotechnic initiator neutralization.

To ensure a cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided for, via the diagnosis interface / central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks / check of deployment per component).
- After deployment of the pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that shall be classified, according to the status of the respectively valid waste legislation, as toxic waste or hazardous substances (otherwise the components shall be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances).
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and / or directly at the vehicle / via the feedback at the deployment tool).
- Marking of positions of pyrotechnical components (especially "hidden" components, e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest).
- In case of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is required. In this case, pre-dismantling, if technically possible, shall be avoided (accessibility of fasteners).

Eco-Design.

Parts marking.

Parts marking should be carried out using the rule "as few characters as possible but as many as necessary." The marking consists of brief type designations which have been defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for "more than" (>) and "less than" (<).

Lifecycle Analysis.

Not applicable.

Emissions & Toxicology.

Harmful substances in components and materials.

The emission behavior of the E/E product with direct contact to the interior compartment has to be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment have to be minimized accordingly. Required measurements for confirmation of the emission characteristics have to be done by the supplier in agreement with the specialist department of VinFast. The measurements have to be done at testing.
Page 40
5.17 Mechanical Requirements.

5.17.1 Load.

**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast.  
The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.

**Special events:**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.

**Misuse events:**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned such that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or at neighboring components (principle "deformation before break").

5.17.2 Vibration Behavior.

**NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior:**  
The maximum vibration level is to be defined by the supplier (brackets must be developed to avoid resonances below a certain frequency).  
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 35Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VF.  
Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.
Page 41
### 5.17.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.  

### 5.17.4 Deformation  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.  

### 5.17.5 Pressure  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.  

### 5.17.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance  
**Fan**  
If the electrical control unit contains cooling fans, no tonal frequency bands are acceptable (adjacent bars must not exceed 3dB).  

**Audio Acoustics**  
- Leakage and rattle-free mounting of speakers must be possible (wide basket mounting interface, foam ring attached to basket, rigid basket material).  
- Basket front side must allow sealed connection to the speaker grille (i.e., through flat surface or foam ring attached).  
- Components must remain stable over time without deformation or shrinkage due to temperature, moisture, dirt, or UV radiation. Glues must maintain specified adhesion, particularly for membranes, suspension, voice coil, dust cap, and membrane glue.  

**S&R, General**  
Noises perceived by customers as disturbing must be eliminated through suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier must guarantee components are free of disturbing noise in their vehicle environment and geometrical integration.  
- No squeaks or rattles are allowed from wind load, torsional flexing, or any real relative movements along surfaces.  
- This assurance extends over the entire operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).  

To ensure freedom from disturbing noise:  
- Requirements must be coordinated with the responsible testing team.  
- The supplier must actively support vibration and acoustic behavior evaluation, provide free parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation, and proactively propose solutions.
