### Functional Description
Sill Inner Reinforcement are first mounted on the Side Sill BIW Frame of the vehicle (LH & RH), and Sill Cover (Rocker Garnish) are mounted on top of Sill Inner Reinforcement. They have an interference fit with Wheel Arch Liners, Wheel Arch Cladding, and Aero Deflector Pad.

Sill Inner Reinforcement are non-grained and non-painted parts (PP-GF30). 

The component should be capable of performing in all conditions. The dimensions should be stable and shall have no color or gloss change. It should not show any detrimental effects when exposed to extreme conditions ranging from -40°C to +120°C.
