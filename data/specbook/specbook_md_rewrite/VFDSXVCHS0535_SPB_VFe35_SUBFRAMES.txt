11 Production quality.

11.1 In Process testing.  
In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuing improvement. Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan. When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked.  

The table that follows summarizes the various IP tests and the acceptance parameters for each. They form the basis on which to develop a complete Control Plan for these and their related significant process characteristics. The Control Plan will include frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.  

**Table of Tests:**  
- Refer DVP for all tests.  
- Material Test.  
- Environmental Test.  
- Component / System Level Testing.  

11.2 Visual Inspection.  
All parts will be 100% inspected in the formed condition, after heat treatment, and after machining at the time of packing. No surface defects (cracks, notches, malformed areas, etc.) are allowed. These allowable surface defect standards should be made available to the appropriate inspectors and operators at the various manufacturing facilities. The following applies to all surfaces unless otherwise noted.  

11.3 Dimensional Control.  
The production supplier has ultimate responsibility to write the Control Plan and to identify significant characteristics (SC) over and above the significant and critical (SC, CC/) features identified by VinFast. The production supplier is also responsible for establishing initial Process Control and ongoing process capability reporting per VinFast requirement. The Control Plan will identify those features requiring process capability.  

Process capability must be established from 30 pieces randomly selected from a continuous production run of at least 300 pieces. The process capability must meet AIAG PPAP edition 4. Capability data is to be included in the PPAP documentation.  

When process capability has been demonstrated, X bar and R charts must be used for ongoing control of characteristics identified in the Control Plan unless specifically waived by VinFast ATI1. Acceptance of parts by any sampling plan or statistical process control procedure does not relieve the supplier of their responsibility that each part meets all requirements of the purchase order and the component print.  

If any defects are found during the implementation of the in-process sampling plan, the supplier must invoke the reaction plan program specified in the Control Plan. Individual VinFast ATI1 departmental requirements for the acceptability of process capability numbers (Cp, Cpk, etc.) may supersede any general guidelines at any time.  

A documented fail-safe system must be established by the supplier, approved by VinFast, and be in place at all sheet metal fabrication, heat treating, machining, and final assembly facilities/operations to ensure that any non-compliance subframes are removed permanently from the product flow.

12 Quality characteristics and their testing conditions.

12.1 General requirements.
The tests are carried out at room temperature unless specified otherwise / (23 ±5) °C.

12.1.1 Identification marking.
During the manufacturing process, and after quality checks are passed with positive results, each rear axle carrier is provided with standard identification marking. This is mechanically applied by means of an engraving unit in the position according to the drawing. The identification marking must be visible in the installed state and facilitate assignment of the following information:

- Production data: Date of manufacture (see Figure 1).
- Measured values of all features to be measured in accordance with the testing instructions.
- Control data: Inspector, exam results (OK/not OK).
- Reworking data, if applicable: defect location, type of defect, worker, examination results.

Figure 1: Example of standard identification marking.

12.2 Semifinished pipes and sheet metal.
Materials as per component drawings or technical delivery specifications in parts list of the assembly drawing. The requirements according to the standards listed in the drawing or the supplier’s technical delivery specifications apply with respect to the semi-finished pipes and sheet metal, to the extent no restrictions are noted according to the drawing or in this standard. The requirements are particularly to be interpreted with regard to further intended use as a function-critical chassis component.

Verification that the requirements have been satisfied for all component parts is to be provided by means of an "Error! Reference source not found." test report as per DIN EN 10 204.
Page 17
12 Quality characteristics and their testing conditions.

12.3 Surface.

12.3.1 Surface condition.  
Component parts are to be further processed to be free of burs (≤ 0.3 mm as per DIN ISO 13715) and without chips. The requirements as per subsection 2.5.3 apply to the rear axle carrier assembly (before paint finishing). The paint application is to be inspected on the finished part in accordance with subsection 12.3.2. Tool-related markings or defects are permitted up to a depth of 0.3 mm. Minimum wall thicknesses shall not be fallen short of; function shall not be impaired.

12.3.2 Surface treatment.  

12.3.2.1 Requirements.  

**General requirements:**  
VFDST00003500 shall be applied for the pretreatment and cathodic dip painting of steel components. A continuous processing time of the components shall be met via the total processing time in the pre-treatment and painting unit. There shall not be any subdivision of the processing time over the whole production process due to the risk of basic material corrosion. If this requirement is not adhered to, suitable measures shall be taken to prevent basic material corrosion within the storage time. Verifications to this effect shall be documented.

**Surface state of the developing article according to the pre-treatment processes, ie before coating:**  
After the pre-treatment processes, there may be no residues (e.g., branded oils / lubricants) present on the surface which have a negative effect on the subsequent processes. A check can be made, for example, in accordance with the ASTM standard (water-breaking test). Silicate and smoke residues (scaling) and impurities in the front and back areas around the welding seams as well as the heat-affected zones around them must be removed to such an extent that the formation of an all-over phosphate layer is possible.

**Phosphating:**  
Subsequently, a phosphate surface coat with a coating weight of 5 ±3 g/m² shall be applied to internal surfaces, external surfaces, and welding seams. For hollow profiles, an immersion process is absolutely required. Thick-layer cathodic dip painting with edge optimization shall be applied. The following coating thicknesses must be adhered to:  

| Surface Type | Minimum | Target Value | Maximum |
|--------------|---------|--------------|---------|
| Outside      | 35 μm   | 40 μm        | 50 μm   |
| Inside       | 20 μm   | -            | -       |
| Edges        | 8 μm    | -            | -       |

The maximum thickness for external surfaces only applies to the bolting areas marked according to the drawing. Minimum paint coat thickness at the edges shall be verified. Burrs shall comply with VDI guideline 2906 sheets 1 and 2. There shall not be any defective e-coating locations (e.g., missing ventilation holes, output holes, and coating holes). E-coating contact points shall be placed so that they are covered later in the assembly.

**E-coating drying at object temperature:**  
Minimum temperature: 165 °C with a 15-minute baking duration.  
Maximum temperature: 200 °C with a 10-minute baking duration.  
For details, refer to the e-coating supplier baking window. The e-coating paint must be fully cured.

12.3.2.2.2 Checking of pre-treatment process regarding silicate residue on the welding seams.
One silicate residue over a welding seam length of 50 mm is permissible if its diameter is not larger than 3 mm. For welding seams shorter than 50 mm, one silicate residue with a max. diameter of 3 mm is tolerable. The permissible values along a 50 mm long welding seam can be adjusted to other surface forms or can be built up from several individual parts.

12.3.2.2.3 Check of phosphating.
- **Location of measurement:** Measuring of the coating thickness (quantity test), see DIN EN ISO 9717 at reference plates.
- **Shape and specification:** Shape and specification of the crystal structure, see component drawing (quality test).
The comparison between quality test and quantity test has to be done by a SEM-comparison.

- **Edge corrosion:** 5% corrosion is permissible; rusty water is not evaluated. Each edge is assessed individually in 100mm segments.
- **Welding seam corrosion:** All accessible welding seams must undergo testing across their full length with the adhesive tape pull-off test as per VFDST00044500. For welding seams:
  - A maximum of one delamination over a 50mm seam length is permissible if the delamination diameter does not exceed 3mm. 
  - For seam lengths shorter than 50mm, one delamination with a maximum diameter of 3mm is allowed. 
  - Adjustments to permissible values can apply to other surface forms or constructions from individual parts. 
- **Degree of corrosion on the inner and outer surfaces:** Corrosion levels must not exceed ≤ Ri1.

|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Partial air bubbles             | Mechanical removal of the paint coat with manual sander and sand paper; followed by manual paint finishing or a renewed cataphoretic dip painting run. Manual paint finishing shall only be carried out with a VinFast approved acrylic paint or brushing coat as per RAL 9005, color tone 900.                                                                      |
| Flowering, orange skin, coat thickness or solvent content excessive (defect partial, large-size or on complete rear axle carrier). | Chemical rear axle carrier paint removal and renewed cataphoretic dip painting within 12 h. The requirements as per VFDST00007000 - LA SW 3 apply with respect to repainting.                                                                                                                                                                      |

Systematically paint defects are generally not allowed. All reworked axle carriers have to fulfill the requirements as per subsection 12.3.1 and 12.3.2 without restrictions.

12.4 Dimension inspection.  
The specified dimensions and geometric tolerances according to the drawing and/or according to the testing schedule, as well as any other requirements specified in the drawing, are to be inspected on the finished component. The measuring programs are to be coordinated between the supplier and VinFast Quality Assurance with respect to the sampling points on the component and the auxiliary or measurement recording. A measuring reference sample with barcode (component) number {to be defined} is available from the supplier.  

Test dimensions as per the testing schedule (all characteristics) are to be met with a **Cpk value of > 1.33.** Changes are to be coordinated with the specialist department responsible for release.

12.5 Welded joint.  

12.5.1 Welding technique.  
Shielding gas arc welding (SG) as per VFDST00001201-02-03.  

12.5.2 Weld quality.  
The basis for assessment of the welds are the reference samples available at VinFast and the Benteler.  

- Limiting values of the irregularities for the respective assessment group according to the drawing: as per DIN EN 25 817.  
- Assessment of the weld thickness in relation to the angular range on the welded joint: as per DIN EN 25 817 or according to the weld joint reference list dated {date and reference serial number to be added}.  
- Penetration depth ≥ 5% of wall thickness.

12.5.3 Testing.
a) Visual inspection.
The individual welds are to be examined by means of visual inspection in accordance with the requirements under subsection 12.5.2 (characteristics for external examination results). Faulty welds can be rewelded (see subsection 12.5.4).  

b) Macrosection.
The assessment of characteristics for penetration and internal examination results of the weld seams in accordance with subsection 12.5.2 is carried out by means of macrosections; cutting levels according to the released weld drawing (Page 2).

12.5.4 Reworking of defects.
If parts are singled out during visual inspection (see subsection 12.5.3) that, with respect to external examination results of the welds (inadequate weld, varying leg size, undercutting, end crater pores), are not carried out with the weld quality in accordance with the assessment groups in the drawing as per DIN EN 25 817 or with the deviations permitted according to the drawing, these can be manually rewelded by trained welders or by automated means while adhering to the following criteria:

**Weld preparation:**  
- In the event the first weld is interrupted, the seam ends and beginnings of the defects are to be partially ground. Other weld defects are to be removed. Grinding of the base material is not permitted.

**Rewelding:**  
a) Only one rewelding operation is permitted per weld. In the case of surface pores, a second reworking operation by means of manual welding is possible in exceptional cases.  
b) Rewelding must correspond to all requirements according to the drawing and this standard in terms of the welding technique and also the external and internal examination results of the weld.  
c) The drawing dimensions (geometry), with the exception of the "a" dimension, must lie within the dimension tolerances after rewelding.  
d) The bond to the first weld or to the base material must be ensured.

**Table 2:**
| Defect                     | Reworking                                          |
