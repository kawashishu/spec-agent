5.1 Technical Requirement.

Refer Part Data Sheet for details: VFSRXVBEX0047_PDS_BEV_GAP_HIDER_V01_2020.07.04.

5.1.1 Function.
The function of this part is to cover the gap between the HV Battery and the Underbody Body in the Side Sill area. The part is located in the wet area of the vehicle and exposed to the environment. Suitable rigid PVC (black color) sheets must be used for vacuum forming of the parts. Recycled material is permitted to save costs. The supplier must submit the technical data sheet of the raw material and the manufacturing process layout along with the quotation.

5.2 General CAE Requirements.

Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL, which outlines VinFast General FE Modeling and Analysis requirements established to support the VinFast Statement of Requirement (SOR). Finite Element Modeling requirements apply specifically to Project VINFAST.

5.3 Material Requirement & Corrosion.

Refer Table 1 (see 5.1) for detailed technical specifications.

VinFast requires a clear determination of corrosion requirements, classified for each component in the system into four categories based on exposure:
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default classification for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default classification for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

General Requirements:
- Vehicle exterior is considered an area with high corrosivity.
- Material combinations must prevent galvanic corrosion. Fasteners and brackets must be properly coated (paint, plastic coating, or insulating spacers) if material combinations are critical.
- Ensure drainage at lowest positions to avoid water and dirt accumulation. Avoid dirt traps where sand can act abrasively against painted surfaces through micro movement.
- Contact surfaces on the body must remain dry, be sufficiently large for low pressure, and composed of non-abrasive materials to minimize micro-movement.
- Ensure burr-free edges with paint systems exhibiting good edge coverage.

5.1.1 Function.
The function of this part is to cover the gap between the HV Battery and Underbody Body in the Side Sill area. The part is located in the wet area of the vehicle and exposed to the environment. Suitable rigid PVC (black color) sheets must be used for vacuum forming the parts. Recycled material is permitted to save costs. The supplier must submit the technical data sheet of the raw material and the manufacturing process layout along with the quotation.

5.2 General CAE Requirements.
Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL Statement of Requirement (SOR) Specification Book. VinFast General FE Modelling and Analysis Requirements are defined within this document for Finite Element Modelling Requirements to support VinFast SOR. The range of validity is specifically for Project VINFAST.

The reproduction, distribution, and utilization of this document, as well as the communication of its contents to others without express authorization, is prohibited. Offenders will be held liable for the payment of damages. All rights reserved in the event of the grant of a patent, utility model, or design. Nothing in this standard supersedes applicable laws and regulations.

5.3 Material requirement & Corrosion.
Refer to Table 1 (see 5.1). 

Material requirements and corrosion specifications must align with VinFast Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers. The determination of corrosion requirements involves classifying the corrosivity positions for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used for positions not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used for positions moderately affected.
3. **High corrosivity:** Default classification for exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very high corrosivity:** Reserved for positions directly impacted by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations must ensure galvanic corrosion does not occur, with coatings or insulating measures applied as needed. Prevent water and dirt accumulation, provide drainage at low points, and avoid abrasive traps. Ensure paint systems have good edge coverage and burr-free edges.

5.3.1 Corrosion tests.
Parts must pass system/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests. Key tests include:

- **Salt spray test:** ISO9227. Acceptance criteria are based on specific standards, avoiding red rust.
- **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B. Acceptance criteria detailed below.

Test criteria:
| Area                       | Corrosivity    | Metallic coatings         | Organic coatings           | Pass criteria                 |
|----------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts    | Low            | 240 h NSS -> ISO9227      | 96 h -> ISO6270 CH         | No red rust                   |
| Exterior, wet areas        | Medium/High    | 480 h NSS -> ISO9227      | 5–10 cycl. CCT -> ISO11997 | NSS: No red rust CCT: See below |
| High visible areas         | Very high      | 720 h NSS -> ISO9227      | 10 cycl. CCT -> ISO11997   | + stone chipping protection |
| Stainless steel            |                | Avoid galvanic corrosion; insulating coating is needed. |

Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT include:
- **Rust creep** (ISO4628-8): ≤ 4mm for galvanized steel, ≤ 1–2mm for non-galvanized/aluminum steel.
- **Blistering:** Size ≤ S2 (ISO4628-2).
- **Edge corrosion:** ≤ 10%.
- **Weld seam corrosion:** ≤ 5%.
- **Degree of rusting:** ≤ Ri 1 (ISO4628-3).

Components must undergo testing as assembled sub-systems wherever feasible, simulating their installed positions on the vehicle.

**Aluminium parts:**  
Aluminium parts in high visible areas have to be painted or anodized.  
Test criteria Painted Aluminium: See test criteria for organic coatings.  
Test criteria Anodized Aluminium: 480h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.  
Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.  

**Chromed metal parts:**  
240h NSS ISO9227 without base material corrosion.  

**Chromed plastic parts:**  
CASS-Test according DIN EN ISO 9227; duration:  
- 48h for Exterior  
- 24h for Interior  

Acceptance criteria: No surface defects.  
Also: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.  

**Electric parts:**  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (type Gortex), when in wet locations.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.  
Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners, etc., that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.  
The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  
**Terminals, connectors:** Do not place terminals on the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is a requirement for tightness: Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  
**Groundings:** Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.  
**Aluminium/sealing surfaces:** Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.  

**Prevention of stone chipping issues:**  
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures.
