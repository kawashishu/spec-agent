5. Description and scope of work  

5.1. Technical requirement  

5.1.1. Project Requirements  
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing, and component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.  
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. The supplier must complete all component/subsystem tests.  
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, by designated sub-suppliers or third parties.  
- In any event, the supplier is obligated to complete all specified test requirements.  
- The component/subsystem supplier must provide VINFAST's product release engineer with a complete component/subsystem test certification plan approved by the engineer. The plan shall include at least: number of samples, test sequence, place, and time of each test.  

5.1.2. General Description of the System / Component  
It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.  

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification have to be agreed upon between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.  

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:  
- System-specific requirements.  
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of system markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.  

For technical proposals that exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time-schedule.  

The technical and commercial release will be proceeded with by the customer according to change management.  

Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all law requirements of system markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the class.

5.1.5. Performance Specification.

5.1.5.1. NVH and Driving Comfort.

The system must not cause any kind of disturbing sound, including relative movement, wind noise, squeak, rattle, temperature effects, and flexural torsion during any operation. The system must remain free of annoying noise under vehicle and audio system excitation across all environmental conditions throughout the fixed component service life. Additionally, there must be no squeak or rattle noise caused by wind load, flexural torsion, or other body excitation, even if there evolve real relative movements on the surface. This requirement must hold under all operating and environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity. Noise-free performance requirements must be aligned with the responsible testing team.

Noise during driving operations must be avoided, even after climate-change tests. No noise is allowed at any operating position across the entire temperature range.

5.1.5.2. Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability).

Operational strength of the complete vehicle and its subsystems must be verified, ensuring sufficient performance for vehicle-typical conditions. Product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile must be considered and verified. Requirements must be defined to guarantee sufficient operational strength across the complete vehicle, subsystems, and components. This technical specification serves as the basis for system and component technical specifications. Mounting force must be less than dismounting force.

5.1.6. Weight Management.

Vehicle weight significantly influences energy consumption. The primary goal of weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight. Throughout the development process, weight optimization for all components must be prioritized. Suppliers must identify all weight reduction potentials, highlighting their implications for cost, timing, and quality.

### 5.1.15.3. Recycling

#### Recycled materials
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  
Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recycles and post-production recyclers, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts-marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert’s team at VINFAST.

#### Recycling scheme
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  

The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  

Recycling schemes have to be provided to the environmental experts’ team at VINFAST before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

A RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process.  

The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS-system VFDST00000011 [34] according to the interior and BIW department.  

#### Tolerance analyses  
Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems, including BIW and attachment points:
