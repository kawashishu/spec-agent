**5 Description and Scope of Work**

**5.3.4 Emissions & Toxicology**

**5.3.4.1 Odor**

Interior parts emissions (bag method).  
The emissions of interior components, semi-finished products/auxiliary means, and surface materials (foils, artificial leather, films) have to be checked according to standard ISO 12219, part 2 ('bag method'). The fulfillment of a target value for interior part emissions according to this specification book has to be proved by the supplier via measurements which are defined by VinFast.  

Harmful substances in components and materials.  
The emission behavior of the product has to be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment have to be minimized accordingly. Required measurements for confirmation of the emission characteristics have to be done by the supplier in agreement with the specialist department of VinFast. Measurements must be done at testing institutes approved by VinFast. It is recommended to obtain an overview of all approved testing institutes from VinFast.  

Volatile organic compounds of components have to be checked according to ISO 12219. The conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured through the complete product life cycle. The test result is evaluated by the specialist department of VinFast. In any case, the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health has to be attested in written form on demand. The supplier has to provide measurement results regarding VOC and Fogging for the materials before the milestone purchase release.

**5.3.5 HC Emissions**

**5.3.5.1 Fundamentals**

Compliance with legal and client-specific emission standards, i.e., adherence to thresholds for the vehicle and specifications for the vehicle interior must be guaranteed.  

The safety of volatile substances and compliance with VFDST00007601, VFDST00007602, VFDST00007604, "Hazardous Materials" is to be confirmed in writing. Development and subsequent series production aim at the lowest possible HC emissions of the component. The respective current VinFast VFDST00007601, VFDST00007602, VFDST00007604, "Hazardous Materials", must be complied with during the service life.

The supplier must submit a component description “Component description for recording HC emissions" to the relevant design department as early as possible. Illustrations of the development scope are to be added if available. At each change to materials or processes, the part description is to be updated and submitted to the relevant design department for coordination.

IMDS material data sheet and EC safety data sheets are to be provided to the quality department for approval of chemical products.

The supplier must carry out measurements as required as proof of emission properties in coordination with the quality department for plastics development and process technology. The measurements must be executed by testing institutes recognized by VinFast. It is recommended to obtain a current list of recognized institutes from the quality department.  

**5.3.5.2 Total HC Emissions as per CARB**

The scope of development described in this Requirements Specification (ZB seats rear including all adjoining parts) is to be measured in new condition based on VFDST00031102.
Page 11
### SEAT FOAM PADS

#### 5.3.5.2 Total HC emissions as per CARB  
The target value for new condition is 4 mg for all rear seats. When subsided, the emission value must not exceed 0.4 mg. Subsided condition begins one year after completion of the component and lasts until the end of the service life. Supply thresholds for both conditions throughout the duration must be agreed upon with the Quality and Design departments, with test frequency determined.

**General note:**  
If thresholds may be exceeded during measurements as per VFDST00031102, a screening analysis should be executed to optimize components or materials.

---

#### 5.3.5.3 Volatile substances, sum of volatile substances, odor  
**General guidelines:**  
Volatile substances in materials within the scope of development should be tested on representative components using thermo desorption [8], formaldehyde determination [10], and odor analysis [9]. Test results must align with more realistic and complex processes, where applicable, such as [11]. 

- **Odor assessment (measurement [9]):** Grade of odor improvement must score better or equal to 3, ensuring no unpleasant smell.  

**Requirements for development scope in this specification:**  
The ZB for rear seats, including all adjoining components, shall be measured as per [13]. This involves using a test chamber to measure emissions from components, semi-finished products, and materials.  

**Target value for new condition:**  
- Sum of volatile substances:  
  - Less than **25,000 µg/m³ Toluol equivalent**.  
  - Or less than **15.5 ppm Propane equivalent** (FID-Wert) in a **1 m³ chamber**.

When target values are exceeded, the Plastics Development and Processing department must collaborate to determine corrective measures.

   - Relevant laws, standards, etc., impacting the development of control systems.
   - Known hazards and failure modes.  

NOTE: The specification of the scope of supply defines the functions, properties, and boundaries of the items or elements requested from the supplier.  

c) The safety goals or the set of relevant safety requirements:  
- Including their assigned ASIL, if already available, and dependent on the supplier's quote.  
- If ASIL is unknown at the time of supplier selection, a conservative assumption can be made.

b) Specification of the scope of supply:  
   - "List" of all the elements of the item.  
   - Use some form of block diagram(s) (functional and/or physical) showing:  
     - Significant elements.  
     - Key relationships between them.  
     - Interfaces with external elements (typically other vehicle systems).

   - Safety Goals & Functional Safety Requirements and associated attributes. Safety goal requirement ONLY case where the requirement may state what not to do.  

FTTI: attribute of the safety goal as well as a safe state.  
ASIL: attribute of the safety goal.  

System requirement:  
- No signal name per se should appear in the requirement, only physical entities (speed, accel, yaw, etc.) as controlled or perceived by the user of the system or information entities (e.g., accel pedal) if the item is a subsystem of the vehicle.  
- Requirements may be assigned to subsystems already or only to the systems (i.e., refer to the system as per ISO definition and defined in the item definition).  
- FTTI: most of the time inherited from the safety goal. Potentially the FTTI is already decomposed (see below ASIL decomposition).  
- ASIL: likely no ASIL decomposition at that stage but possible if the item is a subsystem of the vehicle interacting with an existing subsystem to mitigate a risk (e.g., Distributed safety architecture).  

For example: The VCU (vehicle subsystem) will detect any excursion of the vehicle acceleration and will shut down the electric machine torque in case of a detected hazardous scenario.

7 Supplier responsibilities.  
The supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.  

### Customer Service Requirements.  
**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall not be shorter than 10 years after VINFAST starts production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.  

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as:  
- BOM table.  
- Parts structure and function description.  
- Fault diagnosis.  
- Special tools for maintenance.  
- Relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).
