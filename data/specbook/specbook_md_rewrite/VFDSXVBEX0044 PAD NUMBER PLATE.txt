5.3 Material Requirement & Corrosion.

Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC ("VinFast").

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/ dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/ dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).

**Additional guidelines for corrosion prevention:**
- Avoid water and dirt accumulation, and always provide drainage at the lowest positions.
- Avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body due to micro-movement.
- Contact surfaces to the body must be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive materials to minimize micro-movement.
- Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

**Corrosion Tests:**
- **Component Tests for Metallic Surfaces:**  
  Salt Spray Test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria as detailed below.

- **For Organic Coatings:**  
  Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, with acceptance criteria as detailed below.
Page 9
Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test criteria:
**Area**: Interior, mounted parts, dry area  
- **Corrosivity**: Low  
- **Metallic coatings**: 240 h NSS (ISO 9227)  
- **Organic coatings**: 96 h (ISO 6270 CH)  
- **Pass criteria**: No red rust  

**Area**: Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, wet area  
- **Corrosivity**: Medium  
- **Metallic coatings**: 480 h NSS (ISO 9227)  
- **Organic coatings**: 5 cycles CCT (ISO 11997 Cycle B)  
- **Pass criteria**:  
  - NSS: No red rust  
  - CCT: See below  

**Area**: High/Not visible for customer  
- **Corrosivity**: High  
- **Metallic coatings**: 480 h NSS (ISO 9227)  
- **Organic coatings**: 10 cycles CCT (ISO 11997 Cycle B)  

**Area**: High/Visible, very high  
- **Corrosivity**: Very high  
- **Metallic coatings**: 720 h NSS (ISO 9227)  
- **Organic coatings**: 10 cycles CCT (ISO 11997 Cycle B)  
  - Additional stone-chipping protection where needed  

### Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT:
- **Rust creep** (according to ISO4628-8):
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1–2 mm  

- **Blistering**: Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  

- **Edge corrosion**: ≤ 10%.  

- **Weld seam corrosion**: ≤ 5%.  

- **Degree of rusting**: ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).  

**Stainless Steel:**  
Avoid direct contact with other metals to prevent galvanic corrosion; in most cases, an insulating coating is required.
Page 10
Test criteria for high visible parts: 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check especially areas with crevices. Execute component tests with assembled sub-systems, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

### Aluminium Parts
- Aluminium parts in high visible areas must be painted or anodized.
- **Test Criteria for Painted Aluminium:** Refer to test criteria for organic coatings.
- **Test Criteria for Anodized Aluminium:** 480 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.
- Execute component tests with assembled sub-systems, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

### Chromed Metal Parts
- 240 h NSS ISO 9227 without base material corrosion.

### Chromed Plastic Parts
- **CASS Test** (According to DIN EN ISO 9227):
  - Duration: 48 h for exterior.
  - Duration: 24 h for interior.
  - Acceptance criteria: No surface defects.
- Additionally, 240 h NSS ISO 9227 without surface defects.

### Electric Parts
- Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, must be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (e.g., Gortex) when installed in wet locations.
- Material combinations must prevent galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and attached brackets. Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in wet environments.
- Steel fasteners must have a long-term corrosion-resistant surface treatment compatible with other materials.
- Electrical components must be installed such that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.
- **Terminals and Connectors:** Should not be placed at the lowest points. Corrosion protection requires tightness. Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.
- **Groundings:** Connecting surfaces must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.
- **Aluminium/Sealing Surfaces:** Avoid using aluminium alloys with copper and iron content > 1% for sealing surfaces, as they are very sensitive to corrosion. Corrosion can penetrate seals quickly, allowing moisture to enter.
Page 11
Prevention of stone chipping issues: The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures as follows:
- Provide shielding parts for easily damageable components wherever possible.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can reduce severe damage risks.
- In high stone-impact zones, utilize materials and paints of matching colors to minimize visible abrasion marks.
- Develop parts without edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements located at lower areas: recess or deepen them to prevent easy stone hits.

5.4 Traceability For part requirements follow specifications outlined in VinFast standards VFDST00010502 and VFDST00010501.

5.5 Labeling of Parts Suppliers must adhere to VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Labels should be positioned clearly on parts, accompanied by setup pictures for reference.

5.6 Vehicle Architecture The complete vehicle must adhere to requirements derived from vehicle layout plans. Changes to parts or modules impacting vehicle dimensions or geometric coherence must be immediately communicated to VinFast for evaluation. Specifications for vehicle interior and exterior dimensions align with guidelines defined in GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.

Styling Technique Convergence Suppliers must inform VinFast of any changes impacting exterior or interior styling surfaces for evaluation. Technical inputs to aid styling evolution loops—including tooling demands and assembly sequences—should be provided by suppliers based on module-specific requirements as defined by VinFast. Technical inputs may take the form of office documents, 3D CAD data, or sectional files.

9 Supplier responsibilities.

The supplier is responsible for providing and ensuring compliance while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

### Customer service requirements

**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period for after-sales spare parts shall not be shorter than 10 years after VINFAST starts production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST's after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as:  
- BOM table,  
- Parts structure and function description,  
- Fault diagnosis,  
- Special tools for maintenance,  
- Relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).
