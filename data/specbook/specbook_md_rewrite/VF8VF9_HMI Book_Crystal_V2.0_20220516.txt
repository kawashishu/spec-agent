### 10.2 Highway Autopilot  

**Function description**  
Highway Assist (SAE Level 2) is a driver assistance system that controls acceleration, deceleration, and steering control in highway scenarios. It supports drivers during not only the monotonous highway drive but also traffic jam conditions to guarantee a safe and comfortable trip.  

**Operation:**  
- A dedicated right steering wheel button to activate HWA.  
- Deactivation via cancel button or brake pedal.  
- Operation in right steering wheel buttons for speed and gap increase/decrease.  
- When the HWA condition is met, the MHU will display a grey icon to indicate function availability. Pressing the steering wheel button engages the function, and the icon in MHU changes to blue.  
- The first press of the cancel button will deactivate the current working HWA; pressing this button a second time will resume the function with the latest setting.  
- When HWA is activated and the car stops due to traffic jam, the car will keep hold for a certain time. Pressing the resume button or the accelerator pedal is required to re-activate the HWA.  
- When HWA is activated, a short press on the speed gap setting button increases/decreases speed by 1 km/h; a long press increases/decreases speed by 5 km/h.  
- If no lane is detected, HWA will degrade to ACC.
