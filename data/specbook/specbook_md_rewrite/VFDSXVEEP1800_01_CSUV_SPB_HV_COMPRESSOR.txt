1 General Document Guidelines.

1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.
This version is legally binding.  
This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard. Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g. what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g. level 3 vs level 2 -> level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English.  
All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document:

- **Shall**  
  The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.  

- **Should**  
  The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.  

- **May**  
  The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

4.2.2 Mounting.

Customer has the responsibility to mount the EVH33X in their vehicle to avoid opportunities of noise and vibration generation, failures by compressor corrosion, etc., but here are some general requirements:
- The EVH33X shall be mounted by all three (3) M8 bolts - All must be properly torqued.
- The EVH33X shall be mounted on a big mass like the Engine or Motor Drive unit. Do not mount the EVH33X on something unstable like a chassis frame.
- If the EVH33X is mounted by a compressor bracket, "mounting natural frequency of the compressor with bracket" shall be designed to be sufficiently high (over 300Hz).
- Information regarding Center of Gravity (CG) and Moments of Inertia for the EVH33X is provided in the figure to assist the customer in designing the compressor bracket.
- If an isolation mounting bracket is utilized, an additional ground strap from the EVH33X to the chassis GND is required.
- The EVH33X shall not interfere with other vehicle parts (except the mounted portion).
- The suction and discharge lines shall not interfere with other vehicle parts (except connected portions).
- The EVH33X shall be mounted in a position where it will not be immersed and where splash exposure is limited.
- The EVH33X shall be mounted in a position to minimize potential damage as a result of collisions.
- The EVH33X shall be mounted within the required mounting angles provided in Figure 3.5 to ensure proper functioning of the oil separator.

4.2.3 Discharge Temperature.

The EVH33X shall be operated with the discharge temperature below:
- Less than 140°C (Steady state).
- Less than 150°C (Transient state).

4.2.4 Super Heat.

The EVH33X shall be operated with the compressor suction super heat exceeding:
- More than 5°C.

4.3 HVAC System. 

4.3.1 High Side Pressure Protection.

The maximum allowable discharge pressure of the EVH33X is 2.8MPaG. The customer shall provide proper "high side pressure protection" and prevent the compressor from operating beyond 2.8MPaG at the discharge point. A high side pressure sensor or switch shall be installed on the compressor discharge line (as close to the compressor as possible) before the condenser inlet for this function.

4.3.2 Low Side Pressure Protection.

The minimum recommended suction pressure for the EVH33X is 0.18~0.2MPaG. Although the EVH33X could operate at 0.06MPaG for short durations, it is highly recommended that the customer ensures proper "low side pressure protection" to prevent operation under 0.18~0.2MPaG at the suction point. A low side pressure sensor or switch shall be located on the suction line (as close to the compressor as possible). In cases where the low side pressure sensor or switch is not installed, at least an “evaporator frost protection” provided by an evaporator air-thermistor or fin-thermistor shall be alternatively applied. The customer must additionally confirm this measure will prevent evaporator frost under all conditions and that it never allows the compressor to operate under negative pressure.

4.3.3 Low Refrigerant Charge Protection.

The customer shall implement a proper “low refrigerant charge protection” system to prevent the compressor from operating under unusually low refrigerant charge conditions. The customer may use either a low side pressure sensor, a high side pressure sensor, or a combination of both for this purpose.

### Figures and Behavior Description
**Over Voltage Protection and Under Voltage Protection**  
The EAC stops operation of the motor and sends an error message to the vehicle via LIN communication bus simultaneously in the event that the voltage deviates from the normal voltage area. After the voltage recovers within the recovery voltage range, the EAC resumes operation.  

**Motor Current Over Current Protection**  
The EAC immediately stops the motor operation upon detecting overcurrent conditions to ensure the IGBT current remains within allowable limits, sending an error message to the vehicle via LIN communication bus. If repeated occurrences happen, the EAC recognizes these as Compressor Failures and permanently stops motor operation.  

**Input Current Over Current Protection**  
Similar to Motor Current Over Current Protection, the EAC halts motor operation upon detecting overcurrent input conditions. Behavior is outlined in the figure provided.

### Diagrams

1. **Behavior of Over Voltage Protection and Under Voltage Protection:**
   The accompanying figure illustrates the behavior of the EAC when voltage values deviate from the normal voltage area. During such events:
   - The compressor shuts down and becomes inoperative.
   - Error messages are sent to the vehicle via LIN communication bus simultaneously.
   - The motor resumes operation after voltage stabilizes within the recovery voltage range.

2. **Motor Current Over Current Protection:**
   The accompanying figure illustrates how the EAC handles motor current over current conditions:
   - The motor operation halts immediately upon detecting an over current event in order to prevent IGBT current from exceeding the allowable limit.
   - Error messages are sent via LIN communication bus.
   - If this situation repeats, the EAC identifies the compressor as failed and will permanently cease its motor operation after 10 occurrences.

3. **Input Current Over Current Protection:**
   - The figure demonstrates that the EAC halts motor operation when detecting an input current over current scenario and communicates the error via LIN communication bus.

4. **Behavior of Over Temperature and Lower Temperature Protection:**
   - A detailed illustration shows the EAC stopping motor operation and sending error messages via LIN communication upon detecting temperature limits.
   - Motor operation resumes once temperature stabilizes below recovery levels.

5. **Behavior of High Voltage Resonance Protection:**
   - An associated figure shows motor speed adjustments upon detecting voltage oscillations that exceed allowable values.
   - The EAC gradually reduces oscillation of voltage and subsequently increases motor speed to the target value once stabilization occurs.
Page 26
**5.3.2.1.3.5 Protection Description**
The EAC includes multiple built-in protections to prevent internal or system damage under defined circumstances. The protections are:

1. **No.11, Over Power Protection**:  
   The EAC reduces motor speed when either "allowable power consumption" or "input current" exceeds specified limitations. This helps lower power and current levels. Once allowable power consumption decreases below the defined limitation, the EAC increases motor speed back up to the target speed.  
   - Behavior illustrated in Figure:  
     - *Abnormal Operation*: Exceeding power/current limits leads to degraded operation mode.  
     - *Recovery*: System releases from abnormal conditions and resumes target speed.  

2. **No.12, Over Motor Current Protection by IGBT Temperature**:  
   The EAC evaluates IGBT temperature and adjusts allowable current limits accordingly. Based on detected temperature, the motor operates within constrained current and temperature limits.  
   - Behavior illustrated in Figure:  
     - *Degraded Operation*: Controlled motor speed adapts to manage IGBT current and temperature.
     - *Recovery*: Compressor status returns to normal after temperatures stabilize within allowable limits.
Page 27
5.3.2.1.3.5 Protection.

The EAC has built-in protection to prevent internal or system damage under specific circumstances. The protections include:

1. **High Voltage Over Voltage Protection** (> 465V for 3 seconds or > 480V instant).
2. **High Voltage Under Voltage Protection** (< 270V for 3 seconds or < 230V instant).
3. **Internal 15V Power Supply Under Voltage Protection**.
4. **Internal 15V Power Supply Over Voltage Protection**.
5. **Motor Current Over Current Protection** (> 60A for 3 seconds).
6. **Input Current Over Current Protection** (> 29A for 3 seconds).
7. **Circuit Board Lower Temperature Protection** (≤ -15°C for 1 second).
8. **IGBT Over Temperature Protection** (≥ 135°C for 1 second).
9. **Capacitor Over Temperature Protection** (≥ 125°C for 1 second).
10. **High Voltage Resonance Protection** (Oscillation of Voltage ≥ 33V).
11. **Over Power Protection** (Inverter Input Power ≥ 6500W or Inverter Input Current ≥ 28A).
12. **Over Motor-Current Protection by IGBT Temperature**.
13. **Rotor Lock Protection**.
14. **Slugging Protection**.
15. **Lost Communication Protection**.

Any of these protections cause the compressor to shut down operation if the specified condition exists. The recovery conditions for each protection vary depending on the nature of the event. Below Table outlines the recovery conditions, EAC status, and protections during various stages.

### Protection Mechanisms.

**No.1–2, Over Voltage and Under Voltage Protection**  
Below figure illustrates the behavior of Over Voltage and Under Voltage Protection. The EAC halts compressor operation and sends an error message via LIN communication if the voltage deviates from the specified range. The compressor resumes operation when the voltage recovers to the defined recovery range.

**No.5, Motor Current Over Current Protection**  
The EAC stops motor operation immediately upon detecting overcurrent to prevent IGBT current from exceeding allowable levels. An error message is sent via LIN communication. If repeated, the EAC recognizes compressor failure and will permanently stop after 10 consecutive events.

**No.6, Input Current Over Current Protection**  
The EAC stops motor operation upon detecting input current exceeding allowable levels. Error status is conveyed via LIN communication.

**No.7–9, Over Temperature and Lower Temperature Protection**  
Operations are halted if temperature exceeds allowable limits or becomes too low. Error messages are sent via LIN communication. The motor resumes operation after recovery within allowable temperature ranges.

**No.10, High Voltage Resonance Protection**  
Motor speed is adjusted to reduce high voltage oscillation exceeding the allowable limit. Regular speed resumes once oscillation falls below permissible levels.

**No.11, Over Power Protection**  
Motor speed is reduced if power consumption or input current exceeds allowable limits. Speed returns to normal upon recovery.

**No.12, Over Motor Current Protection by IGBT Temperature**  
EAC adjusts motor operation based on detected IGBT temperature and permissible current thresholds.

**No.13, Rotor Lock Protection**  
Motor halts if the rotor fails to rotate due to mechanical failures or inability to reach specified revolutions within a particular duration. Error message is sent via LIN and motor remains inactive temporarily.

**No.14, Slugging Protection**  
Motor speed increases to optimal levels calculated based on required torque in cases where liquid refrigerant fills the compressor.

Diagram descriptions for significant protections:

1. **Over Voltage and Under Voltage Protection:** The EAC stops motor operation and sends an error message to the vehicle via the LIN communication bus if voltage deviates from the normal range. Recovery occurs within the recovery voltage range.

2. **Motor Current Over Current Protection:** The EAC stops motor operation if overcurrent is detected to prevent IGBT current from exceeding allowable levels. Compressor stops permanently if the situation occurs repeatedly 10 times.

3. **Input Current Over Current Protection:** The EAC stops motor operation when input current exceeds the allowable level and sends an error message.

4. **Over Temperature and Lower Temperature Protection:** The EAC stops motor operation and sends an error message when temperature exceeds or goes below allowable limits. Recovery occurs when temperature returns to acceptable levels.

5. **High Voltage Resonance Protection:** The EAC reduces motor speed if voltage oscillation exceeds limitations and increases speed when oscillation returns to allowable values.

6. **Over Power Protection:** The EAC reduces motor speed when power consumption or input current exceeds allowable limitations. Recovery occurs when reduced to acceptable levels.

7. **Over Motor Current Protection by IGBT Temperature:** The EAC operates motor speed within allowable current and temperature limits based on detected temperature of IGBT.

8. **Rotor Lock Protection:** The EAC stops motor operation and sends an error message if the rotor fails to rotate continuously or reach specified revolution after a duration.

9. **Slugging Protection:** The EAC increases motor speed under optimum calculated conditions when the compressor fills with liquid refrigerant.

10. **Lost Communication Protection:** The EAC stops motor operation when LIN communication between the vehicle and EAC fails for a specified time.

- Transmit Message and Signal Definitions

Transmit Message contains the following 2 frames. The details of each frame are as follows:

<EAC_1>  
This frame contains 10 signals which convey the operational status back to the commanding controller:

• **EAC_CompStat**  
This signal is responsible for indicating whether the compressor is operational and/or operating at full capacity. There are 3 possible values: $0 = Normal Operation, $1 = Degraded Operation, $2 = Inoperative.  

• **EAC_CompElecCurr**  
This signal contains the value of the high voltage DC input current measured within the EAC. The resolution is 0.2 Amp per bit.  

• **EAC_CompElecCurrV**  
This signal is a binary signal that indicates whether the above signal “EAC_CompElecCurr” has been calculated appropriately or has any underlying errors. A value of “0” indicates valid data, whereas a value of “1” indicates that the data should be ignored.  

• **EAC_CompSpd**  
(Details for this specific signal are not provided in the visible image.)
Page 32
- Transmit Message and Signal Definitions.

Transmit Message contains the following 2 frames. The details of each frame are as outlined below.

<EAC_1>  
This frame contains 10 signals, which convey the operational status back to the commanding controller:  

• **EAC_CompStat**  
   This signal is responsible for indicating whether or not the compressor is able to operate and/or operate at full capacity. There are 3 possible values: $0 = Normal Operation, $1 = Degraded Operation, $2 = Inoperative.  

• **EAC_CompElecCurr**  
   This signal contains the value of the high voltage DC input current measured within the EAC. The resolution is 0.2 Amp per bit.  

• **EAC_CompElecCurrV**  
   This signal is a binary signal indicating whether the above signal “EAC_CompElecCurr” has been calculated and whether any underlying dependencies have errors. A value of “0” indicates good data, and a value of “1” indicates that the data should be ignored.  

• **EAC_CompSpd**  
   This signal contains the value of the actual speed that the compressor is controlling to. The signal has a value of 1 rpm per bit.  

• **EAC_CompSpdV**  
   This signal is a binary signal indicating whether the above signal “EAC_CompSpd” has been calculated and whether any underlying dependencies have errors. A value of “0” indicates good data, and a value of “1” indicates that the data should be ignored.  

• **EAC_CompElecPwr**  
   This signal contains the value of the high voltage power consumption as measured by the EAC. The signal has a value of 40 watts per bit.  

• **EAC_CompElecPwrV**  
   This signal is a binary signal indicating whether the above signal “EAC_CompElecPwr” has been calculated and whether any underlying dependencies have errors. A value of “0” indicates good data, and a value of “1” indicates that the data should be ignored.  

• **EAC_CompSpdIncrReq**  
   This signal is used to aid in extending operation of the EAC under conditions which are causing the EAC to self-protect. A value of “1” for this signal indicates to the commanding controller that the internal temperature of the EAC is rising and that the EAC needs to increase the present operating speed in order to maintain cooling to the internal components.  
   It represents a request to the commanding controller to increase its speed request to the EAC. If the commanding controller accommodates this request, then once the internal components measured temperature/current conditions have returned to safe levels, the value will change to “0” and the commanding controller can return to a lower speed if necessary. If the commanding controller cannot accommodate this request, the EAC will need to eventually shut itself down in order to self-protect.  

• **EAC_CompFltStat**  
   This signal is responsible for providing a brief explanation of why the status of “Inoperative” is being broadcast in the “EAC_CompStat” signal.  

• **EAC_1_LIN_Response_Error**  
   This signal indicates LIN response error. If the value is "1," there is a LIN response error.  

<EAC_2>  
This frame contains 6 signals, which convey some of the compressor’s internal sensor readings:  

• **EAC_CompIGBTTemp**  
   This signal contains the measured internal temperature of the IGBT. This signal has a value of 1 degC per bit and an offset of -40.  

• **EAC_CompIGBTTempV**  
   This signal is a binary signal indicating whether the above signal “EAC_CompIGBTTemp” has been calculated and whether any underlying dependencies have errors. A value of “0” indicates good data, and a value of “1” indicates that the data should be ignored.

| 4      | IL OUT        | Interlock – Out                         |

- HV Connector signal definition:
HVDC Positive (+) and HVDC Negative (-) power from the high voltage power supply is provided through this set of connectors. The shield is terminated to the EAC case (Aluminum body).

- HV shield (EMC) Grounding:
The EAC case needs to be grounded to the vehicle chassis, or a structure designated as the low voltage ground reference for proper EMC protection. Grounding can be accomplished either by direct mounting to the powertrain (via the compressor mounting bolts) or, in the case of an isolation mount for the compressor, via a separate EMC grounding strap. The recommended grounding point on the compressor body is one of the EAC mounting bosses. The ground strap should be affixed between the mounting bolt head and the mounting boss. Use of an EMC ground strap should follow the vehicle manufacturer's EMC requirements for bond impedance of grounding terminations at the chassis connection.

- HV Isolation:
The EAC meets the requirements for High Voltage Insulation Breakdown as specified in UL840. The EAC is tested using a 500-volt maximum input voltage. 100% of the EAC units are isolation tested during the manufacturing process on the production line. Both the high voltage positive bus and high voltage negative bus, referenced to the EAC case, are tested using a test voltage of 500 Vrms AC at 50Hz or 60Hz for 2 seconds. The isolation between the primary (high voltage) circuitry and the secondary (low voltage) circuitry is measured as greater than 10 MΩ.
