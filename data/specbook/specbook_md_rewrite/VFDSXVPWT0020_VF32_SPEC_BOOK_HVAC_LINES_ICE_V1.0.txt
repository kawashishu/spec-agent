### 5.1.1 System description
Cooling and air-conditioning installations utilize the change of cooling agent parameters (pressure, temperature, and state) when it circulates between the evaporator and the condenser in the cooling system. The cooling agent circulates driven by the refrigerating compressor. 

The refrigerant absorbs heat by evaporation in the evaporator, then gives up heat when vapor is condensed in the condenser.  

The objective is to minimize the complexity and high commonality.  

---

### 5.1.2 Package layout overview:
The complete vehicle is still under development. Use dimensions provided as a reference to confirm technical feasibility and provide initial quotation. More accurate dimensions/envelopes will be provided once available.

The system designer has to coordinate all components of the module, considering Packaging, Function, Fixing, and tolerances.  

**Objective:** The design must remain as compact as possible while factoring in low cost and acceptable quality. The supplier is responsible for confirming the most cost-effective alternatives for each variant.

---

### 5.1.3 Function
In these pipe installations, freon (e.g., R134a, R1234yf) mixed with compressor oil (e.g., PAG/POE synthetic oil) acts as a refrigerant. It circulates through the system, undergoing continuous pressure and temperature fluctuations.  

**Requirements Include:**
- AC pipe assemblies must remain perfectly tight since freon is highly penetrating, expensive, and harmful to the environment.
- AC pipes must exhibit resistance to pressure, temperature, chemicals, and prevent humidity from permeating the hose wall.

Functional Responsibility  

- AC pipes and freon rubber hoses operate in the engine compartment, tightly packed and bent, in high ambient temperature conditions, exposed to vibrations, and in contact with car fluids. They should sustain all operating conditions.  
- AC hoses must be made of the highest quality rubber compounds. A thin layer of nylon (polyamide) should be included in the inner layer of synthetic rubber (BARRIER type) to reduce freon permeation to the minimum.  
- Rubber hoses should be manufactured in compliance with standards, e.g., SAE J2064.  
- Typical hoses used in these cars have inner diameters of 8 mm for the high-pressure end and 16 mm for the low-pressure end.  
- The working pressure of freon hoses usually reaches up to 35 bar, with a temperature variation from -40°C to +130°C.  
- Car air-conditioning hoses for freon should be mounted with special fittings. These fittings must be readily available in car service stations as complete hose assemblies. They can sometimes be fixed or replaced, but always with the highest degree of accuracy and care.  
- Rubber freon hoses for car air-conditioning installations should be mounted with special fittings made of aluminum or steel. The type of fitting connection can be individually designed to match a particular type of car.  
- The system must provide for pressure sensor installation points.  
- The system must include charging ports (high/low).  
- Rubber hoses must absorb engine and e-motor rolling without damages or line detachments.  

### Fittings used for AC Pipes and Hoses:  

#### Compressor Discharge and Suction Ports:  
The following information pertains to the discharge and suction lines. Plumbing fittings at these ports are based on the "Standard GM Slim Line Sealing Washer Design." The rubber hose must utilize POE oil-compatible materials.  

**Discharge Side:**  
• **Port**: ½” Seal Washer - Standard Slim Line Sealing Washer. O-ring seals are acceptable to reduce costs.  
• **Hose**: Rubber hoses must utilize PAG/POE oil-compatible materials.  
• **Secure Torque (Recommended)**: 16 ± 4 Nm.

5.1.4 System requirements.

The system supplier must define characteristic curve values to match the thermal and electrical requirements of HVAC components. The following requirements must be fulfilled:
- Geometry.
- Acoustics, vibrations, resonances.
- Life expectancy due to the operational profile.
- Service capability and ease of repair.

### Characteristic curves:
Suppliers must provide characteristic charts. Pipes should be tested to plot the characteristic curves, including pressure against temperature, temperature against electrical inputs, and temperature loss at different points.

### AC refrigerant properties:
Refrigerants used in the AC system are either R134a or R1234yf. Their specific properties are:

#### R134a:
- Air temperature condenser inlet: **35 ± 0.3°C** (maximum 20% RH).

The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and notification obligations must be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier throughout the complete product life cycle according to VFDST00007601.  
IMDS (International Material Data System) material data sheets must be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID according to the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing and Validation) and VFDST00007601, including specific targets on vehicle indoor air quality following VFDSXVCVC3401-VOAQ_Testing_Guideline.

5.4 Appearance Approval – Applicable for All Visible Parts.
Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 (Quality of parts, timing).  
For each step of the process, the supplier is responsible for submitting parts to VinFast quality design, adhering to agreed timing with VinFast, to secure OK shape, OK Technical Goal (OKTG), and AAR approval.  

The process begins early in the PT (Prototype Testing) build phase, ensuring AAR approval by LS (Launch Start). The supplier must incorporate this activity into their development process and Engineering Design and Development (ED&D) cost.

7 Function Safety, Homologation, and Safety Regulations  
Safety considerations are essential in the development and integration of automotive functionalities, focusing on E/E systems.

7.1 Functional Safety Requirements  
Suppliers must ensure compliance with the IATF 16949:2016 standard for quality management systems in automotive production and the ISO 26262:2018 standard for functional safety in road vehicles.

Additional references to system-specific Functional Safety Requirements will be added via MGL and FuSa.

9 Supplier responsibilities.

Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements.**

**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall not be shorter than 10 years after VINFAST starts production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).

10 Intellectual Property / Copyright.
