- **R: Responsible** – This role is tasked with the proper execution of activities to fulfill the requirements. The individual in this role is entitled to request necessary support from other project team members.
- **A: Approval** – Responsible for decisions and releases. If a decider is not explicitly defined, the person responsible for execution (R) assumes this role.
- **S: Support** – Obligated to provide active support, which may include capacity resources, expenses, and/or transfer of know-how.

V. Pyro-Fuse.  
The basic function of this component is the controlled creation of permanent galvanic isolation for HV-safety applications. Like a circuit breaker or fuse, it is a normally closed device, meaning that it conducts current via its two HV contacts (i.e., the copper busbar). When it receives a specific trigger signal, it interrupts the current flow and permanently isolates the two HV contacts from one another. Pyro-Fuse breaks the battery pack connection to the vehicle during a crash. Pyro is activated by ACM (Airbag Control Module).

For the detailed BMS specs, please refer to VFDSXNBAT0008-VF7_BAT_GOTION_BMS_SPB_B Sample.

II. BMS SW Overview.
The GOTION battery BMS software has been designed to be compatible with the existing VF7 vehicle system. This means the same signals in the .dbc file are used to interface with the vehicle system. The diagnostics are similar to the existing VF7 vehicle battery pack but adapted to the GOTION battery pack; therefore, there are specific DTCs added, thresholds have been adapted, and not relevant DTCs have been removed. Due to different battery packs characteristics (different energy, power, and thermal characteristics), a different VCU .cal is expected to be required.

The BMS software shall follow the following VinFast requirements:
- General Diagnostic: Generic Diagnostic Specification VFDSVAEEP0001-V1.6.pdf.

### l. Thermal System & Logic  

#### I. Thermal System  
The battery pack is cooled and heated using a Water/Glycol coolant mix through the cooling Plate. The cooling plate is at the bottom of the battery pack, with the cells glued on top of it.  

**Material:** AI3003 O  
**Manufacturing process:** Stamping + brazing.
Page 75
### Manufacturing process: Soldering and injection molding.

### Details for the plate system:
- **Component Name**: Cooling down plate.
- **Material**: AI3003 O.
- **Mass (kg)**: 5.7.
- **Density (kg/m³)**: 2730.

### Figure 5.60 VF7 Coolant Flow
The coolant volume of the bottom plate on the battery pack is approximately **3.2L**.

## II. Thermal Logic
The BMS thermal logic follows the requirements from the VF Battery team. It sends a signal to the VCU to:
- Turn on/off the **Chiller (Cooling)** or **PTC (Heating)** based on the cell temperature min/max.

Threshold values are calibratable and subject to change. Detailed thermal management strategy can be found in the **VF7 Project thermal strategy_V06_08_21_2024** document.

The BMS sends a signal to the VCU with the required power request, calculated based on:
1. The difference between the **Target temperature** (defined as **25 Degrees**, which is calibratable).
2. The **Inlet temperature**.
