**Generally:**  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosively position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosively Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosively Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High corrosively:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very high corrosively:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

**Corrosion tests:**  
The parts have to pass the complete vehicle corrosion test.

7 Function Safety, Homologation, and Safety Regulations.  
Safety is one of the key considerations in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety relates specifically to E/E systems.  

### 7.1 Functional Safety Requirements  
- The supplier must ensure that developed/manufactured parts meet IATF 16949:2016 standard (Quality Management Systems Requirements for Automotive Production).  
- The supplier must ensure that developed/manufactured parts meet ISO 26262:2018 standard (Road Vehicles – Functional Safety).  
- Compliance with ISO 26262-8:2011 requirement point 5.4.2.2 is required.  

**RFQ Requirements:**  
The RFQ from the customer to supplier candidates shall include:  
a) **Formal Request to Comply with ISO 26262:**  
   - The supplier must ensure parts comply with ISO 26262:2011 standard (for car programs) or ISO 26262:2018 standard (for scooter and bus programs).  
   - The supplier must ensure compliance with IATF 16949:2016 standard.  
b) **Specification of the Scope of Supply:**  

**Cooperation with VinFast Vehicle Safety Department:**  
Suppliers are responsible for supporting vehicle safety function integration actively. Lifetime relevant laws, market ratings, and OEM requirements must be addressed.  

### General Demands  
- Vehicle safety functions must be prepared on a system level using expertise, CAE simulation, and testing.  
- All project-relevant supplier data must be provided to VinFast free of charge upon request. VinFast may forward this data to project-related parties.  
- Target fulfillment with adequate safety margins (spreads in identical test series results) must be ensured.  
- Part/system CAE models must support vehicle data freeze milestones, realized using validated LsDyna and numerical/physical stability.  
- FE meshes must maintain density homogeneity (8–10mm) based on part axles and geometry; re-working is required for non-conforming meshes.  
- Supplier must plan, perform, and finance activities to generate validated CAE material cards (system- and component-level principle tests are mandatory).  
- Full vehicle timing alignment demands a defined supplier test matrix with optimization test series completion before higher-scale testing phases (sled or vehicle crash tests).  
- Free-of-charge provision of specific parts for testing at project facilities, including physical parts and CAE models (supplier bears associated costs).  
- Full vehicle crash optimization requests must be implemented without extra costs, including specifications for material definitions, material thicknesses, and optimization work.  

#### General Requirements  
- A mandatory 20% safety margin is applied to each target value.  
- Occupant survival integrity concerning part behavior and fluids includes safety under direct/indirect contact.  
- Minimum edge standard: no edges below 3.2mm during/after impact.  
- Electrical system integrity during impact and post-crash operations.  
- Robustness in target achievements with tolerances considered.  
- Asymmetry verification on all sides until the worst-case scenario is confirmed.  
- No modification allowed affecting ratings.  

Specific requirements include tracking actions of concerned parties for observed issues (e.g., parts/data/CAE models from further suppliers). Moreover, unfinished parts must be finalized for testing setups (e.g., sled).  

**Homologation:**  
The supplier has to provide necessary homologation certificates and data free of charge upon fulfilling system-level targets.  

#### Carry-Over Parts:  
Fulfillment can be demonstrated using donor vehicle performance data.  

8 Active Pedestrian Safety System (APSS).  
Actuators are vital for the APSS, ensuring the hood is in an upright position during impact to protect pedestrians. Parameters include piston stroke, piston force, and retaining force (see section 2.3.3). The activation force must avoid hood oscillation due to excessive energy input but still prevent dummy-induced hood movements pre-impact.  

**Environmental and Function Range:**  
- Operation validated within -30°C to +85°C with 10%–95% relative humidity.  
- Hardware testing must ensure activation time and required forces are achieved across temperature and humidity limits. Testing includes climatic chambers, fall towers, high-speed videos, and force/time metrics.  

Brackets must resist activation forces without significant plastic deformation. The hood-popping function stability during fixation bracket deformation must be retained.  

Suppliers must:  
- Deliver testing components for optimization.  
- Provide technical support via specialists locally during testing and troubleshooting.  

#### Safety Goals and Functional Safety Requirements  
Requirements include assigned ASIL levels. Conservative assumptions may be used if the ASIL level is unavailable during supplier selection.  
- Attributes related to the safety goal such as FTTI and ASIL must be specified.  

**Additional Context:**  
- Physical entities (e.g., speed, acceleration) or information entities (e.g., accelerator pedal) are central to requirements definitions via ISO standards. FTTI attributes often derive from safety goals and may be decomposed (see ASIL decomposition below).  

**General Notes:**  
Requirements aim at ensuring full compliance. Homologation documents or system-level certificates are to be provided free of charge to VinFast.
Page 20
ASIL: It is possible that no ASIL decomposition occurs at this stage, but it can be achieved if the item is part of a vehicle subsystem interacting with an existing subsystem to mitigate a risk (e.g., in distributed safety architecture where the VCU detects vehicle acceleration excursions and shuts down the electric machine torque during a hazardous scenario).
