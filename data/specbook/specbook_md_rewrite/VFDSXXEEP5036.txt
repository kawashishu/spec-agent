1 General Document Guidelines.

1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.  
This version is legally binding.  
This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard.  

Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other.  
All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).  

1.2 Language.  
This document is written in English.  
All official project documentation has to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.  

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.  
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.  

Shall.  
The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.
Page 7
Should. The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.

May. The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

2.1 Development Scope Abstract.  
This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the USB Sockets. The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics. The contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements. Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details must be reported immediately. The contractor is a ‘Full Service Supplier’, with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

2.2 Initial Situation and Objective.  
The USB Socket is a new development component that controls the charging process of attached USB peripherals. Through testing and vehicle performance verification, this product is intended to meet the performance design requirements of the socket.

2.3 Classification of the System / Component.  
| No | Part Name                        | Part No.      | Qtty | Purchase Level | VFe36 ECO | VFe36 PLUS |

2.4 Execution Regulations.  
The supplier must ensure that the developed parts meet the specified requirements of VinFast, obtain type certifications for the parts, and submit all necessary documents to support type certification of the whole vehicle. Upon completing synchronous development, suppliers must provide necessary documentation to prove their compliance with required regulatory requirements, including but not limited to ISO26262.

2.5 Development and Supply Scope.  
The supplier status is "Full Service Supplier," meaning the supplier has complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries. This responsibility includes:  
- Defining, developing, and 3D-designing all parts within the system.  
- Creating release drawings.  
- Ensuring system functionality.  
- Performing required simulations or calculations at the system level.  
- Validating the system according to the technical targets and tests specified.  
- Ensuring proper system timing concerning project management, development, and industrialization.  

The agreed work-share is documented in section 2.5.1. The main supplier obligations are described in the Work Interface Chart (RASI).

VinFast is responsible for the integration and certification of the vehicle-grade system. Vehicle-level certification projects include urban simulation road tests and enhanced road tests. Suppliers of spare parts/subsystems will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found in the process of integration and certification of the vehicle-level system. All countermeasures to resolve issues addressed in the failure report must be executed by the supplier and approved by PPAP.  

The integration and certification of components/subsystems is the responsibility of the supplier of components/subsystems. The supplier must complete all parts/subsystems tests.  

The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or by the supplier appointing a lower supplier or a third party after VinFast approval. However, in any case, the supplier is obliged to complete all specified test requirements.  

The supplier of parts/subsystems must provide the VinFast Product Release Engineer with a complete test certification plan for parts/subsystems and obtain the approval of the Engineer. The plan should include at least the number of specimens, test sequence, place, and time of each test.  

2.9 Quality and Reliability.  
2.9.1 Quality Concepts.  
The supplier must satisfy the quality commitment made to VinFast, which is to guarantee 100 waste products per 1,000,000 pieces of spare parts sent to VinFast. PPM ≤100, CPK ≥ 1.33.  

2.9.2 Risk Management.  
The supplier shall notify the VinFast Product Release Engineer in writing of any potential technical matters, such as problems, accidents, latest information, project changes, etc., which may lead to increased costs, delays in project nodes and plans, and delays in delivery dates. The supplier written notice should include a specific repair plan and a risk assessment and description of the overall project schedule.  

2.9.3 Validation of the SW Development.  
The supplier shall regularly report to VinFast the relevant design input factors and provide engineering support. At the same time, suppliers should attend supplier development meetings and complete necessary design validation.  

If there are inconsistencies with the specified specification requirements, the supplier should work with VinFast to solve the problem. Suppliers also need to provide VinFast with competent on-site service personnel to support VinFast in resolving problems associated with supplier parts in vehicle assembly during the vehicle start-up phase.  

2.10 Content Amendments.  
The supplier shall notify the VinFast Product Release Engineer in writing of any potential technical matters, such as problems, accidents, latest information, project changes, etc., which may lead to increased costs, delays in project nodes and plans, and delays in delivery dates. The supplier written notice should include a specific repair plan and a risk assessment and description of the overall project schedule.
