**Common Information for Front & Rear Door:**  
**Function Requirements:**  

(Functional details for doors listed above are referenced in related documents.)
Page 14
Most important functions of door trim:
- Covering of DIW and other systems according to styling requirements, considering targets of legal/market requirements.
- Tightness against water, air leakage, dust.
- Noise absorption.
- Absorbing properties in case of side impact.
- Integration of add-on parts.
- Providing full functionality over a lifetime.

Overall function:
Primary targets for the development of the ASM door trim are:
- Avoidance of functional and qualitative problems from known systems. Use of standard parts and common parts where possible and convenient. Process reliability in manufacturing, packaging, transport, and assembly.
- Minimize effort of overall production sequence: production, packaging, transport, and assembly on the line.
- Prevention of displacement. Integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of the part package (Simultaneous Engineering) from the concept phase onward. Early inclusion of the developers of neighboring components (body shell, inner side finisher, etc.).
- General reduction in cost as compared to the predecessor model.
- Further improvement of the acoustic, optical, and functional characteristics.
- Functionality has to be ensured within a temperature range of -30°C (-5°C for Vietnam market) to +85°C.
- Support of side airbag performance.
- Support of sound performance.
- Fulfilling ergonomic requirements.
- Sufficient clearance between door trim and seat adjustment devices, minimum of 70 mm.

Stiffness / rigidity / stability of shape:
Especially in the area of the operating elements, the door trim assembly has to assure that no instability is noticeable.
Page 15
### Irregular Shapes and Design Prohibition
Irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, and visible waviness under climatic change loads are prohibited.

### Door Trim Requirements
No detaching, fracturing, or splitting of parts is allowed, neither during crash tests nor airbag deployment, even in low-temperature ranges.

### Materials
- Material and production-compliant design layout of the components to avoid production-related surface flaws or defects, including tool parting points/lines, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, and stress zones.
- Material-compliant fits, curvatures, and corners, allowing visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces.
- Uniform, proportionally accurate, and material-compliant run-out of component edges, corners, and ribs.
- Selection of concepts and production methods that facilitate homogeneous structures and grain patterns.
- Avoidance of visible screw points, screw point covers, and dummy covers.
- Surfaces free of burrs in visual and haptic zones.
- Prevention of visibility for other parts (through grilles, trim covers, indentations, joints, and cavities), ensuring neat and tidy overall impressions.
- Ensuring correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts to minimize disturbance noise.
- Free of disturbing noise and odors in contact with the environment.
- Surfaces must comply with ISO 1302 standards for design.
- Tightness of the door panel must be ensured; uncomfortable airstreams to passengers are not allowed.

### Coordination and Approval
To coordinate the form and surface:
- Corresponding samples, including Cubing reports and Appearance Approval reports, must be presented to VinFast approval offices.
- Reports include references such as VFDST00038400, Color Matching/Appearance Approval, and VDA280 part 1.

### Variants
- The full range of functional variants is outlined in the Feature List VF Hoa Update XXXXXXXX (or newer versions).
- Variants in color, surfaces, and material are described in a separate color and trim specification.

Performance Specification.

NVH and Driving Comfort.

Complete Vehicle NVH and Driving Comfort Targets.  
The vehicle shall enable an acoustics and vibration comfort which is well balanced with vehicle dynamics and drivability. It ensures long-distance driving comfort as well as driving over rough roads. This requires the absolute absence of squeak and rattle issues under all load cases (speed, maneuver, temperature, etc.).

Supplier Responsibility.  
The validation of NVH and driving comfort will be performed on the complete vehicle level and comprises real customer operation conditions. Before complete vehicle validation occurs, the supplier must ensure the readiness of components and systems for durability testing. Evidence of test maturity of components must be reported in the DVP&R (Design, Verification, and Development Report) at the component level.  

System suppliers are required to perform validation activities as specified in technical specifications. All parts required for validation activities must achieve the defined maturity level. VINFAST will define quality criteria and validation methods for alignment with suppliers. Active cooperation with the development team and manufacturing departments is mandatory. Root cause investigations and compliance with complete vehicle NVH targets at component and system levels are required.

Components must be free of squeak and rattle noises during all vehicle operation conditions, including audio acoustic excitation. Robustness of design must be reported virtually and during hardware phases before serial release. Actuation noises must not be audible and must represent high-quality integration in the vehicle, under all specified environmental and thermic conditions.

During serial manufacturing, a capable quality assurance process must ensure the quality level consistently. Suppliers must provide components for testing and NVH tuning while facilitating local testing and troubleshooting processes.

Page 33
Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:
Rust creep according to ISO4628-8:
- Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
- Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.

Blistering:
- Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).

Edge corrosion:
- ≤ 10%.

Weld seam corrosion:
- ≤ 5%.

Degree of rusting:
- ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

The interior is basically considered as a dry area, which means areas with low corrosivity. Exceptions might include the floor area or areas where wetness/abrasion by shoes or drinking juices could cause corrosion.

If combining different metals, avoid galvanic corrosion by coating such parts. Edges, especially painted edges, shall be burr-free to ensure good edge coverage and avoid wear.

Seat structure (uncoated blank steel):
- At least new parts must be corrosion-free. Further, the areas with corrosion risk must not be visible to the customer. Extreme positions of the seat rests must be considered. 

On other invisible areas:
- The test criteria may be lower than the above-mentioned requirements. It must be ensured no corrosive products appear in visible areas and the full functionality over the lifetime of the part is assured.

Vehicle tooling:
- Usually stored in the trunk and considered to have low corrosivity exposure. For tool surfaces with wear, the corrosivity might be medium.

See also:
- Corrosion requirements on Electric Components.

Test plan:
The test plan regulates:
- By whom and when the testing will be done.
- Which testing devices are necessary.

This plan also shows:
- The results in good visual state.
- The progress of testing.

Controlling the test results must be ensured at all times. If VINFAST wants verification of test results on its own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and documentation must be approved by:
- The corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST.

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly during the testing phase, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

Responsibility:
- The responsibility for complete safeguarding of components lies with the SDS.
- Testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing if negative results occur on committed parts.

- Part variant, part description.  
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is required to utilize the DVP&R template supplied by VINFAST's testing department. Responsibility for content lies with the SDS. A DVP should be established for each development stage, prototype (if listed in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

**Testing Sequence and Coordination**

The sequence and quantity of test specimens must be defined in cooperation with VINFAST validation engineers and component lead engineers. The test plan must be jointly approved by VINFAST and the SDS. Weekly reviews of DVP&R post-concept confirmation (milestone CC) are mandatory. Any scheduling delays require SDS proposals to meet commitments.

Upon request, SDS must provide test plans for individual components.

### Testing Specifications

**General Testing Requirements**  
The SDS must prepare detailed, backdated testing plans aligned with the vehicle timing chart. Testing should focus on worst-case component and system variants to ensure robust validation.
Page 35
In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible. Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS have to be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered by the SDS from VINFAST.

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge. The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for only their component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VINFAST requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VINFAST.

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved. All tests must be documented according to VINFAST standard, alternatively to SDS standard if this is accepted by VINFAST. The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification. The tests have to be brought in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.

Samples for sample inspections are to be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (coordinated with the test department). VINFAST Logistics determines the number of sample parts. VINFAST Purchase orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to the DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS.

In case of any problems (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the SDS must submit a test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions to keep all milestones and observe all targets. 

An "OK" or "NOK" result needs to be stated on the first sheet of the report. 

### Analyses and Test Reports
Page 36
The SDS must provide measurement reports according to VINFAST specification (VFDST00008900) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts. After each individual test, samples must be analyzed in detail. Measurement and test results must be documented in a test report, which must be submitted to the responsible VINFAST department for release. Upon request, results and related documentation of parallel testing (during development and production) must also be submitted to the responsible specialist department. Regular or required intervals must be maintained for planned and documented series production tests.
