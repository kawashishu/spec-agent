11.1 In Process Testing  
In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuing improvement.  

Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan.  

When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked.  

The table that follows summarizes the various IP tests and the acceptance parameters for each. They form the basis on which to develop a complete Control Plan for these and their related significant process characteristics.  

The Control Plan will include frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.

11 Production Quality.

11.1 In Process Testing.  
In-process (IP) tests are utilized to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuous improvement. Tests must be conducted with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics are included in the Control Plan. During process instability or unmet test acceptance criteria, the reaction plan defined in the Control Plan is implemented.  

Sampling plans must define frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans based on acceptance criteria, forming the framework of the complete Control Plan.

11.3 Dimensional Control.  
The production supplier has ultimate responsibility to write the Control Plan and identify significant characteristics (SC) beyond those identified by VinFast. The supplier must establish initial Process Control and ongoing process capability reporting per VinFast requirements. Process capability must be demonstrated using 30 randomly selected pieces from a continuous production run of at least 300 pieces, meeting AIAG PPAP edition 4 standards. Capability data must be included in the PPAP documentation.  
X bar and R charts must be used for ongoing control of identified characteristics unless waived by VinFast ATI1. Acceptance through sampling plans does not relieve the supplier's overall responsibility for meeting component requirements. If defects arise, the supplier must invoke the reaction plan specified in the Control Plan.

Individual VinFast ATI1 departmental requirements may override general process capability guidelines. The supplier must establish a fail-safe system approved by VinFast to ensure non-compliant parts are permanently removed throughout forging, heat treating, machining, and assembly processes.

11.4 X-RAY Inspection for Porosity, Voids, & Cracks (Applicable for Casting).  
1. X-ray testing for internal discontinuities must be performed after casting, as defined in the process control plan. During PV and IP-I stages, specific acceptance standards for critical areas susceptible to internal discontinuities (porosity, shrinkage, inclusions) must be developed and approved by VinFast ATI1. Standards must align with ASTM E155 & E505 references and production control plans.

2. Operators performing x-ray inspections must have training for flaw interpretation consistent with EN 473 or ISO 9712 certification standards. Evidence of training must be available for inspection by VinFast STA/ATI1.

3. X-ray testing equipment must detect discontinuities greater than or equal to ASTM E155 & E505 Plate 1 standards for critical areas. Both film and real-time x-ray systems may be used if proven capable of resolving defects at required accuracy levels.

4. X-ray inspection systems must allow manual inspection of all component areas as necessary. Automatic defect recognition systems may be used if their capability matches that of trained inspectors during the ‘run at rate’ phase for the applicable component.

11.5 Fluorescent Dye Penetrant for Surface Defects (Casting/Forging) (crack check)

1. A fluorescent dye penetrant test for cracks and surface discontinuities will be performed on all exterior part surfaces per ASTM E165 (method A) and ASTM E433.
   
2. Operators must receive appropriate training in interpreting potential flaws with the particular equipment chosen for the production dye penetrant inspection procedures in accordance with EN 473 (General principles for qualification and certification of NDT personnel) or ISO 9712 (Non-destructive testing - Qualification and certification of personnel). Evidence of this training shall be held on file for inspection by Vinfast STA / ATI1.

3. Specified defects may be checked for severity by grinding removal if the following conditions are met:
   - a) The removal method must be proven not to mask the defect to the fluorescent dye penetrant detection.
   - b) The depth of removal must not create any stress raisers or thin out any wall thickness below the as-cast print specified minimum. The surface finishes after any material removal must be fine enough such that no notches are created which could initiate fatigue cracks (this is defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1mm and/or root radius less than or equal to 5mm).
   - c) The depth of removal must not violate the part print tolerances.

4. If any defects in excess of the maximum allowable values and/or acceptance standards are found, refer to the reaction plan within the Process Control Plan.

5. All parts inspected during IP-II phase must be shown to be free from defects, for a period of 90 days in order that this requirement is revoked. Otherwise, dye penetrant inspection shall continue until ATI1 / STA is satisfied that this process is no longer necessary.

11.6 Feature Removal Standards & Surface Finish (Castings/Forging)

1. The maximum allowable flash will be no greater than 0.5 mm; a chamfer allowance of 2 mm (max) is acceptable to accommodate this requirement. The use of controlled grinding operations on the part is approved for flash and sharp edge removal in order to ensure safe part handling. In any areas where flash or other defects are removed, the minimum wall thickness detailed on the part model must be maintained. In addition, the surface finish after any material removal must be fine enough so that no notches are present which could initiate fatigue cracks (this is defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1mm and/or a root radius less than or equal to 5mm). In general, the removal of any material from a part must not compromise the part function.

**As-cast surface roughness shall be less than or equal to cast surface Rz < 50, web & fettled areas Rz < 50. Equivalent specification to be followed for forged surfaces.**

   - Once sufficient data has been collected to show adequately reproducible mechanical properties throughout the heat treat lot, and upon agreement with VinFast ATI1/STA, the sample size will be reduced to two test bars from one pair (4 total) per heat treat lot.
3. All tensile bar sizes and types should conform to BS-EN 10002-1. Testing should be performed with 6mm gauge diameter specimens for consistency. All other sample dimensions are to be derived from the BS-EN standard.
