3.10 Non-Functional Requirements.

**3.10.1 Isolation Co-ordination (Clearance & Creepage).**
- Follow IEC60664-1 Clearance to withstand Impulse Voltage.
Page 15
### Table F.2: Clearances to withstand transient overvoltages

This table outlines the minimum clearances in air up to 2,000 meters above sea level for transient overvoltages based on specific conditions. The clearances are categorized under Case A (inhomogeneous field) and Case B (homogeneous field) with different pollution degrees (2 and 3) defined. 

#### Key Observations:
- For impulse voltage of 2.5 kV under Case A with pollution degree 2, the required clearance is 1.5 mm.
- For impulse voltage of 2.5 kV under Case A with pollution degree 3, the required clearance is also 1.5 mm.
- For impulse voltage of 2.5 kV under Case B with pollution degree 2 or 3, the required clearance remains 1.5 mm.

#### Notes:
1. This voltage is specific to functional insulation and includes the highest impulse voltage expected within the system circuit. 
2. Pollution degree references (and interpolated values) help determine reduced withstand characteristics under certain conditions (IEC 60664-5). 
3. The minimum clearance values under pollution degrees 2 and 3 consider humidity-exposed environments.
4. For parts subject to impulse voltages, interpolation of values is acceptable with guidelines specified further in section 4.2.3.
5. Pollution degree 4 clearance dimensions are designated to be greater than 1.6 mm.

This table serves as a standardized reference for interpreting the appropriate impulse voltage and clearance specifications required for compliance.

The battery management system (BMS) represents the main control unit on which all system information is gathered and the operating strategy is defined. It provides the communication between the internal components of the high voltage battery pack (HV Pack) as well as an external communication interface via CAN (PT – CAN). The BMS shall be able to sense thermal parameters related to the thermal coolant inlet and outlet temperature and pack mean temperature, identify the thermal power demand, coolant flow rate required to operate the battery pack at the target temperature, and send this information to the external thermal control unit (VCU).

The HV Battery thermal system shall support in:
- Keeping the battery cells in 20°C–35°C cell temperature range (ideal without running into thermal derating) while charging from grid and driving.
- Bringing cell temperatures into 20°C–35°C cell temperature range in 30 minutes time after temperature soaking to low/high temperature.

**Recycling**  
**Dismantling scheme:**  
The dismantling scheme which must be provided by the supplier has to show a simple, unmixed dismantling of the component as well as its accessibility when assembled. Additionally, information regarding joining techniques, dismantling tools, etc. must be stated in the dismantling scheme/dismantling concept.  

Dismantling schemes must be provided on demand to the environmental specialists at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

**Recycled materials:**  
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  

Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g. recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) must be preferred with respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials must be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert’s team at VinFast.  

**Recycling scheme:**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  

Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  

The recycling scheme must be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

**9.4 Material Requirements & Corrosion**  
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production JSC (“VinFast”).  

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro environmental factors.
Page 70
The requirements of corrosion classification and tests are listed below:

**Corrosivity classifications:**
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used for positions unaffected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road deicing salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Applied when the position is moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road deicing salts.
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default for exterior positions directly exposed to road spray.
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for positions directly exposed to road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered a high corrosivity area.

**Material and design considerations:**
- Material combinations must prevent galvanic corrosion. Protective coatings (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers) should be added for critical material combinations.
- Avoid water/dirt accumulation by providing drainage at lowest points and preventing dirt traps that erode painted surfaces through micro movements.
- Contact surfaces must be dry, non-abrasive, and minimize micro-movement.
- Burr-free edges and good paint coverage must be ensured.

---

**Corrosion tests:**
System/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests are mandatory.

**Component tests for metallic surfaces:**
- **Salt Spray Test:** ISO9227, acceptance criteria specified below.

**Tests for organic coatings:**
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria specified below.

Alternative tests may be proposed by the supplier but must be approved by a corrosion engineer.

Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:  
- Rust creep according ISO4628-8: galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm; Steel (non galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.  
- Blistering: Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  
- Edge corrosion: ≤ 10%.  
- Weld seam corrosion: ≤ 5%.  
- Degree of rusting: ≤ Ri 1 (according ISO4628-3).  

##### Stainless Steel:  
Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion); in most cases, an insulating coating is needed.  
- Test criteria for high visible parts: 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check especially areas with crevices.  
- Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.  

##### Aluminium Parts:  
- Aluminium parts in high visible areas have to be painted or anodized.  
- Test criteria Painted Aluminium: Refer to criteria for organic coatings.  
- Test criteria Anodized Aluminium: 480h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.  
- Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.  

##### Chromed Metal Parts:  
- 240h NSS ISO9227 without base material corrosion.  

##### Chromed Plastic Parts:  
- CASS-Test According DIN EN ISO 9227; duration:  
  - 48h for Exterior.  
  - 24h for Interior.  
- Acceptance criteria: no surface defects.  
- Also: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.  

##### Electric Parts:  
Requirements and tests for electrical parts must be applied consistently with corrosion standards, ensuring functionality and durability in all conditions outlined above.
Page 72
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations. 

Material combinations shall be chosen to prevent galvanic corrosion. This requirement includes fasteners and attached brackets. Avoid direct contact with more noble metals such as steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Utilize surface treatments on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials.  

Electrical components must be installed such that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  

**Terminals, Connectors:** Do not place terminals on the lowest points. Tightness of terminals is required to prevent corrosion. Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.

**Groundings:** Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.

**Aluminium/Sealing Surfaces:** Aluminium alloys containing copper and iron content > 1% should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces due to their sensitivity to corrosion. Corrosion may penetrate the seal quickly, allowing moisture to enter.  

---

### Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:

- **Shielding:** Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable areas.

- **Design Features:** Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can prevent severe issues.

- **Materials and Coating:** In areas of high stone impact risk, choose materials and paints with matching colours to prevent visible abrasion marks.

- **Edge Design:** Avoid parts with edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.

- **Lower Styling Elements:** For chromed styling elements located on the lower areas of the vehicle, design them to be recessed or deepened to avoid stone impacts.
