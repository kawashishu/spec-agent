3.9.3 Emissions & Toxicology:  
Not applicable.  

3.9.4 Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:  
Not applicable.  

3.9.5 Recycling:  

**Recycled Materials**  
When selecting materials, attention should be focused on reducing the variety of materials and ensuring compatibility with available recycling procedures, referred to as ‘proven recycling technologies.’  
Secondary raw materials such as post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred based on availability in the market. Recycled materials must follow parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert team at VinFast.  

**Recycling Scheme**  
This section establishes general project-wide requirements regarding the recycling and repair scheme during component development.  
Design for recycling of parts and components is mandatory to enable cost-effective recycling at the end of the product’s life.  

The recycling scheme provided by the contractor must outline a simple layout for the potential recycling process of the component. This includes information about preferred recycling partners, cost estimations, and other metrics.  
The recycling scheme must be submitted to the environmental expert team at VinFast before milestone PTO (Production Try-Out).  

3.9.6 Evaporative Emissions:  
Not applicable.  

3.9.7 Drainage and Depollution:  
Complete drainage of fluids is mandatory for safe and environmentally friendly end-of-life vehicle treatment. The complete removal of fluid niches and pockets must be avoided to ensure effective drainage processes.  

The drainage scheme provided must include a virtual or physical test protocol detailing the type of drained fluids, the amount of drained fluids (expressed in weight-%), and the absolute mass of drained fluids (in kilograms). This information must be shared with the environmental expert team at VinFast before milestone PTO (Production Try-Out).

3.10 Material Requirements & Corrosion.  
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).  

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  

1. **Corrosivity Low**:  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium**:  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High corrosivity**:  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very high corrosivity**:  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.  

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  

- Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in lowest positions.  
- Avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micromovements.  
- Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.  
- Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.  

### 3.10.1 Corrosion tests.  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

- **Component test for metallic surfaces**: Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.  
- **For organic coatings**: Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.  

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by a corrosion engineer.  

**Test criteria:**  

| Area          | Corrosivity          | Metallic Coatings | Organic Coatings | Pass Criteria |

- 48h for Exterior  
- 24h for Interior  
Acceptance Criteria: No surface defects.  
Also: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.

Electric Parts:  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations.  

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.  
- Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness.  
- Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion resistant and compatible with other materials.  
- The electrical components must be installed so vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  

Terminals and Connectors:  
- Do not place terminals on the lowest points.  
- Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily required for tightness: electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  

Groundings:  
- Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.  

Aluminium and Sealing Surfaces:  
- Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content above 1% are sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate seals quickly, allowing moisture to enter.

Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues:  
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized through design measures:  
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable components.  
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help prevent severe issues.  
- In areas with high stone-hitting risk, choose parts and paint materials with the same color to avoid visible abrasion marks.  
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.

7 Supplier Responsibilities.

Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer Service Requirements.**  
After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup. The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall not be shorter than 10 years after VinFast starts production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VinFast after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).

8 Intellectual Property / Copyright.  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).

9 Insurance / Warranties.  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).

10 VinFast GTC & Part Packaging and Incoterms.  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition, part packaging requirements, and Incoterms requirement in the RFQ package.

11 Appearance Approval Process.

The Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is applicable by suppliers to supply components affecting CMF appearance that require VinFast approval prior to PPAP deliverables. This report verifies that the VinFast Design Quality has inspected the final product and it meets all the required appearance specifications for the design. Harmony review is significantly important to ensure the components' quality or state of being homogeneous with adjacent parts.

Design Quality required all suppliers to submit non-commercial value sample parts. Suppliers are required to submit complete assembly parts known as purchase parts (P-level) and child parts known as component parts (D-level). The quantity of parts to be submitted is as follows. Refer to VFDST00038401 for details.
