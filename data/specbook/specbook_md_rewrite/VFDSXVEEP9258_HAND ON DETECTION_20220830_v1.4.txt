2.1 Development Scope Abstract.

This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the STEERING_WHEEL_HAND_ON_DETECTION (HOD). The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics. The Contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements. Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details must be reported immediately. The contractor is a “System Development Supplier,” with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

2.2 Initial Situation and Objective.

IEE HOD is a capacitive system that assesses whether a driver is touching the steering wheel:
- IEE HOD system consists of:
  - Dedicated ECU, small enough to integrate into the steering wheel.
  - Sensor mat with a sensing (Sense) and shielding (Guard) electrode.

2.3 Classification of the System / Component.

LIN component (intelligent), which is necessary in every trim, includes only one variant for the Vietnamese market and one variant for the US market.

2.4 Execution Regulations.

All safety regulations are handled via the corresponding main ECU, like master control by the ADAS ECU.

The supplier must ensure that the developed parts meet the requirements of the laws and the specified requirements of VinFast, obtain the type certification of the parts, and submit all necessary documents to support the type certification of the whole vehicle. When synchronous development is completed, suppliers need to provide the necessary documentation to prove that their products have met the required regulatory requirements.

6.12 Resistance to Media and Chemical Requirements.

6.12.1 Contamination.  
6.12.2 Cleaning.  
6.12.3 Corrosion Protection.

Determination and classification of the corrosivity position need to be performed for each component within the system.
Page 33
6.12 Resistance to Media and Chemical Requirements

1. Corrosivity Low: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. Corrosivity Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. High corrosivity: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. Very high corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. 

Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners, etc. that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion. 
Terminals and Connectors: Terminals must not be placed at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness to prevent humidity penetration.
Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.
Aluminium/Sealing Surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of >1% are highly sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided in components with sealing surfaces, as corrosion may penetrate the seals quickly, allowing moisture entry.

### Corrosion Tests
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as complete vehicle corrosion tests. Before and after corrosion testing, functional tests must be conducted.

**Component test for metallic surfaces:**  
- Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria specified below.  

**Tests for organic coatings:**  
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria specified below.

At least all materials and substances used for automotive products must meet the Global Automotive Declarable Substances List (GADSL).  

Further information:  
https://www.gadsl.org/  

Recycled Materials  
When selecting materials, attention must be focused on reducing the variety of materials and compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  
Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) must be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials must be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and reported to the environmental compliance expert team at VinFast.  

6.13.2 End of Life Treatment  
**Dismantling Scheme**  
The dismantling scheme describes the requirements to the contractor in terms of a simple, unmixed dismantling of the component as well as its accessibility when assembled.  
A dismantling scheme must be provided to the environmental expert team at the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

**Recycling Scheme**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme for the development of a component.  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor must show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling scheme must be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

**Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization**  
To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:  
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks/check of deployment per component).  
- After deployment of the pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that shall be classified, according to the status of the respectively valid waste legislation, as toxic waste or hazardous substances (otherwise the components shall be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances).  
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle/via feedback at the deployment tool).  
- Marking of positions of pyrotechnical components (especially “hidden” components, e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest).  
- In case of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is required. In this case, pre-dismantling, if technically possible, shall be avoided (accessibility of fasteners).
Page 36
6.13.3 Eco-Design  
Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations, which have been defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<).

6.13.4 Lifecycle Analysis  

6.13.5 Emissions & Toxicology  
Harmful substances in components and materials.  
The emission behavior of the E/E product with direct contact to the interior compartment has to be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment have to be minimized accordingly. Required measurements for confirmation of the emission characteristics have to be carried out by the supplier in agreement with the specialist department of VinFast. 

The measurements have to be done at testing institutes approved by VinFast. It is recommended to obtain an overview of all approved testing institutes from VinFast. Additional requirements can be found in project-specific documents, e.g., Emission Guideline. 

Volatile organic compounds of components have to be checked according to ISO12219. Conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured throughout the complete product life cycle.  
The specialist department of VinFast evaluates the test result. In any case, the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health has to be attested in written form on demand. The supplier has to provide measurement results regarding VOC and Fogging for the materials before the milestone purchase release.  

6.14 Mechanical Requirements  

6.14.1 Load  

Operating loads.  
Operating loads are the loads that occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VF. The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run.  

The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in Chapter 5.18.  

Special events.  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approximately < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  

The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur, and the intended service life will not be reduced.  

Misuse events.  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned so that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easily replaceable parts before body structure). Cracks or damage only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or at neighboring components (principle “deformation before break”).  

6.14.2 Vibration Behavior.  
The eigen frequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 30 Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VF. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in Chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.
Page 37
6.14.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.  

6.14.4 Deformation  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.  

6.14.5 Pressure  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.  

6.14.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance  
S&R, General  
Noises, which are perceived by the customers as disturbing, have to be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps and forming. The supplier has to guarantee that components are free of disturbing noises in their vehicle environment and geometrical integration, even during vehicle- and audio system excitation under all environmental conditions throughout the fixed component service life.  

No squeak and rattle noises due to body excitation (wind load, torsional flexing, etc.) are acceptable if real relative movements exist on the surface. This standard must be guaranteed across all operating and environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity. Evidence of noise freedom must be coordinated with the testing team.  

Suppliers are responsible for supporting the development of vibration and acoustic behavior of subsystems in the complete vehicle environment and ensuring consistent acoustic quality in delivered parts. Active support includes identifying problems and proposing solutions. Necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation must be delivered free of charge as requested.  

6.15 Durability / Life Time  
The lifetime mileage of the complete vehicle shall be at least 160,000 km, and the vehicle lifetime shall be at least 10 years.  

Environmental operating conditions:  
- Ambient temperature: -30°C to +50°C
