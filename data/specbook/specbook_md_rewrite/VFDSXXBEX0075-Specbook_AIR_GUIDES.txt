The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times.  

Tests will be contracted to B2P SUP.  

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.  

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed. The controlling of test progress must also be thoroughly monitored.  

The B2P SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification, and VinFast can attend any testing at the B2P SUP site or their testing centers if requested. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast and B2P SUP.  

If testing was conducted with incorrect parts, missing parts, or an invalid testing procedure, the testing process must be reperformed. Costs associated with repeating the tests will be covered by B2P SUP. In case of negative test results or test failures arising from B2P SUP responsibility, the retesting will also have to be conducted at their expense.  

Following data must be included in DVP&R:  
- Testing declaration covering standard, norms, and legal requirements.  
- Description of the testing set-up, including pictures.  
- Responsible test department.  
- Location of the testing (internal or external environments).  
- Duration and timeline for testing (mapped out as a project plan).  
- Exact part variant and component descriptions.  
- Number of tested components/parts.  

Details must be submitted to VinFast IMDS (ID 214435) to ensure adherence to material guidelines.  

**Testing documents and requirements:**  
Testing and validation records ensure mileage specifications covering at least 160,000 kilometers or a fixed accumulative duration of 10 Year Manufacturing Timelapse (Probabilities for sensory warranty builds will apply whichever milestones triggers Next Evolution, Maintenance Milestones, or limit structuring).

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

The component developer must assure all relevant legislations for only his component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VF-requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VF. All relevant target markets’ law obligations have to be achieved. 

All tests must be documented according to VinFast standards, alternatively to B2P SUP standards, if this is accepted by VF. 

The B2P SUP has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for all development phases according to the specification. The tests have to be brought in the required DVP&R template (as an enclosure to the offer). 

Samples for sample inspections are to be made available in time or no later than the agreed date, coordinated with the test department. 

In order to coordinate the form and the surface, corresponding samples have to be presented by the B2P SUP at the corresponding approval offices at VF with a Cubing report and Appearance Approval report (see VF Standard Color matching / Appearance Approval VFDST00038400). 

Matching parts have to be present from B2P SUP, and timing will be provided by the matching department. Matching parts are to be provided by B2P SUP free of charge (measured and marked according to VinFast Standards). Marking of sample parts must comply with VF Standard VFDST00008700. Preparation of measurement reports must follow VF Standard VFDST00008900. 

Evaluation systems of parts must adhere to VF Standard VFDST00008300 (from sample parts). Reference points systems must follow VF Standard VFDST00000011.

**3.7.3.2 Release by test-departments**

The responsible VF test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the B2P SUP and during the complete vehicle integration tests. 

The B2P SUP must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. If any problems arise (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the B2P SUP must submit a test report, must be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions (to keep all milestones and to observe all targets). 

OK or NOK results need to be stated on the first sheet of the report.

**3.7.3.3 Analyses and test-reports**

The B2P SUP has to provide measurement reports (VFDST00008900) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during the prototype generations. 

After the individual tests, the test samples have to be analyzed in detail. The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report must be handed over to the responsible VF department for release.
