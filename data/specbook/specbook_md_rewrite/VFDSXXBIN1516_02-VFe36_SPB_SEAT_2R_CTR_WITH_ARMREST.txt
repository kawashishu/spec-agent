4.4.2 Interface to vehicle electrical system.

VF36 2R SHVU is located at the Center Seat Cushion for the 7-seater variant.

Furthermore, the Seatbelt Reminder system (SBR) is located within both of the Outboard (OB) Seat cushions. It functions as an element of the airbag control system in detecting the occupancy status of the front seats to assist the Airbag Control Module (ACM) with airbags deployment and suppression logic.

For details on the CAN communication system inputs and outputs to the front seats, refer to the E&E network specification book.

4.5 Product Safety. 

The seating system design is developed following the considerations of IATF 16949 section 4.4.1.2 regarding Product Safety and the related steps using dFMEA, with suitable checks and validation as preventative actions to mitigate each potential failure mode. 

The process was initiated in steps starting with the P-diagram and interface matrix to generate a function tree as the index basis for the dFMEA itself: 

Refer to the FMEAXXBIN1516_01-DFMEA_SEAT_2R_CTR_SEAT_WITH_ARMREST_VF9.

Included in the dFMEA are the following considerations to mitigate potential product safety concerns:
- Cross-check all historical product recall campaign failure causes (NHTSA and Rapex) from the past 10 years, to ensure inclusion in the FMEA’s potential failures and causes. 
- Function group 9 lists every regulatory requirement’s failure-to-comply mode as a line item in the FMEA. 

Failure causes which extend into component sub-suppliers scope have been cascaded through the Special Characteristic Agreement (SCA) document for tracking and auditing through their respective organization per IATF 16949 Product Safety standards, as committed within Vinfast’s Statement of Requirements at nomination and Purchasing Terms & Conditions agreements.

4.6 Functional Safety. 

Functional Safety is managed and audited at the system level by a dedicated team in Vinfast, to ensure compliance with ISO 26262 requirements.

5 FEATURES, PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERISTICS.

5.1 Sub-systems and Functional Attributes.

5.1.1 Frame Structure.

The second-row Center seat structure consists of two main elements: the cushion chassis and the seat back frame.

The two elements are joined via 4X M12 bolts. As an added safety measure, to mitigate risks of bolts loosening during service life, the bolts include a threadlock patch.

The backframe consists of two side members, two cross members, a pair of recliners (power), and a recliner driveshaft.

Materials used for the pressed parts are as per the below chart:
- Side members (x2): Material grade: CR330Y590T- DP (VDA 239-100). Thickness: 1.6mm. Manufacturing source: Vinfast in-house, Vietnam.
- Upper cross member: Material grade: HC420LA (EN 10268). Thickness: 1.0mm. Manufacturing source: Vinfast in-house, Vietnam.

- Recliners & driveshaft: Material grade: Composite. Thickness: N/A. Manufacturing source: Imasen, Japan (via HCMF).

The back frame assembly is welded together onsite at Vinfast, Vietnam. The Vinfast assembly drawing provides full details of weld interfaces.

Process control in the production process is required to ensure the recliners welded onto either side of the frame are positionally synchronised and their fully-locked condition (manual versions) is synchronised before the recliner driveshaft is attached.
Page 22
The Cushion Chassis consists of two Cushion Risers, two Hinge Brackets, a Cushion Pan, Trim attachment wires, a Carrier Bracket assembly, and two Hinge Springs.

Materials used for the components within the cushion chassis are as per the below chart:

5.1.3 Fore/aft adjustment (track slide).  
The power track slides, one inboard assembly and one outboard assembly, consist of an upper and lower slide rails.  

The upper rails have threaded studs attached to them which provide attachment points for the cushion riser brackets to be assembled. On the inboard track slides, the rear bracket incorporates the seatbelt buckle anchorage.  

Through the center of the assembly runs a threaded rod which is attached front and rear to the lower rail. A gearbox is located on the threaded rod to drive the fore/aft movement between the two track rails.  

A set of ball bearings are positioned between the two rails to aid smooth articulation.
