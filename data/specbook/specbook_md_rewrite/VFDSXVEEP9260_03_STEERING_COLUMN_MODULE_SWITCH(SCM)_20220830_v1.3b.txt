Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g., what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English. 

All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.

Shall.
The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.

SCM_MFS_Steering Wheel Heat Logic.

**Block Diagram**  
- MHU to MFS via XGW:
  - ON Steering wheel Heat Function.
  - OFF Steering Wheel Heat Function.

**Steering Wheel Heater ON-OFF Logic**  
VF Logic for STWH ON–OFF through MFS R and MHU. Logic Steps:  
1. ON signal through communication.
2. MFS-R switches on the internal logic and the STWH circuit begins to operate. Heater begins heating.
3. NTC temperature sensor monitors the temperature.
4. When the maximum temperature threshold is reached, the MFS-R brakes the heating process, stopping the function momentarily as the STWH begins cooling down.
5. The temperature sensor monitors the cooling process.
6. Upon reaching the minimum temperature threshold, the MFS-R switches ON the STWH again.
7. The temperature oscillates between the maximum and minimum thresholds during STWH operation.
8. If the Driver switches OFF the STWH function through the Multifunction screen, the MFS-R receives the communication message.
9. MFS-R opens the logic and switches OFF the STWH function, allowing the steering wheel to cool down to ambient temperature.

*Note:* STWH – Steering Wheel Heater.

6.10.3 Handling  

**Ergonomics**  
The complete vehicle must pass the ergonomic tests based on VF internal procedure. All dimensional and material changes that affect ergonomics on parts and modules have to be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.  

The final sign-off of all ergonomic targets will be done in close cooperation with VinFast, which is responsible for interior and exterior styling. VinFast ultimately approves targets by evaluations using the styling bucks.  

6.11 Technical Material Requirements  

**Environmental Compatibility**  
The minimization of environmental impacts of a product through the complete lifecycle is a key factor for future development of innovative products.  

A minimization of environmental impacts of a product requires:  
- Use of recyclable materials.  
- Use of recycled materials and renewable resources.  
- Prevention of hazardous substances.  
- Minimization of compartment emissions including odor.  
- Minimization of consumption of resources.  
- Strategy for waste prevention.

6.12 Resistance to Media and Chemical Requirements.

6.12.1 Contamination.

6.12.2 Cleaning.

6.12.3 Corrosion Protection.

Generally, for determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. Corrosivity Low: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. Corrosivity Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. High Corrosivity: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. Very High Corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.

Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners, etc., that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

Electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion. Terminals and connectors: Don’t place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness: Electrical connections must be protected from humidity. Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of >1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Reason: Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it to moisture entry.

Corrosion Tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as complete vehicle corrosion tests. Before and after corrosion testing, functional testing must be performed.

- Component test for metallic surfaces: Salt spray test: ISO 9227, acceptance criteria specified.
- For organic coatings: Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO 11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria specified.

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by a corrosion engineer.

Events outside intended vehicle use, such as curbstone impact, do not compromise vehicle safety or function.
Page 38
6.14 Mechanical Requirements.

6.14.1 Load.
Operating loads are the loads that occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast. The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in Chapter 5.18.

Special events refer to occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS braking. The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect its function, while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life is not reduced.

Misuse events refer to actions that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impacts. The vehicle must be dimensioned such that:
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).
Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations. Either to the same or at neighboring components (principle: "deformation before break").

6.14.2 Vibration Behavior.
The eigen frequency of the component, when mounted to the vehicle, shall not be less than 30 Hz. The supplier must align the fixation concept with VinFast. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in Chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.

6.14.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics.
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, or Fatigue.

6.14.4 Deformation.
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, or Fatigue.

6.14.5 Pressure.
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, or Fatigue.

6.14.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance.
Squeak and Rattle Behavior (S&R), General.
Noises perceived as disturbing by customers must be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier must ensure that components are free from disturbing noise in their vehicle environment and their geometrical integration. Similarly, this must apply to vehicle and audio system excitation under all environmental conditions and over the fixed component service life. Squeak and rattle noise, caused by excitation of wind load, torsional flexing, etc., must not occur if relative movements on the surface evolve. This requirement must be guaranteed over the full range of operating and environmental conditions (temperature and humidity). 

The supplier is responsible for supporting the development of vibration and acoustic behavior of the subsystem within the complete vehicle environment. They must ensure constant acoustic quality of delivered parts. This responsibility includes actively pointing out problems and proposing solutions. The supplier must also deliver necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation, free of charge.

6.15 Durability / Life Time.
The lifetime mileage of the complete vehicle shall be at least 160,000 km, and the vehicle lifetime shall be a minimum of 10 years. 

The environmental operating conditions are:
- -30°C to +50°C ambient temperature.
- 0 - 100% relative humidity.
- -100 m to 3,500 m above mean sea level.
