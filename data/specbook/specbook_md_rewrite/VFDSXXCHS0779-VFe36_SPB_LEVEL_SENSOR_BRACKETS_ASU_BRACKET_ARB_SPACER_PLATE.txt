6 Supplier responsibilities  
The supplier is responsible for providing and ensuring the completion of work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.  

### Customer service requirements  
#### After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

#### Spare Parts Support Cycle  
The support period of after-sales spare parts must ensure the life cycles of the project and meet requirements in the General Terms and Conditions (GTC) after VinFast ends production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this Spare Parts Book (SPB).  

#### Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VinFast after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This information includes the BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).

11 Production Quality.

11.1 In-Process Testing.  
In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuing improvement. Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan. When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked.
Page 18
The table summarizes the various In-Process (IP) tests and their acceptance parameters, serving as the basis for developing a complete Control Plan. The Control Plan will incorporate frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.

### Table of Tests

1. **Parts Marking according to ISO Standards.** Refer to VFDST00000010 (ISO 1043-1).
2. **Corrosion Test (NSS/Cyclic Corrosion).** Conducted according to ISO 9227, ISO 11997-B, and ISO 6270 CH using methods specified in the specification book based on substrate, coating, corrosivity, application, etc.
3. **Hardness Test.**
4. **Powder Coating Thickness.**
5. **Shaker Test.** This test is only applicable for ASU Brackets and Front and Rear Level Sensor Brackets.
6. **Dimensional Result.**
