#### 3.7.1 Test plan  
Testing is regulated by a test plan that outlines responsibility, timelines, and necessary devices while tracking testing results visually. Quality control must be continuous throughout the testing phase.  

- B2P SUP oversees test procedures, approved by validation engineers and component lead engineers at VF.  
- Weekly updates to the test plan are mandatory, accommodating new data or development changes.  
- VinFast must access full testing protocols/reports and attend testing at B2P SUP sites or testing centers.  
- If incorrect procedures or parts are used, the tests must be repeated at B2P SUP’s expense. Negative results demand replanning and repeat tests funded by B2P SUP if they are responsible for the failures.  

Following data must be included in DVP&R:  
- Standards, norms, and legal requirements, outlined with declarations.  
- Devices setup descriptions, illustrated with photos.  
- Testing department responsibilities detailed clearly.  
- Testing duration and timelines structured.  
- Comprehensive variant and component descriptions.  

#### 3.7.2 Test plan example

   The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times.  
   For tests the B2P SUP is contracted.  
   The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.  
   The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.  
   The B2P SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the B2P SUP site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast/B2P SUP.  
   If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts or different testing procedure, the testing has to be redone at the costs of B2P SUP. In case of negative test results the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting has to be paid by B2P SUP if they are responsible for the failure.  

   Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:  
   - Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.  
   - How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).  
   - Responsible test department.  
   - Where the testing was performed (internal/external).  
   - Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of a project plan).  
   - Part variant, description of part.  
   - No. of tested components/parts.  
   The B2P SUP is responsible to use the draft DVP&R provided by VF testing department.  
   The B2P SUP has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.  
   In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.  
   Upon request, the B2P SUP must use a test plan for each single component.  

3.7.2 Test plan example.  
   DVP has to be weekly updated into following points by the supplier.  

3.7.3 Testing.  
3.7.3.1 General.  
   The B2P SUP provides in time a detailed testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart.  
   It must be guaranteed, that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.  
   In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.  
   The Supplier has to download the VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC.  

   Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.  
   The component developer must assure all relevant legislations for only his component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VF requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled.  
   All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VF.  
   All relevant target markets law obligations have to be achieved.  
   All tests must be documented according to VinFast standard, alternatively to B2P SUP standard, if this is accepted by VF.  
   The B2P SUP has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for all development phases according to the specification.  
   The tests have to be brought in the required DVP&R template (as an enclosure to the offer).  
   Samples for sample inspections to be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (in coordination with the test department).  
   In order to coordinate the form and the surface, corresponding samples have to be presented by the B2P SUP at the corresponding approval offices at VF with Cubing report and Appearance Approval report (see VF Standard Color matching / Appearance Approval VFDST00038400).  
   Matching parts have to be present from B2P SUP (timing will be provided by the matching department).  
   Matching parts to be provided from B2P SUP free of charge (measured and marked according to VinFast Standards).  
   - Marking of sample parts according to VF Standard VFDST00008700.  
   - Preparation of measurement reports according to VF Standard VFDST00008900.  
   - Evaluation system of parts according to VF Standard VFDST00008300 (from sample parts).  
   - Reference points systems according to VF Standard VFDST00000011.  

3.7.3.2 Release by test departments.  
   The responsible VF test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved from the B2P SUP and during the complete vehicles integration tests.  
   - The B2P SUP must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R.  
   - In case of any problems (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the B2P SUP must submit a test report, must be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions (to keep all milestones, to observe all targets).  
   - OK or NOK result needs to be stated on the first sheet of the report.  

3.7.3.3 Analyses, test reports.  
   The B2P SUP has to provide measurement reports (VFDST00008900) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during the prototype generations.  
   After the individual tests, the test samples have to be analyzed in detail.  
   The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report has to be handed over to the responsible VF department for release.

**3.7 Testing and Validation and DVP&R**

Detailed validation and testing procedures include the following steps:

**3.7.4 Test-report/-information**
- Parts must be documented with descriptions, pictures, part numbers, change indexes, materials, production processes, and additives like grease. Deviations from approved serial processes must also be specified.
- Each tested part must carry appropriate labeling.
- Reasons for testing due to negative results must be provided, including earlier test reports.
- Testing details must specify applicable standards, norms, legal requirements, or detailed descriptions of the agreed testing processes.

**3.7.5 Documentation of result**
- Results must be summarized with photos, tables, detailed outcomes, comparisons with earlier reports, OK/NOK evaluations, and visuals of testing setups.
- Comparisons with specification books, testing specifications, and legal requirements must be outlined.
- Recommendations for corrective actions or next steps must be included in the event of negative results.
- Testing progressions must be recorded in a table, identifying task owners, part statuses, and any mismatches between target and due dates. Re-testing due dates and countermeasures must align with VF approval and specify responsible individuals.

The VF test engineer must be alerted within two days of negative test results and updated regularly on testing status and progress. For tests performed for VF, detailed part descriptions must accompany results.

**3.7.6 Archival storage of tested parts**
Parts that undergo testing can only be scrapped if permitted by the VF test department. Testing documentation—including reports, parts, and descriptions—must be retained and presented upon request.

**3.7.7 Virtual testing**
The B2P SUP must create and use detailed calculation models with appropriate methodologies for verifying and optimizing component specifications. Property requirements, especially mechanical properties like rigidity, strength, and dimensional stability, are to be substantiated by FEM calculations.

Tool injection molds must be validated and optimized using simulations. Corresponding operative calculation models must be available upon request.
Page 14
3.7 Virtual Testing. Suitable calculation methods are to be used and adequately detailed calculation models created by the B2P SUP for the purpose of securing, verifying, and effectively optimizing the component properties defined in the technical specification, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations. The requirements related to the mechanical properties of the component in particular such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat and passive safety are to be secured by means of FEM calculations. The tool-dimensioning for the injection molding is to optimize by corresponding simulations. On request, the operative calculation models that represent the respective development status are to be made available at any time to the requesting technical departments of VF for the purpose of internal calculations and integration work. On request from VinFast, the B2P SUP has to provide suitable FEM models without extra cost. The tests from the B2P SUP according to the evaluation plan must be calculative documented (e.g. FEM) before the tool dimensioning.

3.7.8 Component Testing. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed upon by VF, VinFast, and the B2P SUP, and will be binding.

3.7.9 Mechanical Integration Tests. The following tests will be done as mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle:
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100)
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800)
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000)
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600)

Basically, no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range according to VTS are allowed. In particular, by the use of materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients, the behavior has to be kept. The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded. If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast’s test department have to be provided by the B2P SUP free of charge.

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts. AAR is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is described in the VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing). For each step of the process, the Supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval. The process will start in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS. Suppliers have to include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.
