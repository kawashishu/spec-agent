The main requirements are defined in “VFDST00040300 Cyclic Corrosion Testing” and must be fulfilled. No dirt or water retention in the installed condition is allowed, and abrasions to the car body must be avoided.

To verify corrosion protection for the components on the complete vehicle, the components must pass a corrosion durability run. Components with metallic coating in visible areas must pass without red rust according to “VFDST00041200 Salt Spray,” with no system failure due to corrosion expected for 10 years. Painted components in visible areas must pass 10 Cycles VDA (Climatic-Change-Test) 621-415 test.

### 3.5 Traceability
For part requirements, follow the specifications in VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

### 3.6 Labeling of Parts
Suppliers must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010 and include figures showing where labels will be placed on parts (position labels set up with pictures).

### 3.7 Testing and Validation and DVP&R
DVP and PC test responsibilities are guided by RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for System, Sub-system, and Component Level must align with the Complete Vehicle Specification Book during the concept phase.
Page 10
Detailed test plans for hardware tests within the DVP&R files are coordinated with the Testing & Validation department. This includes:
- Declaration of standards, norms, and legal requirements.
- Detailed descriptions of the testing setup, including images of the devices and methods used.
- Specification of whether testing conditions were internal or external.
- Comprehensive timelines and project plans for the tests.
- Details on part variations and part descriptions.
- Documentation of tested components and parts.

The target lifespan aligns with mileage requirements of 160,000 kilometers or 10 years, whichever comes first.

Document reference for DVP for Components: VFDSXXDCL0123.

### 3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts
Appearance Approval (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process follows VFDST00038401 and includes conditions such as the quantity of parts and timing. Suppliers must ensure delivery of parts that comply with agreed timing and requirements to VinFast Quality Design for approvals (OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR).

The approval process begins in early phases (PT build) to ensure AAR is accomplished by Late Stage (LS). Approval activities must be incorporated into supplier development processes and ED&D cost planning.
