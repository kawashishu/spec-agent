Durability / Corrosion  
Corrosion Test (NSS/Cyclic Corrosion) is conducted per certifications ISO 9227, ISO 11997-B, and ISO 6270 CH. This adheres to the specification book guidelines for testing methods, which depend on substrate, coating, corrosivity, and application.

Climatic change test is detailed under VFDST00046100 (Mechanical Integration):  
- Temperature: -30°C to 80°C (95°C).  
- Humid Range: 10% to 95% r.H.  
- Duration: 18 days.  
- Evaluation: No warping, cracking, blister, staining, etc.  

Additional protocols include:  
- VFDST00046100: Climate test for components.  
- VFDST00043900: Chemical Resistance Test of surfaces.  
For further requirements, refer to SOR VFSRXNBEX0006 and DVP DVPRXNBEX0038.

Safety – Security  
Minimum radius edge requirements stand at 3.2 mm.  
2 PIG 0051 (TTCC) establishes toxicology requirements.  

Mirror functionality mandates providing a field of view with an included horizontal angle, measured from the projected eye point, of no less than 20 degrees. Vertical angles must suffice to provide a view of a level road surface extending to the horizon starting at a point no more than 61 m (200 feet) to the rear of the vehicle.  

Further references include FMUSS and ECE regulation.  

Flammability (burning behavior) is noted under VFDST00032600 and covers all used materials:  
- UN-R118.  
- DIN 75200.  
- FMVSS 302.  

For further requirements, refer to SOR VFSRXNBEX0006 and DVP DVPRXNBEX0038.
