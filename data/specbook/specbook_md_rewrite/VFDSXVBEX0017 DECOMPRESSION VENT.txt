**Decompression Vent Positioning:**  
The decompression vent should be positioned in the rear of the vehicle, right below the trunk aperture. Integration factors such as package space, HVAC airflow rate, and door size determine the exact dimensions of this component. The vehicle will have two decompression vents, each fitted with a seal to prevent water intrusion into the vehicle's interior. These seals will be fixed to the frame of the component.

---

**Package and Dimensions:**  
The goal is to utilize an existing decompression vent or carry over parts from other vents, avoiding the development of a new component entirely. The provided dimensions represent the available package space and serve as a guideline for selecting appropriate parts. The configuration may include either two flaps or a single flap. The opening area target for the vent is 250 cm², with the final specification subject to alignment. Suppliers must collaborate with VinFast on the number of flaps.

---

**HVAC Requirements:**  
VinFast will conduct airflow simulations arising from the HVAC and door closings. Suppliers are required to supply the PRV curve (pressure vs airflow) obtained from testing as input for these simulations. If testing data is unavailable, the PRV curve may be extrapolated from experience but must be validated later through tests. The maximum airflow rate from the HVAC system is 500 m³ per hour.
Page 8
Door Closing  
The airflow generated by door closing shall be considered. Exact numbers have to be aligned with VinFast. The dimensions give the approximate size of the opening in the body in white. The component dimensions are to be defined by the supplier in alignment with VinFast.

5.2 General CAE Requirements.  
Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL.

VinFast General FE Modelling and Analysis Requirements.  
Finite Element Modelling Requirements to support VinFast SOR.  

Range of Validity: Project VINFAST.

Offenders will be held liable for the payment of damages. All rights reserved in the event of the grant of a patent, utility model, or design. Nothing in this standard supersedes applicable laws and regulations.

5.3 Material Requirement & Corrosion.  
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system as follows:  
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud, dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers). Avoid water and dirt accumulation, and always provide drainage in the lowest positions.
Page 9
Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro-movements. Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement. Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

### Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass System/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

#### Component test for Metallic surfaces:
- **Salt spray test:** ISO9227, acceptance criteria as listed below.

#### For Organic coatings:
- **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria provided below.

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test criteria:

| Area                          | Corrosivity        | Metallic coatings              | Organic coatings                | Pass criteria     |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 96 h → ISO6270 CH | No red rust |
| Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, wet area | Medium | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust |
| High/not visible for customer | Medium | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust |
| High/visible, very high | High | 720 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B + stonechipping protection where needed | CCT: See below |

### Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:
Rust creep according to ISO4628-8: galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
Page 10
Steel (non galvanized) and aluminum sheet requirements include a maximum rust creep size of d≤1 - 2 mm for galvanized steel. Blistering criteria specify that blister size must not exceed S2 as defined in DIN EN ISO 4628-2. Edge corrosion on components must remain ≤ 10%. Weld seam corrosion is limited to ≤ 5%. The degree of rust must be ≤ Ri 1, in accordance with ISO4628-3.

**Stainless Steel:** Direct contact with other metals should be avoided to prevent galvanic corrosion. An insulating coating is typically required. For high visible parts, the test criteria include 720 h NSS ISO 9227 with no surface change, with particular attention to areas with crevices. Component tests should be conducted with assembled sub-systems installed in their vehicle position.

**Aluminum Parts:** Aluminum components in highly visible areas must be painted or anodized. Painted aluminum follows organic coating test criteria, while anodized aluminum requires 480 h NSS ISO 9227 with no surface change. Tests should simulate the installed state of components.

**Chromed Metal Parts:** These require a 240 h NSS ISO9227 test without material corrosion.

**Chromed Plastic Parts:** For external fixtures, a 48-hour CASS-Test pursuant to DIN EN ISO 9227 is required, while internal fixtures require a 24-hour test. Acceptance criteria exclude surface defects, with additional compliance to 240 h NSS ISO9227 tests for surface integrity.

**Electric Parts:** Electrically functional components enclosed in casings with internal air volumes, like control units, must use a moisture-resistant membrane (e.g., Gortex) for ventilation. Galvanic corrosion prevention strategies apply to fasteners and brackets.

**General Material Requirements:** Focus on avoiding material combinations prone to galvanic corrosion. Proper coatings such as paint, plastic, or insulating spacers should be applied in critical areas. Coatings for high visible areas must resist stone chipping, with necessary drainage design to avoid water and dirt accumulation that can harm the vehicle’s structural integrity.
Page 11
Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners, etc., that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials. 

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion. 

Terminals and connectors: Do not place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness: Electrical connections must be protected from humidity. 

Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be watertight if placed in a corrosive environment. 

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of greater than 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Reason: Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.  

**Prevention of stone chipping issues:**  
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:  
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone-hitting risk, choose part materials and paint with the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicles’ driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: Decreases their depth, so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.

### 5.4 Traceability  
For part requirements follow specifications as stated in VinFast standard VFDST00010502 and VFDST00010501.

### 5.5 Labeling of Parts  
Suppliers must adhere to VinFast standard VFDST00000010. A figure for the position to stick labels on parts (position labels set up with pictures) must be provided.

### 5.6 Vehicle Architecture  
**Vehicle Architecture:**  
The complete vehicle must pass the requirements from the vehicle layout plans. All changes on parts and modules affecting the vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence must be communicated to VinFast immediately for separate evaluation.  

The definition and technical geometric specifications regarding complete vehicle dimensions, both interior and exterior, are based on GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.
Page 12
Styling Technique Convergence.
All changes on parts and modules affecting the exterior and/or interior styling surfaces of the vehicle must be communicated to VinFast immediately for separate evaluation. Suppliers are required to provide part or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops. This input must include tooling demands and assembly sequences and can be delivered as office documents, 3D CAD data, or section drawings.

Vehicle Safety.
In case of safety-relevant parts, suppliers must cooperate with the vehicle safety department. Responsibilities include active integration into vehicle safety functions. The occupant survival area must remain intact, forbidding edges below 3.2 mm during and after impact. Suppliers must provide validated CAE models on demand, using LsDyna, ensuring both numerical and physical stability. FE meshes must conform to part axles/geometry with a density of 8–10 mm. Non-compliant meshes require reworking. Suppliers must plan, perform, and fund validated CAE material card creation, including system and component tests.

Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability).
Suppliers must ensure sufficient operational strength for vehicle-typical operational conditions, operating loads, and special events. Product-typical attributes must be verified, and requirements must be defined for ensuring operational strength of the complete vehicle, subsystems, and components. Technical specifications for systems and components serve as the foundation. Mounting forces must be lower than dismounting forces.

Appendix DVP of this component: (VFDSXVBEX0117).

Appendix for Complete Vehicle:
- VFDSXVCVC1401 CSUV_BEV_Appendix_4_DVP_Design Verification Plan.
- VFDSXVCVC2401 CSUV_ICE_Appendix_4_DVP_Design Verification Plan.

**6.1 Test Plan**  
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of his component lies with the SDS. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The SDS has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast/SDS.

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the costs of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the re-testing has to be paid by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of a project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible to use the draft DVP&R provided by VinFast testing department. The initial data filling has to be done by the SDS and has to be submitted to VinFast (at least 4 weeks after the nomination of the SDS).
Page 16
6.2 Tightness

The complete vehicle has to pass the following tests:
- Wading tests
- Splash tests
- Rain tests with different water flow rates and vehicle in tilted positions
- Wash tests with all possible kinds of washing methods, including high pressure
- Dust driving test
- Wet pollution test (vehicle on wet road behind lead vehicle)
- Icing test (wet vehicle cooled down in chamber to -20°C)

**Basic Requirements for tightness, based on Complete vehicle tightness tests:**
- No function-relevant leakage throughout the vehicle life.
- No water entrance into the cabin, also not by the HVAC system.
- Dust entrance, even with open windows, must not exceed a certain level, as described in the tightness requirements.
- Washability to customer satisfaction.
- Passing water pools with high speed and low speed up to fording depth must not cause damage to the vehicle.
- No impairment of function after complete vehicle tightness tests.
- No dirt or water retention in the obstructed condition is allowed.
- Abrasion to the car body must be avoided.
- No other effects which dissatisfy customer (pollution, dropping water, etc.).

---

6.3 NVH and Driving Comfort

The system must not cause any kind of disturbing sound (relative movement, wind noise, squeak and rattle, temperature, flexural torsion…) during any operation. All possible appropriate measures must be taken to prevent operating noises (e.g., wind noise and whining noise) completely or absorb/deaden them to the greatest extent possible to achieve acceptable noises.

**Additional considerations:**
- Chattering or squeaking effects which may occur when high speed driving of the vehicle, also particularly at certain humidity levels, must be avoided by means of a suitable profile design and by choosing the right surface coating process of an appropriately high-quality material pairing (material matching) that offers adequate durability too.
- Components must be mechanically stable up to the highest possible speed range. No deformation of the component is allowed.
- The component must be stable over its lifetime. No deformation or shrinkage over its lifetime, temperature, moisture, or dirt is allowed.
- Glues must maintain the specified adhesion.
- Avoidance of noise generation at components and joints.
