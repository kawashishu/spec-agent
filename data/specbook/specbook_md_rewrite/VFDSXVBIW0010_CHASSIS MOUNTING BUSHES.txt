  - Significant elements.  
  - Key relationships between them.  
- Shows also the interfaces with external elements (typically other vehicle systems).  
- Functionality required from (or assumed of) other items, i.e., what we require from other parts of the vehicle, environment, etc., and how we assume that other systems rely on our outputs (directly or indirectly).  
- What are the constraints on the usage of the item? Performance, Technical, Environmental, etc.  
- What laws, standards, etc. apply to the item, particularly those likely to produce requirements affecting the development of the control system.  
- Known hazards and failure modes.  

NOTE: The specification of the scope of supply defines the functions, properties, and boundaries of the items or elements requested from the supplier.

4.3 The safety goals or the set of relevant safety requirements.  
Including their assigned ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level), if already available, depending on what the supplier is quoting for.

  - **Safety goal requirement:**  
    - ONLY the case where the requirement may state what not to do.  
    - FTTI: Attribute of the safety goal as well as a safe state.  
    - ASIL: Attribute of the safety goal.
