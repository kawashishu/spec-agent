## 2 General Project Guidelines

### 2.1 Development Scope Abstract
This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the Head up Display (HUD).  
The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics.  
The Contractor ensures that the development of the components respect all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements.  
Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details must be reported immediately.  
The contractor is a ‘System Development Supplier,’ with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.  

### 2.2 Initial Situation and Objective
The Windshield Head up display (WHUD) is a module for displaying essential driver information on the windshield to help drivers look easily and naturally. The HUD connects to the INFO CAN, which is a high-speed CAN connection.  
The system is planned to become platform parts to use in further various vehicle models of VINFAST, for various country-specific packages, and for various combinations of optional equipment.  
The adaptation of system functions to a given vehicle shall be accomplished by modular component population of the necessary modules and coding via the diagnostics interface.  
The design of the HUD shall avoid noise generation like squeak and rattle as well as noise generation due to moving parts. Furthermore, the electronic components shall be designed to work without a fan or external cooling under the required temperature conditions.  

To reach valuable night design, it is mandatory that the background dimming of all scales, displays, and warning lights is homogeneous, and the brightness aligns to each other.  
To achieve a visible and acceptable CR of the VI display content during nighttime and under varying background light brightness conditions of the front road, the HUD shall feature auto-dimming functionality based on input light raw value from RLS.  

### 2.3 Classification of the System / Component
| Market          | Vehicle Variant | HUD                              |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Vietnam, US, EU, Canada | Eco, Plus | Windshield Head-up Display for BEV vehicles |

### 2.4 Execution Regulations
VF7 will be developed for Vietnam/Asian, US/Canada, and EU markets. Consequently, all vehicle variants shall consider regulations and demands of the Vietnam market. Exceptions will be displayed.

## 5.2 Block and Principle Diagram.

### 5.2.1 Elements of Systems.
The Head-Up Display (HUD) is designed to reflect vehicle computer information onto the windshield or a transparent plastic in front of the driver. This offers a safer driving experience, particularly at high speeds and during night driving. Drivers can effectively access crucial information, such as speed, warning signals, and navigation directions, without having to look down at the instrument cluster or secondary display.

A typical HUD contains three primary components:
1. **Picture Generating Unit (PGU)**  
2. **Projector Unit**  
3. **Combiner**  

The projection unit in a typical HUD features an optical collimator setup (e.g., a convex lens or concave mirror with a light source like a Cathode Ray Tube, light-emitting diode, or liquid crystal display). This setup produces collimated light, making the image appear as if viewed at infinity. 

The HUD includes a specialized optical system with two concave mirrors that reflect visible light while transmitting infrared radiation. These mirrors, set at a 45° angle of incidence, reduce heat load from the light source through heat-light separation, addressing proximity challenges in close optical configurations like the HUD.

**Figure 4: Windshield HUD System Parameters**  
**Figure 5: SAE Setup Overview for HUD Measurement**
Page 19
### 5 Functional and Technical Requirements  

**Figure 6: SAE measuring points and eye-boxes.**  
The HUD system considers dimensions like 130mm width and 150mm height for visualization in an eye-box within the driver’s line of sight. 

### Head-Up Display System Description  
The HUD provides the driver with a clear display of driving-related information. Key functionalities include:  
1. **Adjustability:**  
   - The driver can switch the HUD on or off.  
   - Positioning of the virtual image can be adjusted.  
   - Brightness of the image can be manually modified as per preference.  
   - Brightness is also auto-adjusted based on driving conditions, such as sunlight exposure during daytime or night driving.  

2. **CAN Bus Integration:**  
   - The HUD directly receives necessary data and signals from other ECUs using the CAN Bus.  
   - Power sources: CL 30 and secondary wakeup with CL 15 for reserved functionality.  

3. **Compatibility:**  
   - System is adaptable for specific vehicle models and configurations catering to diverse market requirements.  
   - Function adaptations achieved via modular assembly and diagnostics coding.

4. **Noise Mitigation Design:**  
   - Preventing squeaks, rattles, and operational noise generation caused by moving parts.  
   - Electromechanical components designed to operate without fans or external cooling systems under standard temperature conditions.  

### High-Level HUD Diagram in Vehicle  
The high-level structure includes:  
- Connection and integration with MHU systems via CAN Bus.  
- Optimized for energy consumption and seamless performance across various global specifications and configurations.

During the user's normal operation, when the HUD goes to standby mode, the concave mirror should stop at the last user setting position. If the HUD is woken up by Network Management, it shall transition to a standby state.

HUD shall only turn ON if CL15 = ON. If CL15 is OFF (Car is locked by keyfob or enters sleep), the HUD shall turn OFF. If the "Head-Up Display" is switched on by the driver through the MHU, the MHU shall set `MHU_SET_HudScreenOnOFF` to ON, and the HUD shall display and set `HUD_OperationState` to Screen ON. If `MHU_SET_HudScreenOnOFF` is set to OFF, the HUD shall turn off the display and set `HUD_OperationState` to Standby. 

If the HUD encounters a malfunction, a warning message shall be triggered to inform the driver of the malfunction. HUD warning messages shall be registered and defined in the Warning Message Catalog.

  **CAN Name:** HUD_State  
  **Signal Name:** HUD_ActualBrightnes  
  **Values:** n.a  
  **Send Method:** Cyclic  

### General Description
The HUD shall provide output data to indicate the user's set brightness level and the actual brightness level detected, following cyclic communication protocol. The brightness levels range from "No action" to "Level 21", with reserved values from 22–31. HUD_ActualBrightnes reflects measured brightness values.
Page 30
5.3.3.4.4 Functional Description  
The HUD can set the brightness level on the MHU by changing the slide bar position. Users can select from 21 brightness levels.  
- The MHU shall send the signal `MHU_SET_UserBrightnessLvl` to HUD.  
- HUD shall provide feedback via the signal `HUD_UserSetBrightnessLvl`.  

The Rain-Light Sensor (RLS) sends the front road light brightness value using the signal `RS_HUD_illuminance` to HUD (`RLS -> BCM -> XGW -> HUD`). HUD uses this brightness value (`RS_F_HUD_Sensor`) as the VI background brightness or ambient brightness. It controls HUD output brightness in accordance with the calculated CRVI:  

**CRVI Formula:**  
\[CRVI = \frac{VI Luminance + (Background Luminance\_RLS + Ambient Luminance)}{(Background Luminance\_RLS + Ambient Luminance)}\]  

If the Rain-Light Sensor errors (`RS_F_HUD_Sensor == 1`), HUD displays brightness with a suitable value to ensure visibility in both day and night conditions.  

**Day/Night Detection:**  
- HUD determines day/night conditions based on the following signals:  
  - `BCM_LowBeamSts`  
  - `BCM_HighBeamSts`  
  - `LDML_HighBeamSts`, `LDMR_HighBeamSts`, `LDML_LowBeamSts`, `LDMR_LowBeamSts`.  

If any of the following conditions are met:  
- `LDML_HighBeamSts == 1 “ON”`  
- `LDMR_HighBeamSts == 1 “ON”`  
- `LDML_LowBeamSts == 1 “ON”`  
- `LDMR_LowBeamSts == 1 “ON”`,  

It is assumed to be night condition.  

**Profile Settings:**  
The content/layout settings are saved in MHU. When MHU changes the profile, MHU sends the brightness value for the selected profile via signal.

### 5.3.3.5.4 Functional Description
The vehicle enables a function that allows the driver to enter "Position Edit" mode to change the height and rotation of the Virtual Image (VI) using the Multi-Function Switch (MFS) on the steering wheel.  

- The MHU shall send the signal `MHU_SET_HudWorkingMode` to control HUD entry and exit from "Position Edit" mode.  
- HUD shall provide feedback via the signal `HUD_WorkingMode`.  
- In production samples, the HUD shall ignore values of `MHU_SET_HudWorkingMode` equal to:
  - 2: "EOL Mode"  
  - 3: "Engineering mode".
Page 33
When the User presses the 'Edit Position' button on the MHU, the HUD shall exit the normal display mode and enter the 'position adjustment mode.' The user can adjust the Height of the Virtual Image (VI) by Short Pressing the Up and Down Buttons of the Multifunction Switch (MFS) and adjust the Rotation Angle by Short Pressing the Left and Right Buttons of the MFS. A Short Press of the OK button confirms the setting.

If the HUD is in Position Adjustment Mode without any adjustment from the driver for a timeout period of 15 seconds, the HUD shall exit this mode and return to Working Mode. The Timeout parameter (HUD_SettingTimeOut) is codeable via CDS at VinFast EOL.

The settings for height and rotation shall be saved in the MHU user profile. When the driver changes profiles, the MHU shall restore the profile's position by sending signals `MHU_SET_HudRotateLvl` and `MHU_SET_HudHeightLvl`. Please refer to the function "Restore HUD setting by User Profile."

The HUD shall adhere to the latest HUD HMI specifications.
Page 34
### HUD Adjustment Height/Rotation

#### Overview
The diagram illustrates the sequence of actions for adjusting the HUD height and rotation using Multi-Function Switches (MFS). This process starts when the driver activates the position adjustment mode and includes multiple exit options. The sequence involves signals exchanged between the driver, MHU, MFS, and HUD systems.

#### Steps:

1. **Press Edit Position Button (Driver):**
   - The driver presses the "Edit Position" button on MHU.
   - MHU sends the signal `MHU_SET_HudWorkingMode(1 "Position adjustment Mode")` to the HUD.
   - HUD enters "Position adjustment mode" and displays the adjustment mode HMI.

2. **Adjustment of Height/Rotation (Loop):**
   - The driver uses MFS buttons to adjust the height and rotation values:
     - `MFS_UpControl` and `MFS_DownControl` adjust the Height of Virtual Image (VI).
     - `MFS_LeftControl` and `MFS_RightControl` adjust the Rotation Angle of VI.
     - `MFS_Failure` monitors any errors during the process.
   - HUD updates the position accordingly.

3. **Exit Scenarios:**
   - **By Long Press of OK Button (alt):**
     - The driver performs a long press on the OK button.
     - MFS sends the signal `MFS_OK_Control(2 "Long Press")` to confirm changes.
     - HUD exits "Position adjustment mode" and returns to "Working mode."
     - HUD displays the standard working HMI.
   - **By User via MHU:**
     - The driver exits adjustment mode using the MHU.
     - MHU sends the signal `MHU_SET_HudWorkingMode(0 "Working Mode")` to HUD.
     - HUD exits "Position adjustment mode" and displays the working HMI.
   - **By Timeout:**
     - If no input occurs for a timeout period (`Ttimeout = 15s`), HUD automatically exits "Position adjustment mode."
     - The timeout parameter is adjustable (`HUD_SettingTimeOut`) via CDS at VinFast EOL.
     - HUD returns to "Working mode" and displays the standard working HMI.

4. **Save Settings:**
   - The adjusted height and rotation settings are saved in the MHU user profile.
   - When the driver changes profiles, MHU restores the saved values and sends the signals:
     - `MHU_SET_HudRotateLvl`
     - `MHU_SET_HudHeightLvl`
   - HUD applies the updated profile settings.

#### Notes:
- The HUD must adhere to the latest HUD HMI specification for all adjustments.
- System safeguards ensure that HUD ignores incorrect signals related to "EOL Mode" and "Engineering Mode" for production samples.

#### Diagram Interpretation
The diagram visually represents the signal interactions and conditions for initiating, adjusting, and exiting the HUD position adjustment mode. It categorizes exits into three types: by OK button, via MHU, or by timeout. At each exit point, the HUD seamlessly transitions back to "Working mode."

5.3.3.6.4 Functional Description.

The HUD User profile includes all user setting data/parameters that affect all HUD's behaviors, including but not limited to work mode, functions/features, and display content. These settings are related to the user's personal preferences and user experience. 

MHU shall store the following HUD settings in the User profile:
- HUD User brightness.
- HUD Content (e.g., ADAS, Navigation).
- HUD UI Color.
- HUD Height Level.
- HUD Rotation Angle Level.

The figure illustrates the process of restoring HUD settings by applying stored values from the User profile:
- When the driver changes the user profile, MHU loads the selected HUD settings (e.g., HUD Rotate Level, HUD Height Level, HUD Color, HUD Content, HUD User Brightness Level).
- MHU then sends these parameters to the HUD for application.
- HUD ensures these settings reflect the specific preferences stored in the profile.

**5.3.3.11.3 Output Parameters.**  
No output parameters.

**5.3.3.11.4 Functional Description.**  
HUD shall display only incoming call information. Outgoing call information will not be displayed.
Page 45
HUD shall receive signal MHU_TELStatus, MHU_MUTEStatus, and MHU_TEL_source from MHU initially to determine incoming call events, telephone source, and mute/unmute status. 

HUD shall receive call information (phone name/phone number) by multiple messages MHU_HUD_BASE. Each message contains 6 UTF8 bytes as defined by:
- MHU_UTF8Character_Byte1
- MHU_UTF8Character_Byte2
- MHU_UTF8Character_Byte3
- MHU_UTF8Character_Byte4
- MHU_UTF8Character_Byte5
- MHU_UTF8Character_Byte6.

HUD shall check the signal MHU_TotalMessages to determine the total CAN messages that MHU_HUD_BASE will send. Each message will be counted by signal MHU_MessageNumber. 

The caller name/phone number shall be divided by sending "ETX" (End of Text, Unicode value is 0x03). Unused bytes, if present, shall be filled with 0xFF.

**Example Scenarios**:
1. If call information is encoded into 18 bytes UTF8:
   - MHU shall send 18 / 6 = 3 CAN messages MHU_HUD_BASE.
   - No unused bytes will exist.

2. If call information consists of 15 bytes UTF8:
   - MHU shall send ROUNDUP(15 / 6) = 3 CAN messages MHU_HUD_BASE.
   - The remaining 3 unused bytes shall be filled with value 0xFF.

The block diagram below demonstrates the incoming flow chart.

**Figure Description**:
The diagram illustrates incoming call information flow from MHU to HUD. Example encoding is:
- Total Messages: 3
- Message Number: 1–3
- Byte encoding:
  - Message 1: UTF8 bytes that represent "Peter"
  - Message 2: UTF8 bytes that represent "EXT"
  - Message 3: UTF8 bytes that represent "0988820009", with unused bytes filled as 0xFF.

**Failsafe Behavior**:
HUD shall identify conditions of CAN message loss based on:
1. Signal MHU_MessageNumber increases disjointedly, e.g., 1, 3, 4, 5, 8.
2. Total message count MHU_HUD_BASE does not match the signal value of MHU_TotalMessages.

If MHU_HUD_BASE messages are lost, HUD will not display the entire incoming call information correctly. In such cases, HUD shall not display incoming call information.
Page 46
5.3.3.11.5 Failsafe behavior.
If HUD receives enough messages from MHU_HUD_BASE, it shall concatenate multiple UTF-8 bytes into a UTF8 string and display it on the Virtual Image (VI). The display of incoming call information shall follow HMI/UI specification.

HUD shall receive signal MHU_TELStatus, MHU_MUTEStatus and MHU_TEL_source from MHU initially to determine incoming call events, telephone source, and mute/unmute status.

HUD shall receive call information (phone name/phone number) by multiple messages MHU_HUD_BASE, each message containing 6 UTF-8 bytes (MHU_UTF8Character_Byte1 through MHU_UTF8Character_Byte6).

HUD shall check signal MHU_TotalMessages to determine the total CAN messages MHU_HUD_BASE to be received. Each message will be counted by signal MHU_MessageNumber.

The caller name/phone number shall be divided by sending "ETX" (End of text, Unicode value 0x03). Unused bytes will be filled with 0xFF.

For example:
- If call information is encoded into 18 bytes UTF-8, MHU shall send 18/6 = 3 CAN message MHU_HUD_BASE (no unused byte).
- If call information has 15 bytes UTF-8, MHU shall send ROUNDUP(15/6) = 3 CAN message MHU_HUD_BASE to carry 15 bytes, requiring 3 unused bytes filled as 0xFF.

HUD shall identify lost CAN messages based on:
- Signal MHU_MessageNumber not increasing continuously (e.g., 1, 3, 4, 5, 8).
- Total messages MHU_HUD_BASE not equaling signal MHU_TotalMessages.

If MHU_HUD_BASE is lost, HUD cannot correctly display incoming call information and will not display incoming call information.

If HUD receives sufficient MHU_HUD_BASE messages, it concatenates multiple UTF-8 bytes into an UTF-8 string and displays it on the VI. Incoming call display shall follow HMI/UI specifications.

5.3.3.12.3 Output parameters. The HUD shall display Turn-by-Turn (TBT) icon in the Visual Interface.

5.3.3.12.4 Functional Description. The HUD shall display turn-by-turn (TBT) navigation information if navigation is enabled in the MHU setting. The display of navigation information on HUD shall be synchronized with navigation information on the MHU (Head Unit). HUD shall show TBT navigation if MHU_Nav_State ≠ Disable.

Details of navigation information and layout shall adhere to the latest HMI/Styling Specification. HUD shall support various navigation sources such as Native Map (embedded map), Google Map, and Apple Map, indicated by signal MHU_NavSource. 

MHU must read the distance to the next turn value and its unit from the Map Engine, convert it to a string, and send it to the HUD via one or multiple messages MHU_NAV_GuidanceDist.

Each message MHU_NAV_GuidanceDist can carry up to six UTF-8 bytes using signals:
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte1
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte2
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte3
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte4
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte5
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte6

HUD must combine all UTF-8 bytes, convert them into a string, and display the Distance to Next Turn along with its unit on the HUD.
Page 52
The un-used character shall be set as value EXT with unicode value 0x03. If MHU sends `MHU_NavDist_TotalMsg == 0`, HUD shall hide the distance to the next turn.

Figure 12: Sending distance to the next turn and short guidance text.
MHU shall read the short guidance from the map engine and send it to HUD via multiple messages `MHU_HUD_NAV_GuidaceCont`. Each message of `MHU_HUD_NAV_GuidaceCont` can encode six UTF8 bytes. The un-used character shall be encoded by value “EXT” with unicode value 0x03. 

The HUD shall read multiple messages from `MHU_HUD_NAV_GuidaceCont` and recover the combined string, then display it on HUD. HUD shall display the distance and short guidance text below the TBT icon following the HMI/UI specification. 

If `MHU_HUD_NAV_GuidaceCont::MHU_NavGuidance_TotalMsg == 0`, HUD shall hide the short guidance text.

Below is an example of sending short guidance:

- Sending distance to the next turn and short guidance text: the HUD shall follow the same rule as in the function “Display incoming call information” to receive text from the MHU.
Page 53
HUD shall receive signal MHU_Nav_Distance, then divide by 10 and display the value of distance to the next turn.

HUD shall display the distance-to-next-turn value with multiple mileage units as indicated by signal MHU_Nav_DistanceToNextTurnUnits. HUD shall determine the system mileage unit using the signal MHU_STAT_MileageUnit.

If the navigation unit differs from the system unit, HUD shall convert the distance to the next turn into the system unit:
- Km to Mile and vice versa.
- Meter to Feet/Yard and vice versa.

HUD shall use the following conversion table for distance-to-next-turn conversions based on the current mileage unit determined by the signal MHU_STAT_MileageUnit:

| No | Unit    | Convert Unit      |
|----|---------|------------------|
| 1  | feet    | 0.3048 m         |
| 2  | yard    | 0.9144 m         |
| 3  | m       | 3.2808 feet      |
| 4  | m       | 1.0936 yards     |
| 5  | mile    | 1.609344 km      |
| 6  | km      | 0.621371 mile    |

Based on navigation unit and current system unit, HUD shall convert Km <-> Mile and M <-> Feet.

HUD shall display mileage values with the following resolutions:

| Id | Unit     | Resolution |
|----|----------|------------|
| 1  | km       | 0.1 km     |
| 2  | miles    | 0.1 miles  |
| 3  | m        | 1 m        |
| 4  | yards    | 1 yard     |
| 5  | feet     | 1 foot     |

HUD shall support displaying Turn-by-Turn (TBT) icons from multiple navigation engines in the Head Unit identified by signal MHU_NavSource.

If MHU_NavSource == 0x0 ("Here Map (Default embedded map)") OR MHU_NavSource == 0x3 ("Google Map") OR MHU_NavSource == 0x2 ("Apple Map"), HUD shall display Turn-by-Turn icons mapped by corresponding values of the signal MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon provided in the table below:

| MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon (Dec) | Name         | Icons      |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------|
| 0                        | No Display   | No display |
Page 54
HUD shall display mileage value by following the resolution chart:

| Id | Unit     | Resolution |
|----|----------|------------|
| 1  | km       | 0.1 km     |
| 2  | miles    | 0.1 miles  |
| 3  | m        | 1 m        |
| 4  | yards    | 1 yard     |
| 5  | feets    | 1 feet     |

If `MHU_NavSource == 0x0` (“Here Map - Default embedded map”), `MHU_NavSource == 0x3` (“Google Map”), or `MHU_NavSource == 0x2` (“Apple Map”), HUD shall display the Turn-By-Turn (TBT) icon mapped to the value of signal `MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon (Dec)` in the icons table:

HUD shall support two kinds of roundabouts: roundabout without a specific exit number and roundabout with a specific exit number. If HUD receives signal MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon == 64 (Dec), HUD shall display roundabout without exit number.
Page 62
If HUD receives signal MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon == 65 (Dec) to 83 (Dec), HUD displays the Roundabout with an exit number in the center of the roundabout icon. For example, if MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon == 76 (Dec), HUD will generate a roundabout with the exit at the 12th street as shown.

HUD shall receive one to three messages NAV_JUNC_INFO, and the graphic of dynamic single intersections (Apple map) and dynamic roundabout shall be generated dynamically with junction information. 
If HUD does not receive the NAV_JUNC_INFO message, HUD shall display only the Turn-by-Turn icon without junction information.

On receiving the first NAV_JUNC_INFO message (MHU_Junction_MsgNum == 1), signal MHU_JunctionElement0 implies the exit junction.

If there are multiple junctions, MHU sends multiple NAV_JUNC_INFO messages as shown in the diagram below. Each message NAV_JUNC_INFO supports encoding a maximum of seven junctions. The system shall support up to 19 junctions.

**Figure 13: Junction Information Protocol**
This figure describes how the navigation information is coordinated between the MHU and the HUD as follows:
- MHU: Sends messages to the HUD.
- MHU_HUD_NAV_DISP: Navigation display signal indicating Turn-by-Turn information and extended graphic elements.
- NAV_JUNC_INFO: Series of messages encoding junction details dynamically.

There are 19 types of junctions (junction #1 to junction #19), corresponding to 19 angles. The junctions are represented on a specific coordination system displayed graphically.

5.3.3.13.4 Functional Description

Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) supports automatic adjustment of vehicle speed to maintain safe distancing from other vehicles. Activation occurs upon pressing the ACC button on the steering wheel, and deactivation occurs by pressing the brake pedal or cancel button.

The HUD shall:
- Receive operations from other ADAS ECU systems.
- Visualize Adaptive Cruise Control features based on HMI specifications.

HUD shall display:
- ACC icon.
- Target speed.
- Gap step.
- Lead Object.
- Alert text.

**Conditions for Displaying ACC Information:**
- If ADAS_ACC_State equals "OFF State" (0), "Fault" (7), or if ADAS_ACC_check is not "Available" (0), no ACC information is displayed.
- In the "Standby state" (1), the gap value from ADAS_ACC_TimeGapSet is displayed in grey, while the lead object is omitted.

**Icon Definitions for ACC State Display:**

| Icon Display | ADAS_ACC_ICON_Feed | Definition                                                   |

5.3.3.14.4 Functional Description  
Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) is a driver assistance system that displays the current speed limit and other traffic signs on the road, enabling drivers to infer speed limits. Speed limits may also be inferred from ISA Maps, and warnings will be issued if the driver exceeds these speed limits. The system can also display non-speed-related relevant traffic signs to the user.  

If TSR is ON (`ADAS_TSR_State == 1 "ON"`), HUD shall receive the TSR signals and display the recognized traffic sign indicators accordingly.  

If `ADAS_TSR_State == 0 "Off"`, HUD shall hide the traffic sign display in HUD VI.  

If `ADAS_TSR_Mode_Feed == 2` or `3`, HUD shall ignore the signal and keep the latest state.  

HUD shall display only the speed limit traffic sign (Type 1: general maximum speed limit sign).  

HUD shall display the Traffic Sign Icon contained within the HMI/UI specification and traffic signals corresponding to the target market.  

HUD shall receive the signal `ADAS_TSR_Typ1` and signal `ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value` from ADAS ECU to display the Type 1 icon based on the definitions below:  

| ICON display                 | Speed value             | `ADAS_TSR_Typ1`         | ICON definition                                                             |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No display                   | `0 "No detected"`       | TSR doesn't detect the availability of a speed limit sign.                  |
| ![Speed Limit 20](image)     | `ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value 1` | TSR detects the availability of a speed limit sign: 1: VN, EU. 2: US. 3: Canada. |
| ![End Limit](image)          | `ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value 2` | TSR detects the availability of an end-of-speed-limit sign: 1: VN, EU. 2: US. |

In PTO SW (`CAN DBC v10.4`), HUD shall display the limited speed value as `ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value – 5 (unit)`.  

In PTO SW, HUD shall display the limited speed value as `ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value`.

5.3.3.14.4 Functional Description.  
Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) is a driver assistance system that displays to drivers the current speed limit and other traffic signs on the road, which make it possible to infer speed limits. Speed limits will also be inferred from ISA Maps. The system issues a warning when the driver crosses these speed limits. Additionally, it may detect and display non-speed-related relevant traffic signs to the user.  

- If TSR is ON (ADAS_TSR_State == 1 "ON"), HUD shall receive the TSR signals and display the recognized traffic sign indicator accordingly.  
- If ADAS_TSR_State == 0 "Off", HUD shall hide Traffic sign in HUD VI.  
- If ADAS_TSR_Mode_Feed == 2 or 3, HUD shall ignore and keep the latest state.  

The HUD shall support and display only speed limit traffic signs (Type 1: General maximum speed limit sign).  
HUD shall display the Traffic sign icon defined in the HMI/UI specification.  
HUD shall display Traffic signal corresponding to the target market.  

HUD shall receive the signals ADAS_TSR_Typ1 and ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value from ADAS ECU to display the Type 1 ICON according to the below definitions:  

### ICON display definitions.  
**No display**:  

- Speed value: ADAS_TSR_Typ1.  
- ICON definition: 0 "No detected"  
  TSR does not detect the availability of a Speed limit sign.  

**Speed limit detected**:  

- Speed value: ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value.  
- ICON definition: 1 "Speed limit"  
  TSR detects the availability of a Speed limit sign.  
  - 1: VN, EU.  
  - 2: US.  
  - 3: Canada.  

**End of speed limit detected**:  

- Speed value: ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value.  
- ICON definition: 2 "End of the speed limit"  
  TSR detects the availability of the end of Speed limit sign.  
  - 1: VN, EU.  
  - 2: US.  

### Speed display settings.  
- In PTO SW (CAN DBC v10.4), HUD shall display the limited speed value as ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value - 5 (unit).

5.3.3.20.4 Functional Description  
Advanced Automatic Emergency Brake (AAEB or Front AEB) and Rear Automatic Emergency Brake (RAEB) are two ADAS functions designed to either avoid or lessen the severity of accidents when a collision is imminent with objects (motorized vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists) at the front (with AAEB) or at the back (with RAEB) potentially intervening with the ego-vehicle’s driving path.  
This feature intervenes with the dynamic driving task by applying braking.
Page 90
5.3.3.20.4 Functional Description  
Advanced Automatic Emergency Brake (AAEB or Front AEB) and Rear Automatic Emergency Brake (RAEB) are two ADAS functions designed to mitigate or reduce accidents' severity. AAEB operates for objects such as motor vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists at the front of the ego-vehicle's driving path, while RAEB functions for those at the back. The system dynamically engages braking to stop the vehicle or reduce speed based on the ego-vehicle's speed.  

AAEB (Front AEB) is turned on by default at each ignition cycle.  
HUD shall determine the state of the Front AEB using the ADAS_AEB_State signal.  
HUD shall determine the operational status of Front AEB using the ADAS_AEB_check signal.  

- If AAEB is not available (ADAS_AEB_check != 0), HUD shall not show AAEB warnings.  
- If AAEB is available, HUD shall display AAEB warnings based on the ADAS_AEB_warning signal.  

During regular operation, HUD displays popups and chimes based on ADAS warning signal requests, as defined below:  
- **No Display**: When ADAS_AEB_warning = 0 ("No warning"). Definition: No warning.  
- **Front AEB Braking pop-up**: When ADAS_AEB_warning = 1 ("Braking").  
- **Front AEB Post Braking feedback**: When ADAS_AEB_warning = 2 ("Post Feedback").  

HUD displays AAEB information according to the latest released HMI/UI specification.  

5.3.3.20.5 Failsafe Behavior  
- **Id**: 1  
- **Exception**: If message ADAS_AEB timeouts (3s).  
- **Failsafe Behavior**: HUD shall not display AEB/RAEB information.

#### 5.3.3.22.3 Output Parameters:
Display Forward Collision Warning on the VI.

#### 5.3.3.22.4 Functional Description:
Intersection Assist (IA) is a driver assistance system that warns the driver with visual and audible warnings when it is unsafe to enter an intersection due to a high collision probability with other vehicles or Vulnerable Road Users at an intersection. It also provides warnings when it is unsafe to attempt left/right turns due to high collision risks with traffic participants approaching the same lane without any intention to stop. 

ADAS ECU shall publish IA state on the ADAS_IA_State signal.
Page 94
When Intersection Assist is activated (ADAS_IA_State == 2 "Active State") and detects a high collision probability with other vehicles or Vulnerable Road Users at an intersection, ADAS ECU will trigger a warning using the signals ADAS_IA_Left_warning and ADAS_IA_Right_warning. MHU shall display the Intersection Assist indicator in the car buddy area following the latest HMI/UI specification.

If ADAS_IA_Mode_Feed == 0 "Off," HUD shall not display Intersection Assist warnings on the VI.  
If ADAS_FCW_state != 2 "Active state," HUD shall not display Forward Collision Warning (FCW) on the VI.  
If ADAS_IA_check == 1 "Not Available," HUD shall not display FCW warnings on the VI.  

HUD shall display three levels of IA warnings and corresponding warning chimes according to the definitions below:

#### IA Warning Display Conditions:
1. **No IA Left warning**  
   *Signal Coding:* ADAS_IA_Left_warning = 0  
   *Display:* Hide Left Intersection indicator  

2. **IA Left Warning Stage 1**  
   *Signal Coding:* ADAS_IA_Left_warning = 1  
   *Display:* Left indicator remains active as long as IA is active.  

3. **IA Left Warning Stage 2**  
   *Signal Coding:* ADAS_IA_Left_warning = 2  
   *Display:* Left indicator remains active as long as IA Stage 2 is active.  

4. **IA Left Warning Stage 3**  
   *Signal Coding:* ADAS_IA_Left_warning = 3  
   *Display:* Left indicator remains active as long as IA Stage 3 is active.  

5. **No IA Right warning**  
   *Signal Coding:* ADAS_IA_Right_warning = 0  
   *Display:* Hide Right Intersection indicator.  

HUD shall implement the latest released HMI/UI specification for all Intersection Assist indicators and warnings.

5.15.3 Corrosion Protection.  
Generally:  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system.
Page 110
5.15.3 Corrosion Protection.  
 
**Corrosivity Levels:**  
- Corrosivity Low: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
- Corrosivity Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
- High Corrosivity: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
- Very High Corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

**General Guidelines:**  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as control units, must be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (e.g., type Gortex) when in wet locations.  
Material combinations must be chosen to prevent galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and attached brackets.  
Direct contact with more noble metals such as steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in wet environments should be avoided. Surface treatments for steel fasteners must ensure long-term corrosion resistance and full material compatibility.  

**Additional Requirements:**  
Electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  
Terminals and connectors must not be placed in lowest-point positions to prevent exposure to humidity and corrosion.  
Grounding connections must be water-tight if placed in corrosive environments.  
For aluminum sealing surfaces, alloys with copper and iron content exceeding 1% should be avoided due to their susceptibility to corrosion, which may compromise seals.  

**Corrosion Testing:**  
Parts must pass both system/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests. Functional testing before and after corrosion testing is mandatory.  
- Metallic surfaces: Salt spray test (ISO 9227).  
- Organic coatings: Cyclic corrosion test (CCT) according to ISO 11997 Cycle B.  

**Alternative Testing:**  
Suppliers may propose alternative tests, subject to approval by the corrosion engineer.  

**Test Criteria:**  
| Area                     | Corrosivity   | Metallic coatings      | Organic coatings      | Pass criteria            |  
|--------------------------|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|  
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low           | 240 h NSS à ISO 9227 | 96 h à ISO 6270 CH    | No red rust              |

At least all materials and substances used for automotive products must meet the Global Automotive Declarable Substances List (GADSL).

Further information:
https://www.gadsl.org/

Recycled materials.
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called "proven recycling technologies"). Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred concerning availability on the market. Recycled materials must be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance experts team at VinFast.

5.16.2 End of Life Treatment.

Dismantling Scheme.
The dismantling scheme describes the requirements to the contractor in terms of a simple, unmixed dismantling of the component as well as its accessibility when assembled. The dismantling scheme must be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

Recycling Scheme.
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor must show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. The recycling scheme must be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization.
To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided for, via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks/check of deployment per component).
- After the deployment of the pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that shall be classified, according to the status of the respectively valid waste legislation.
Page 116
5.16 Environmental Compatibility.

5.16.3 Eco-Design.
Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are placed into arrowed brackets, using mathematical signs for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<).

5.16.4 Lifecycle Analysis.
Follow IMDS System.

5.16.5 Emissions & Toxicology.
**Harmful substances in components and materials:**  
The emission behavior of the E/E product, with direct contact to the interior compartment, must be checked using representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the passenger compartment must be minimized. Measurements confirming emission characteristics must be completed by the supplier, in agreement with the specialist department of VinFast, and conducted by approved testing institutes. Suppliers are recommended to obtain an overview of approved testing institutes from VinFast. Additional requirements may be provided in project-specific documents, such as the Emission Guideline.  

Volatile organic compounds must be checked according to ISO12219. The conformance to prohibited substances must be ensured throughout the complete product life cycle. The harmlessness of volatile compounds for human health must be verified with written attestation upon demand. Results of VOC and Fogging tests must be provided prior to the milestone purchase release.

5.17 Mechanical Requirements.

5.17.1 Load.  
**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads refer to conditions arising from intended vehicle use. Measurements of these loads are to be determined using selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast.

The definition of customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for long-distance durability tests. Tested mileage is derived from the desired customer mileage specified in Chapter 5.18.
Page 117
### Special Events  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS braking. The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.

### Misuse Events  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned such that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is maintained after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).  
Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or neighboring components (principle “deformation before break”).

### 5.17.2 Vibration Behavior  
#### NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior  
The maximum vibration level is to be defined by the supplier (brackets must be developed to avoid resonances below a certain frequency).  
Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VF. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.

### 5.17.3 NVH / Acoustic Performance  
Noises perceived by the customers as disturbing must be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming.  
The supplier must guarantee that their components are free of disturbing noise in their vehicle environment and geometrical integration. Similarly, at vehicle- and audio-system excitation, under all environmental conditions, and throughout the fixed component service life. There must not be squeak or rattle noise due to excitation of the body (wind load, torsional flexing, etc.) if such movements evolve on the surface. This must be guaranteed across the entire operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).  
To evidence disturbing noise freedom, requirements must be coordinated with the responsible testing team.  
The supplier is responsible for supporting the development of vibration and acoustic behavior of the subsystem within the complete vehicle environment and must ensure constant acoustic quality of delivered parts. This involves active support in identifying problems and proposing solutions proactively. Additionally, the supplier must deliver necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation, as requested, free of charge.

### 5.18 Durability / Lifetime  
The lifetime mileage of the complete vehicle shall be at least 160,000 km. The vehicle lifetime shall be at least 10 years.  

#### Environmental Operating Conditions
