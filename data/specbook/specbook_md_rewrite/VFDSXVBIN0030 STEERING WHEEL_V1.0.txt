9 Supplier responsibilities.
Suppliers are responsible for providing/ensuring while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract. 

**Customer service requirements:**
- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup:**  
  The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

- **Spare Parts Support Cycle:**  
  The support period for after-sales spare parts shall not be shorter than 10 years after VinFast starts production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts:**  
  The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VinFast's after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.)

Appendix 2: Steering Wheel Design and Mounting Location Details

The steering wheel geometry is designed based on input from the styling team. Its mounting location and dimensions are subject to final adjustment. It is noted that the design may reduce dimensions by up to 15 mm as per the TBC (To Be Confirmed) section.

Visual representation:
A three-dimensional CAD model from the styling team illustrates the steering wheel geometry, showing details of its position and alignment with vehicle geometry.
