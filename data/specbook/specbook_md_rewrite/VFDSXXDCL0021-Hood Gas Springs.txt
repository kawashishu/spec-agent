3.2 Technical Requirement.

3.2.1 Project Requirements.

3.2.1.1 Quality Requirements.
Quality strategies for VinFast vehicles and all associated components aim for zero defects upon delivery and throughout the average product lifetime. This includes avoiding complaints during the product's usage. To achieve this, the development and manufacturing processes must:

- Optimize processes to prevent defects and ensure reliability.
- Observe fundamental quality assurance requirements for objects of development.
  
Series supply processes should adhere to customer requirements regarding purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistic specifications. Risk mitigation tools and methods must be included as per the Activity Interface Agreement.

Components and systems development must ensure compatibility with adjacent systems and adhere to the following standards:

- Maintain full functionality for at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.
- Be designed for high-volume production.
- Require no maintenance throughout the vehicle's lifetime.
- Avoid emitting disturbing noises.
- Remain fully functional for 15,000 hood open-close cycles.
- Utilize standard and common parts whenever feasible.

**3 Requirements**

**3.2 Technical requirement**  
**3.2.1.2 Certification**  
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing. Component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.  
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. The supplier must complete all component/subsystem tests.  
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.  
- In any event, the supplier is obligated to complete all specified test requirements.  
- The component/subsystem supplier must provide VINFAST's product release engineer with a complete component/subsystem test certification plan approved by the engineer. The plan shall include at least the number of samples, test sequence, place, and time of each test.  

**3.2.2 General Description of the System / Component**  
It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.  

Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification have to be agreed upon between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.  

The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve:  

**System-specific requirements**
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of system markets. Moreover, no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments.  
- For technical proposals which exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time-schedule.  
- The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.  

**Passive safety requirements**  
- Passive safety requirements that are implemented must comply with all law requirements of system markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the date of homologation on the Class B and C common platform. VINFAST shall also monitor ongoing changes of rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.  

The supplier delivers the system as a module (all relevant add-on parts are already integrated).  

Add-on parts are:
