Detailed drawings of the components show various views of the CSC housing design, including dimensions and connector layouts. These illustrations provide exact measurements and placements for CSC (3AFE) and CSC (4AFE) housings, allowing for precise integration and compatibility in the battery management system. The following figures illustrate:

1. Dimensional specifications for the CSC modules, including depth, width, and height.
2. Connector placements clearly marked for ease of assembly and signal routing.
3. High-detail component views for identification and alignment during the manufacturing process.

12. Installation instructions.  
BMU and CSC are fixed on the bracket with M5 bolts, and the recommended locking torque is 6Nm. The connectors must not be placed vertically.  
When installing the BMS in pack, all Bus Bar and module connectors (FPC connectors) must be connected, and the cell sampling line should be connected last. Otherwise, there is a risk of board burning. For installing the CSC, the sequence of connectors is as follows:  
- 3 AFEs: J1803 → J1 → J4 → J6.  
- 4 AFEs: J1803 → J1 → J4 → J5 → J6.  

13. Connector information.  
BMU has four connectors:  
- J1800  
- J1801  
- J1802  
- J1803.
