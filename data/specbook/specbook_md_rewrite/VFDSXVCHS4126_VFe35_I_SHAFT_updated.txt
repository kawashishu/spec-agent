4.3.2 Europe

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) regulations.

b. Test report(s) and certificate(s).  
The supplier is responsible for getting their part(s), product(s) or system(s) to meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale.  

VinFast requests the supplier to conduct tests as specified in certain of the UN-ECE at authorized technical service(s). The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  

VinFast also requests that the supplier provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings to be submitted to the relevant authorities in order to get certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any).  

The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations.  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an UN-ECE regulation or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  

The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  

The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

5 Deliverables.

5.1 Technical Deliverables.

Work Interface Chart (RASI). The main supplier obligations are described in the work interface chart (RASI). The status of the supplier (“System Development Supplier”) is defined in System / Component Specification.

RASI is defined as follows:

- **R: Responsible**
  Responsible for proper execution of the activities to fulfill the requirements. She/he is entitled to request the necessary support from other project team members.

- **A: Approval**  
  Obligation to decide/responsible for release. If no decider is defined, the person who is responsible for execution R is the decider.

- **S: Support**  
  Obligated to active support (even if this requires capacity, expenses, and/or transfer of know-how). This project team member must proactively assist the person responsible for execution R in achieving the targets.

- **I: Information**  
  Right to information. This team member is entitled to demand information from R.
