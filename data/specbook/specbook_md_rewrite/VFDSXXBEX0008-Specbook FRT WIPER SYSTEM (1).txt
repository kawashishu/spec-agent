### 3.6 NVH and Driving Comfort
#### Vibrational Comfort / Acoustic Behavior / Isolation Function
The supplier must ensure components are free of noise caused by the wiper motor, wiper levers, or wind excitation during vehicle operation under any driving conditions. 

All components must be of consistent quality to prevent buzzing, squeaks, and rattles.

Elastic decoupling of the wiper motor must be ensured. The supplier must define the required dynamic attachment stiffness of body attachment points for the wiper system prior to the concept phase conclusion.

#### Wiping Noise Test
The test is subjective and conducted during summer and winter driving tests of PT-cars. Conditions simulate customer-relevant driving environments. Acceptance at complete vehicle level depends on meeting or exceeding acoustic evaluations rated as “acoustically fair,” meaning a satisfied customer in all driving, standstill, and idling conditions.

#### Subjective Sound Requirements
- No judder or squeak should be audible under any condition.
- Relay noise in interval mode should not be audible during idle.
- The reversal thumb sound of wiper blades should result in a single audible event.

#### Objective Sound Requirements
*Details are referenced in subsequent sections.*
Page 17
The 10% percentile of the A-weighted level corresponds well to the maximum peaks of the wiper sound during the reversal thump impulse. The 10% percentile of the A-weighted level must not exceed 55dB(A) for interval mode and stage 1, and 58dB(A) for the highest stage. The 50% percentile of the A-weighted level corresponds well to the motor noise in between the reversal thumps. The 50% percentile of the A-weighted level must not exceed 45dB(A) for interval mode and stage 1, and 48dB(A) for the highest stage. The specific prominence ratio of the sound corresponds well to the whine contribution within the sound. The A-weighted specific prominence ratio must not exceed 6dB(A) at any frequency between 300Hz and 5000Hz for all stages.

**Wiper Stability**  
In the parked position, the wiper blades and arms shall not lift off the windshield or backlight or flutter when subjected to relative air speeds up to 80% of the vehicle's maximum speed but not to exceed 160 km/hr.

**Wiper Wind Noise**  
The wiper and washer systems shall not cause any objectionable noise when subjected to relative air speeds up to 80% of the vehicle's maximum speed but not to exceed 160 km/hr in all operating conditions. Subject matter experts are used to evaluate compliance with the product image objectives. Brand differentiation may dictate lower amounts of acceptable wind noise. The wiper/washer should not contribute more than one sone to wind noise.

**Relay Output Noise**  
Relays located in the interior passenger compartment shall not produce unacceptable audible noise when activated or deactivated for repetitive features or those that may be annoying to the customer. An evaluation is required with the program team and D&R engineer in all cases.

**Wind Noise**  
The park position of the windshield wipers should be aerodynamically hidden. This assessment can be conducted either:
1. Through CAD geometry by extending a line (in multiple cross sections) from the trailing edge of the hood, and ensuring that the wipers are below that line.
2. Through a physical test (using acoustic mirror or surrogate vehicle), ensuring the noise contribution of the wipers is less than 0.3 sones. The surrogate vehicle option should only be used if the hood, cowl, and windshield shape are the same as the new program (i.e., carryover).

### 3.7 Labeling of Parts  
Suppliers must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Suppliers must include figures showing the position of labeling on parts (position labels setup with pictures).
