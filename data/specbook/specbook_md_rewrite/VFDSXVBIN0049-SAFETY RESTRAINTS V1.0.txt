At parking length, the retraction force is between 2.0 N and 2.3 N under consideration of the spring tolerances. As per tests, the retraction force is a minimum of 80% of the force in new condition.  
- Vehicle- and belt strap-sensitive locking systems are in park position to park position + 100 mm in turned-off condition (to be offered as an option).

7.3 Homologation and Safety Regulation Requirements.  

7.3.1 North America.  
a. Homologation and Safety Regulation Activities.  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., European, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.  

b. Self-Certification and Test Reports.  
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers conduct tests as specified in certain of the FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
The supplier should also familiarize themselves with the laboratory test procedures(*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS. (*) Refer Appendix 8 of Manufacturer_Handbook.  

c. Duty to Notify VinFast of Non-Compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS or European Regulations.  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
Page 17
7.3.2 Europe

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities  
The Supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.

b. Test report(s) and Certificate(s)  
The supplier is responsible for ensuring their part(s), product(s) or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain of the UN-ECE at authorized technical service(s).  
The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.

VinFast also requests suppliers to provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings to be submitted to the relevant authorities in order to get certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any).

The Supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an UN-ECE regulation or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  

The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
