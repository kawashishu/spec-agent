### Section: AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking)  

#### Key Parameters:  

1. **US NCAP/IIHS Ratings:**  
   - 5 Stars/AdorSup for both markets.  
   - Range of Operative speeds: CCRs, CCRm, CCRb: 6/9 ≤ x ≤ 130 km/h.  
   - Range of Operative Speeds for C2P: 6/9 ≤ x ≤ 65 km/h.  

2. **Testing Conditions:**  
   - CCRs VUT Speed (Avoidance): ≤ 42 km/h.  
   - CCRs VUT Speed (Mitigation ≥30 km/h): 42 < x ≤ 85 km/h.  
   - CCRm Relative Speed (Avoidance): ≤ 42 km/h.  
   - CCRm Relative Speed (Mitigation ≥30 km/h): 42 < x ≤ 62 km/h.  
   - CCRb Range of detection of target deceleration: 1.5 ≤ x m/s².  

3. **Activation Thresholds:**  
   - CCRb TTC value for activation: ≥ 0.7 seconds for various test cases in US/ASEAN/Euro NCAP procedures.  
   - No activation while driving over specific steel plates of dimensions 3.7 m x 2.4 m x 25 mm.  

4. **Pedestrian Scenarios:**
   - Stationary Pedestrian Crossing (Adult): Avoidance ≤ 42 km/h.  
   - Stationary Pedestrian Crossing (Child): Avoidance ≤ 42 km/h.  
   - Longitudinal Pedestrian (Adult): Avoidance ≤ 42 km/h.  
   - Longitudinal Pedestrian (Child): Avoidance ≤ 42 km/h.  
   - When detecting a crossing pedestrian at a constant speed of 5 km/h, a collision warning is triggered. Braking demands ≥ 5.0 m/s²; must be aborted if no collision conditions exist.  

5. **Override and Safety Features:**  
   - Driver can interrupt warnings and braking using kick-down actions or operating indicators.  
   - Override by ≥ 70% throttle or steering efforts < 50 N.  
   - System performs self-checks, providing failure notifications.  
   - ESC compliance with UNECE reg 13H.  

6. **Design Requirements:**  
   - Activation only if driver and front passenger seat belts (if present) remain fastened.  
   - Disengagement not possible above speeds of 10 km/h.  
   - Brake lights illuminate within 350 ms after AEB activation to prevent irritation.  

7. **Operational Scope:**  
   - Maximum detectable distance (dmax): > 100 m.  
   - Minimum detectable distance with measuring capability (d1): < 3.5 m.  
   - Minimum lower detection height (dmax, d2): ≥ 0.2 m; upper height ≥ 1.1 m.  
   - Operative in low light conditions (1000 lux).  

8. **Warnings and Countermeasures:**  
   - Collision warnings include optical, audible, and/or haptic signals based on urgency.  
   - Suppression of nuisance signals aligns with ISO 15626 5.3.1 conditions.  

#### System Capabilities:  
- AEB system notifies for lane overlaps < 50%, activates for curves ≥ 500 m radius, and adjusts braking intensity during mitigation phases.  
- Countermeasures prioritize highest collision risk target vehicles, avoiding overhead detections above 4.5 m.  
- ESC and ABS integration ensures stability under braking.
