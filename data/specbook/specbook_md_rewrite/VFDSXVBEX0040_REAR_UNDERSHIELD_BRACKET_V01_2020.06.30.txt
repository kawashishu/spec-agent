Recycling.  

**Recycled Materials:**  
When selecting materials, focus should be placed on reducing the variety of materials and compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  
Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) must be preferred in light of availability. Recycled materials must be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to environmental compliance experts’ team at VinFast.  

**Recycling Scheme:**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  

- Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
- The recycling scheme provided by the contractor must show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.

## 7 Homologation and safety regulations
Safety is one of the key issues in the development and integration of automotive functionalities.

### 7.1 Homologation and safety regulation requirements
#### 7.1.1 North America
a. **Homologation and safety regulation activities**  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. European, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS).  
The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.

b. **Self-certification and test report(s)**  
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale.  
VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  
(*) Refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer Handbook.

c. **Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations**  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
Page 18
The Supplier must provide assistance to responsible persons and actively provide recommendations for proper execution.
