**3 Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions**

**Colour and Trim Brochure:** VFDSXNCVC2801 – VFe34S (VF7)_Appendix_8_Color and Material_Exterior.  
The roof trim is part of the exterior trim and functional black for VFe34S.

It is mounted on top of the vehicle, interfacing with the body side outer and panel roof/steel roof to decorate the roof.  
They are controlled with six degrees of freedom with primary, secondary, and tertiary datums defined below in the datum strategy.  

Roof trim method of manufacture is extrusion moulding, while the front and rear covers use injection moulding.  
The component should perform in all conditions. The dimensions should remain stable and should exhibit no color or gloss change or detrimental effect when exposed to extreme conditions (-40°C to +100°C).

**General:**  
The development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies shall be optimized to avoid defects and ensure reliability. Zero complaints (zero faults) shall occur upon delivery and throughout the average service life.

**Overall Function:**  
**Development targets:**
- Prevention of functional and quality problems arising from existing systems.
- Use of standard and common parts wherever feasible or reasonable.
- Process reliability during production, packaging, transport, and assembly.
- Minimization of effort for production sequences, including production, packaging, transport, and track-side assembly.
- Prevention of displacement.
- Integration of all pertinent partners in the overall process of part packaging (Simultaneous Engineering), starting from the concept phase onward. Early inclusion of developers of neighboring components.
- General cost reduction compared to predecessor models.
- Functionality must remain intact within the requested temperature range.

**Stiffness / Rigidity / Stability of Shape:**
- Specifically in the area of the operating elements, the components and bracket designs must ensure no instability is noticeable.
- Irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, and visible waviness under climatic change loads are strictly prohibited.

**Serviceability:**  
Mounting/dismounting requirements follow VFDST00009000.

**NVH:**  
The roof trim must meet NVH requirements.

**Safety:**  
Not applicable.

Product characteristics:

- The material-specific thermal expansions have to be considered during the definition of the gap tolerances.
- The deformation after climate test has to be under the fixed tolerance of flush and gap dimension.
- Tolerance analyses must be submitted to the departments or persons responsible for the development.
- Assemble ability with adjoining components.
- Safety of function under all loads stated in drawings, test specifications, quality specifications, and texts of laws.
- Avoiding of noise caused by the function of components or by joints due to unfavorable tolerances.
- With regard to safety-relevant matters, proof must be given that the respective legal requirements have been met.
- All components have to be functional over the whole temperature range.

The complete vehicle has to pass the following tests:

- Wading tests.
- Splash tests.
- Rain tests with different water flow rates and vehicle in tilted positions.
- Wash tests with all possible kinds of washing methods, including high pressure.
- Dust driving test.
- Wet pollution test (vehicle on wet road behind lead vehicle).
