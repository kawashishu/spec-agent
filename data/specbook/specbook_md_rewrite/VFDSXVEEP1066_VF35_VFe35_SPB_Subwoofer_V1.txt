This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the subwoofer. The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics. The Contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements. Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details have to be reported immediately. The contractor is a "System Development Supplier," with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

2.2 Initial Situation and Objective.
The system is planned for use in various vehicle models, for various country-specific packages, and for various combinations of optional equipment. Adaptation of system functions to a given vehicle shall be accomplished by modular component population of the necessary modules and coding via the diagnostics interface. The design of the subwoofer shall avoid noise generation like squeak and rattle as well as noise generation due to the moving parts. Furthermore, the electronics shall be designed to work without a fan or external cooling under the required temperature conditions.

2.3 Classification of the System / Component.
Refer to 5.1 Technical requirement.

2.4 Execution Regulations.
VF35/VFe35 will be developed for Vietnam, US/Canada, and EU markets. Consequently, all amplifiers should consider the regulations and demands of the EU and US markets.

2.5 Development and Supply Scope.

Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. <100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.  

**Misuse events:**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned so that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or neighboring components (principle "deformation before break").  

5.17.2 Vibration Behavior.  
**NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior:**  
The maximum vibration level must be defined by the supplier (brackets must be developed to avoid resonances below a certain frequency).  
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle must not be less than 35Hz. Thus, the supplier must align the fixation concept with VinFast. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in Chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.  

5.17.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics.  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

### 5.17 Mechanical Requirements

#### 5.17.4 Deformation
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

#### 5.17.5 Pressure
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

#### 5.17.6 NVH/Acoustic Performance

**Fan:**  
If the electrical control unit contains cooling fans, no tonal frequency bands are acceptable (adjacent bars must not exceed 3dB).

**Audio Acoustics:**  
Leakage and rattle-free mounting of the speakers must be possible. This includes:
- Wide basket mounting interface.
- Foam ring attached to basket.
- Rigid basket material.
- Basket front side must allow sealed connection to the speaker grille through a flat surface or foam ring attachment.

The component must remain stable over time. No deformation or shrinkage due to:
- Temperature.
- Moisture.
- Dirt.
- UV radiation.

Adhesion of glues must meet the specified requirements for membrane, suspension, voice coil, dust cap, and membrane glue.

#### Req ID: 30560  
**Check-in Date:** 11.07.18  
**S&R, General:**  
Noises perceived as disturbing by customers must be eliminated through appropriate selection of materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. Suppliers must guarantee that components remain free of disturbing noises in their vehicle environment and geometry integration under all conditions, including:
- Vehicle and audio system excitation.
- Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).
- Fixed component service life.

Squeak and rattle noises due to body excitation (e.g. wind load, torsional flexing) are not allowable, even if real relative movements develop on the surface. This must be ensured throughout the entire operating and environmental conditions. Testing requirements must be coordinated with the testing team.

The supplier must actively support the development of vibration and acoustic behavior within the complete vehicle environment. This ensures constant acoustic quality of delivered parts and includes proactive problem-solving, proposing solutions, and providing necessary comparison and evaluation parts free of charge.
