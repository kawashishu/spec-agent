- Irregular shapes of joints, excessive clearance, visible waviness under climatic change loads are prohibited.

Door trim requirements:
- No detaching, fracturing, or splitting of parts is allowed, neither at crash tests nor at airbag deployment, even not in low temperature range.
Page 19
### Materials

- Material and production-compliant design layout of the components for avoiding production-related surface flaws/defects (tool parting points/lines, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, stress zones, etc.).
- Material-compliant fits, curvatures, corners, allowing visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces.
- Uniform, proportionally accurate, and material-compliant run-out of component edges, corners, and ribs.
- Selection of concepts and production methods that facilitate homogeneous structures and grain structures.
- Avoidance of visible screw points and screw point covers as well as dummy covers.
- Surfaces free of burrs in the visual and haptic zone.
- No view of other parts (it should not be possible to recognize other components through grilles, trim covers, indentations, joints, and cavities; neat and tidy overall impression).
- Ensuring correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts with regard to disturbance noise.
- Free of disturbing noise and odor in contact with the environment.

### Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization
To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) must be provided via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks/check of deployment per component).
- After deployment of pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues must remain that are classified as toxic waste or hazardous substances by valid waste legislation. Otherwise, components must be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances.
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components must be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle/via feedback at the deployment tool).

VinFast Management System VFDSXVBIN0007. Version: 1. Uncontrolled copy when printed.

Marking of positions of pyrotechnical components is required (particularly hidden components such as battery safety terminal clamps and active safety headrests). In case of non-deployment, pyrotechnical components must be removed. Pre-dismantling should be avoided when technically possible (ensure accessibility of fasteners).

### Recycling:
#### Recycled Materials:
Material selection should focus on reducing variety and ensuring compatibility with proven recycling technologies. Preferred materials include recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, and recycled thermoplastics. These materials must be marked per parts marking standards in this specification book and reported to VinFast’s environmental compliance team.

#### Recycling Scheme:
A recycling scheme must be provided, including:
- Simple layout of the recycling process for components.
- Information on preferred recycling partners.
- Cost estimates.

Contractors must deliver the recycling scheme to VinFast’s environmental experts before the milestone Production Try-Out (PTO).

### Material Requirements & Corrosion:
Please refer to VinFast’s Request for Quotation.

### Recycling: Recycled Materials  
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  
Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recycles and post-production recycles, e.g. recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert team at VINFAST.  

---

### Recycling Scheme  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  

The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  

Recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental expert team at VINFAST before the milestone PTO (Production Try-Out).  

---

### Material Requirements & Corrosion  
Please refer to the VINFAST Request for Quotation.  

---

### Additional Requirements  
- **Aggressive Media / Cleaning Compound:**  
  Resistance against aggressive media, e.g. tobacco smoke and cleaning agents, is necessary.  
  Blank and painted injection molding components must not be affected by reagents (e.g., cola, sun cream, etc.), neither in optic nor in function.  
  Conventional cleanser must not cause any optic or functional effects to components.  

- **Contamination:**  
  The contamination impassiveness has to be ensured in general. The surfaces have to be easy to clean.  

---

### Corrosion Requirements Interior  
- Screws, bolts on handles, mirrors.  
- Key parts such as seat belts, trunk areas, seat structures, invisible structural parts, and vehicle tooling.  

**Generally:**  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

---

### Corrosion Tests  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

#### Component Test for Metallic Surfaces  
- **Fog Test:** ISO6270 CH (Acceptance criteria: see below).  
- **Salt Spray Test:** ISO9227 (Acceptance criteria: see below).  

#### For Organic Coatings  
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B (Acceptance criteria: see below).  

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.  

---

### Test Criteria  

| **Area**         | **Corrosivity** | **Metallic coatings**    | **Organic coatings**          | **Pass Criteria**       |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low            | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227          | 96 h → ISO6270 CH       | No red rust            |
| Exterior          | Medium          | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227     | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust        |
Page 37
Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:  
- Rust creep according to ISO4628-8:  
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1-2 mm.  
- Blistering:  
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  
- Edge corrosion:  
  - ≤ 10%  
- Weld seam corrosion:  
  - ≤ 5%  
- Degree of rusting:  
  - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).  

The interior is considered as a dry area with low corrosivity. Exceptions might include the floor area or positions where wetness/abrasion from shoes or liquids like juices may cause corrosion.  

Guidelines:  
- Combining different metals should avoid galvanic corrosion by applying coatings.  
- Edges, especially painted edges, must be burr-free to ensure good edge coverage and avoid wear.  
- Uncoated seat structure (blank steel): New parts must be corrosion-free. Areas prone to corrosion must not be visible to the customer. Extreme positions of seat rests must be considered.  
- For invisible areas, test criteria may be less strict, provided visible areas remain free of corrosion and lifetime functionality is guaranteed.  

Vehicle tooling:  
- Generally stored in the trunk with low corrosivity exposure.  
- Tool surfaces subject to wear may have medium corrosivity requirements.  

Refer to:  
- Corrosion requirements for electric components.  

**Test Plan**  
The test plan outlines:  
- Responsibility for testing, scheduling, and required testing devices.  
- Display of testing results in a visually appropriate manner and progress updates throughout testing.  
- Ensuring test result control at all times.  
- Verification of test results by VinFast if needed, with parts provision for free by SDS.  

Test procedures and documentation must be approved by VinFast's validation engineer and component lead engineer.  

Additional requirements:  
- Weekly updates during the testing phase or when new data arises due to development changes.  
- SDS responsibility for complete component safeguard, timely testing, approval, and/or re-testing for negative results.  
- Submission of all relevant test protocols and reports to VinFast for verification. SDS must also accommodate any VinFast attendance at testing sites.  

Deviations from approved testing procedures require mutual agreement between VinFast and SDS.
Page 38
If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing must be redone at the cost of the SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests must be re-planned, and the retesting must be paid for by the SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

**Following data must be included in the DVP&R:**
- Testing with a declaration of standard, norm, or legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing setup with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and flow of the testing (in the form of a project plan).
- Part variant and description of part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible for using the DVP&R template provided by the VINFAST testing department. The content of the DVP&R remains the responsibility of the SDS.

The SDS has to plan a DVP for every stage of development, including prototypes (if defined in the master timing chart) and the serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens must be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST. The test plan should be coordinated and jointly approved by VINFAST departments and the SDS. The DVP&R must be agreed upon between the VINFAST test department and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R should be reviewed weekly. In case of scheduling delays, the SDS must deliver proposals to meet the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS must draft a test plan for each individual component.

---

**Testing**

**General**
The SDS prepares a detailed and backdated testing plan on time, considering the vehicle timing chart.

It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.

To prevent double testing, mechanical and electrical tests must be combined whenever possible.

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS must be explicitly stated in the SDS quotation and ordered by the SDS from VINFAST.

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be included in the delivery.

Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST testing department must be provided by the SDS free of charge.

The SDS must ensure compliance with all relevant legislations specific to its components. Additionally, fulfillment of all internal VINFAST requirements described in the performance specification must be guaranteed. All test results must be documented with photos within the test reports and submitted to VINFAST.
Page 39
All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved. All tests must be documented according to VINFAST standard, alternatively to SDS standard, if this is accepted by VINFAST. 

The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification. The tests have to be brought in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.

Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (coordinated with the test department). VINFAST "Logistics" determines the number of sample parts. VINFAST "Purchase" orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

### Release by test-departments
The responsible VINFAST test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved from the SDS and during the complete vehicles integration tests. The SDS must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any problems (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the SDS must submit a test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions (to keep all milestones, observe all targets, etc.).

**OK or NOK result** needs to be stated on the first sheet of the report.

### Analyses, Test-Reports
The SDS has to provide measurement reports according to VINFAST specification (VFDST00008900) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts. After the individual tests, the test samples have to be analyzed in detail.

The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report has to be handed over to the responsible VINFAST department for release.

Upon request, the results together with the documentation of the tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development) are to be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests carried out parallel to series production are to be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.

**Virtual testing**
Suitable calculation methods must be used and adequately detailed calculation models created by the SDS to secure, verify, and effectively optimize the component properties defined in technical specifications, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations. Mechanical properties such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety are to be secured using FEM calculations.

Tool-dimensioning for injection molding must be optimized through corresponding simulations. On request, operative calculation models representing the respective development status must be made available to VINFAST’s technical departments for internal calculations and integration.

If requested by VINFAST, the SDS must provide suitable FEM models at no extra cost. Tests conducted by the SDS, according to the evaluation plan, must be documented with calculations (e.g., FEM) before tool dimensioning.

**Component testing**
Listed component tests are basic requirements. Detailed required testing is defined in the DVP (Design Verification Plan) and agreed upon between VINFAST and the SDS, making it binding:

No distortion and functional disturbances are permitted across the entire functional temperature range. Use of materials with significantly varying thermal expansion coefficients must ensure preserved behavior and performance.
Page 42
The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.

These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VINFAST and the SDS, and will be binding.

If VINFAST orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

### Geometrical Integration

**RPS (Reference Position System):** The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. An RPS-concept for the design has to be developed with quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS-system VFDST00000011 [28] according to interior and BIW department.

**Tolerance Analyses:** 
The following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems, including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses
- Thermal change tests across all climate terms
- Thermal expansion has to be considered

**Arrangements:** Arrangements are necessary in order to ensure the required gap dimension of components.

**Clearance Wiring Harness:** For fixing the wiring harness on the door trim, a minimum distance of 8mm to surrounding parts is needed.

**Side Airbag:** The minimum distance between the door trim and side airbag must be at least 70mm.

**Armrest/Handrail:** Armrest and handrail should be in the dummy range of the seat adjustment field on the same Y-situation, with a maximum difference of 10mm.

**IP (Instrument Panel):** Clearance to the lateral cover and verification of the glove box opening.

**Rear Seat:** Verification of the backrest folding.

Shape and position tolerances and general tolerances have to be considered.
