## Description and Scope of Work

### 5.1 Technical Requirement

#### 5.1.1 Project Requirements

##### 5.1.1.1 Quality Requirements
Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements.”  
The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.  
Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistics specifications, etc.).  
The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.  

The finished assembly should meet all dimensional and form tolerances according to **VFDST00000013**:  
- The assembly structure should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.  
- Should be designed for high-volume production.  
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifespan.  
- Emit no disturbing noises.  
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.  

**Reset After Actuation:**  
The hood must stay in the open activating position **for a minimum of 350 milliseconds after ignition**.  
After this time, no specific requirement is given.

##### 5.1.1.2 Certification
- The certification requirement is intended to verify the reliability of the product by simulating 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification depends on the supplier conducting simulated durability tests on the parts or subsystems according to VinFast’s requirements. The parts provided by the supplier must meet VinFast’s requirements, including issuing the corresponding test reports.  
- VinFast is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing. Suppliers of components and subsystems will be responsible for timely responses to identified failure reports.

5.1.1.2 Certification.
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing, and component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports.  
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. Suppliers must complete all component/subsystem tests.  
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.  
- In any event, the supplier is obligated to complete all specified test requirements.  
- The component/subsystem supplier must provide VINFAST's product release engineer with a complete component/subsystem test certification plan approved by the engineer. The plan shall include at least: number of samples, test sequence, place, and time of each test.  

5.1.2 General Description of the System / Component.
It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.  
Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers on the basis of this specification have to be agreed upon between the department having created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.  
The system developer commits himself to develop all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design-process in order to achieve:  
- System-specific requirements.  
- The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of system markets (no modifiers are permitted for rating assessments).  
- For technical proposals that exceed the offered scope of development, the supplier must identify to the client the impact on costs, quality, and time schedule.  

The technical and commercial release will be preceded by the customer according to change management.  
Passive safety requirements, which are implemented, must comply with all legal requirements of system markets acting or known with a fixed release date at the homologation date on the class B and C common platform. VINFAST shall also monitor ongoing changes of rating protocols to ensure achievement of the full vehicle target at SOP.
