**Complete vehicle is still under development.** Use dimensions provided as reference to confirm technical feasibility and provide initial quotation. More accurate dimensions/envelops will be provided once they are available.

The contact with the car body shall be on controlled and geometrically secured areas covered with pads to avoid wear of the car body and paint. The system and the packaging engineers at VinFast shall approve installation, at first theoretically and later through complete car tests.

**Clearance to surrounding components:**  
- The fuel filler pipe route must provide the maximum vertical drop, from fuel filler opening to fuel tank entry point.

Figure descriptions:
- The illustration highlights the fuel filler pipe and fuel tank connection areas, including an overview of the fuel vapor line and filler cap routing.
- Dimensions for critical elements are provided, such as the filler cap measurement of 140 mm and the filler pipe clearance of +55.063 mm.
- The diagrams visually display the configuration of the fuel system components and the spatial relationship between the fuel tank, filler pipe, and surrounding elements.

**Functional Responsibility**  
**FUEL_FILLER**  

The slope on every portion of the fuel filler pipe, from pipe inlet to fuel tank fill opening, must be at least 4° downward.  
Position of the pipe must be greater than 450 mm above the maximum fill height of the tank, and the pipe inlet angle (fill nozzle latched in position) must be 35°.  

The filler pipe must enter the tank as high up the tank as possible, preferably 50 mm below the maximum fill level, on the rear or rear side face, where it can be protected by the rear axle or spare wheel during a crash.  

The filler cap (or capless filler sealing face) must not protrude beyond the body A-surface when the filler cap is not enclosed.  

The fuel filler pipe bore must have a minimum cross-sectional area of 550 mm² for petrol.  

The fuel filler pipe profile shall be nominally circular throughout the length of the pipe, with a minor internal axis of diameter 25 mm minimum for petrol.  

The minimum tube length (L) from the beginning of the filler pipe's minor outside diameter (D) to the point of tangency of the first tube bend must be (3 x D) or 100 mm, whichever is greater.  

The filler bend radii (R) must be ≥ (2 x D) minimum and ≥ (3 x D) target.  

The angle of the first internal bend must be ≥ 120°.  

The release function of the quick connector must face away from surrounding components (e.g., body) to prevent opening of the quick connector (QC) when installed under the vehicle.

9 Supplier responsibilities  
The supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.  

### Customer service requirements  
#### After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

#### Spare Parts Support Cycle  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall not be shorter than 10 years after VINFAST starts production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.  

#### Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).
