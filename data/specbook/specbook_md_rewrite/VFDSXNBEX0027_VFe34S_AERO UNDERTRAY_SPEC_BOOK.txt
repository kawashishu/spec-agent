Aero under trays are part of the Exterior functional group for VF7 (VFe34S). They are mainly mounted on the FR sub-frame (at front) and RR sub-frame (at the rear). The purpose of the parts is to protect the cabin, engine bay, and internal components from dirt, mud, slush, snow, stone chipping, and to improve aerodynamics and NVH performance of the vehicle.

The parts are non-grained plastics (PP+GF20). The component should be capable of performing under all conditions. The dimensions should be stable and shall have no color or gloss change and shouldn’t show any detrimental effect when exposed to extreme conditions ranging from -40°C to +120°C.
