Nothing in this standard supersedes applicable laws and regulations.

5.3 Material Requirement.
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).

Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in lowest positions. Also, avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro-movements. Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.

**Edge Coverage:** Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

- Protect terminals and connections from humidity and micro-vibrations to prevent fretting corrosion.
Page 13
Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Reason: Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.

Prevention of stone chipping issues:
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone-hitting risk, choose part materials and paint which have the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts which have edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.

5.4 Traceability.
For part requirements, follow specifications, please refer to VinFast standard VFDST00010502 and VFDST00010501.

5.5 Labeling of Parts.
Suppliers follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. The supplier needs to make a figure for label position on parts (position labels set up with pictures).

5.6 Vehicle Architecture.

Vehicle Architecture.
The complete vehicle must pass the requirements from the vehicle layout plans. All changes on parts and modules, which are affecting the vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence of the vehicle, have to be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation. The definition and technical geometric specifications regarding complete vehicle dimensions in interior and exterior are based on GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.
Page 14
Styling Technique Convergence.

All changes on parts and modules, which are affecting the Exterior and/or Interior styling surfaces of the vehicle, have to be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation. Part or system related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops have to be provided from the supplier (e.g. tooling demands, assembly sequence), based on defined requirements from VinFast module leads. Technical input can be provided as office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.

5.7 Vehicle Safety.

In Case of safety-relevant parts:  
Cooperation with the MSE vehicle safety department:  
- Occupant survival area integrity must not be violated by behavior; e.g., no edges below 3.2 mm during and after impact are allowed.  
- Part/system CAE models must be provided on demand, e.g., to support and reach vehicle data freeze milestones. It must be realized within LsDyna, as well as validated, numerical and physical stable.  
- FE meshes must be homogeneous, according to part axles/geometry, and with a density of 8–10 mm. In case of non-keeping meshing guidelines, FE meshes must be re-worked.  
- For generating validated CAE material cards, activities must be planned, performed, and financed by the supplier. This includes principle tests on systems as well as components.  

5.8 Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability).

- Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions (operating loads and special events).  
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics derived from the application profile.  
- Definition of all requirements to ensure sufficient operational strength for the complete vehicle, subsystems, and components (this technical specification is the basis for all system and component technical specifications).  
- Mounting force must be lower than dismounting force.
