### 5.3 Material Requirement & Corrosion  
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).
Page 11
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. Corrosivity Low: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
2. Corrosivity Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.
3. High Corrosivity: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. Very High Corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity. 
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This also includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers). 

Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in lowest positions. 
Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can act as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements. 

Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.

Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.

### Corrosion Tests
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

#### Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:
- **Salt Spray Test:** ISO9227, acceptance criteria specified.

#### For Organic Coatings:
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria specified.

Alternative tests are possible, if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

Page 13
Execute component test with assembled sub-system, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

**Chromed metal parts:**  
240h NSS ISO9227 without base material corrosion.

**Chromed plastic parts:**  
CASS-Test according to DIN EN ISO 9227; duration:  
- 48h for Exterior.  
- 24h for Interior.  
Acceptance criteria: no surface defects.  
Also: 240h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.

**Electric parts:**  
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.  
Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness.  
Use surface treatment on steel fasteners, etc., that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.  
The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  
**Terminals, connectors:** Do not place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness; electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  
**Groundings:** Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.  

**Aluminium/sealing surfaces:**  
Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of >1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.

**Prevention of stone chipping issues:**  
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:  
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.  
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help prevent severe issues.  
- In areas of high stone-hitting risk, choose part materials and paint which have the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.

6.2 Environmental Compatibility.

The minimization of environmental impacts of a product through the complete life cycle is a key factor for future development of innovative products.

A minimization of environmental impacts of a product requires:
- Use of recyclable materials.
- Use of recycled materials and renewable resources.
- Prevention of hazardous substances.
Page 17
Minimization of environmental impacts includes strategies such as minimizing emissions including odors, reducing the consumption of resources, preventing waste, marking parts for identification at the end of life, and ensuring proper depollution and drainage at the end of life.

**Key Standards to Meet**:  
- **Reuse, Recycling & Recoverability obligations for vehicles, components, and parts acc. UN Regulation No. 133.**  
- **Parts marking for identification of materials at the end of life**: Vehicles, components, and parts acc. ISO standards.  
- **Prohibition & Restriction of substances**: Compliance with:  
    - Global Automotive Declarable Substances List (GADSL).  
    - Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (incl. national chemical inventory 2017).

    - ELV Directive 2000/53/EC and REACH (EC) No 1907/2006.  
    - Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 regarding persistent organic pollutants.  
- **Conflict Mineral Reporting** from suppliers using tin, tungsten, tantalum, or gold in their production, in line with US Dodd-Frank Act Sec.1502 (applicable to companies listed on the US stock exchanges).  
- **Reduction of Global Warming Potential and lifecycle resource consumption**: Environmental impact analysis according to ISO 14040 methodology.

**Material Information and Parts Marking**:  
Suppliers must ensure compliance with restrictions on prohibited and restricted substances for all parts throughout their life cycle.  
- **IMDS Compliance**: Suppliers must provide PPAP Material Data Sheets (MDS) in IMDS following IMDS Rules (IMDS 001 and Recommendations 002-022). Updates are required for modifications.  
- **IMDS Submissions**: Material data sheets must be submitted to VinFast IMDS-ID 214435.  
- **Parts Marking**: Marking should follow the principle of concise identification ("as few characters as possible but as many as necessary"). Designations defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes precedence) must be used. Codes must appear in arrowed brackets (e.g., `<MaterialType>`).
Page 18
Material safety data sheets (SDS) according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (incl. national chemical inventory 2017) have to be provided to VinFast for milestone concept confirmation. Consider local rules for SDS creation and UN-guidelines acc. GHS Globally Harmonized System of Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Chemicals.

### Emissions & Toxicology
Not applicable.

### Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization
Not applicable.

### Recycling
#### Recycled Materials
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’). Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g. recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert’s team at VinFast.

#### Recycling Scheme
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### Evaporative Emissions
Not applicable.

### Drainage and Depollution
No specific content provided.
Page 19
Complete drainage of fluids is required for safe and environmentally friendly End-of-Life vehicle treatment. For complete removal, fluid niches and pockets shall be avoided. Drainage schemes, including virtual or physical test protocols, with information on the type of drained fluids, the amount (in weight-%), and absolute mass (in kg) must be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before the milestone PTO (Production Try-Out).

### 7 Homologation and safety regulations
