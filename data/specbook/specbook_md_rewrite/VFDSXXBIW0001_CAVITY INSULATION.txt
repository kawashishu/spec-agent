3.14 Corrosion Resistance. Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

3.15 Interfaces. In all tolerance limit positions, the distance to adjacent components determined using the concept of functional dimensions shall be met. The joint air gap between components joined during assembly may not be larger than absolutely necessary for assembly purposes. The joint air gap value determined using the concept of functional dimensions shall be met.

3.16 Method of Connection. The type of connection is determined by the manufacturer and the development department. Hole sizes and positions, sheet metal cuts, as well as contact surfaces required for mounting the moulded part, and their tolerances must be submitted to the Development Department by the manufacturer on time (approx. 6 weeks prior to release). The most cost-effective and safest-to-manufacture fastening is to be selected and coordinated with the development department. The manufacturer is responsible for the type of connection and the design of the shape. Mounting is assessed together with Development and Manufacturing.

The moulded part with its fastening element must be aligned with the point and clamping plan. The moulded parts must be secured against rotation and loss in the body construction as well as secure against washing out in cleaning and KTL (cathodic electro-coating) baths. Danger of mix-up (left/ right vehicle side and position within the vehicle) must be avoided. Holes caused by the mounting method (e.g., clips hole, openings) must be completely sealed by the foaming materials. Leaking of swelling material is not permitted in contact areas of passenger compartment trim panels.

3.17 Sealing of Bodywork Cavities. Moulded parts are used to seal off body cavities. The moulded part design must ensure that the cavity is sealed after expansion. Moulded parts are used for acoustic optimization. However, they may also be used for sealing purposes [VFDST00037401], [VFDST00030601, VFDST00030701]. Molded parts are also used as supporting elements to locally increase the dent resistance of the outer skin.
Page 14
### 3.18 Buckling Strength, Buckling Resistance of Outer Skin Panel
Molded parts are also used as supporting elements to locally increase the dent resistance of the outer skin.

### 3.19 No Surface Impact
The molded parts must not cause any surface errors on outer panel sections (e.g., sink marks, ripples). This also applies to secondary surface areas.

### 3.20 Layout
The molded parts can be bordered with metal sheet or plastic on one or both sides. They can also be developed without a border edge.  
The layout must be coordinated with the Development Department.

### 3.21 Traceability
For part requirements, follow specification as per VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

### 3.22 Labeling of Parts
Suppliers must follow VinFast standard VFDST00000010. Position labels must be set up with figures (e.g., stick locations shown in pictures).

### 3.23 Testing and Validation
The supplier is responsible for the Design Validation Process (DVP) of components/sub-systems, ensuring all DVP activities are completed prior to those for the complete vehicle.  
All reliability tests (e.g., service life tests) of components must adhere to the definitions of random sampling and data evaluations as per VFDST00034100. Additionally, electrical and electronic evaluations follow CES_VINFAST guidelines for electric requirements (CES_VINFAST_EE_VFDSP50000004_General_Electric, CES_VINFAST_EE_VFDSP50000048_High Current Consumers, ISO 16750).  

If a test schedule with random sample sizes is specified for the development object, it applies as a minimum standard.  
Testing capabilities should be incorporated early in development stages. Systematic testing is to be coordinated with Quality Assurance, which evaluates physical characteristics using assessments of exposed sections on finalized bodies.

Detailed schedules and documentation requirements are issued via the Service Level Agreement. Suppliers must verify emission properties in collaboration with "Plastics Development, Process Engineering". Measurements must be performed by VinFast-approved test institutions. Consulting the latest list of approved institutions is recommended.

Refer to VFDST00002607 for adhesive and sealing material requirements used in the body shop, as well as foaming insert requirements and associated tests.  
Testing will be conducted only on KTL-coated surfaces unless specifically indicated otherwise. Standard testing involves uncoated sheet metal components, either hot-dip galvanized steel or aluminum (Ti/Zr coating as requested).

### Conclusion
Document requirements emphasize thorough material testing, validation, marking, and traceability for assembly, acoustic optimization, and vehicle body integrity. Suppliers must adhere to all testing standards and specifications to meet VinFast's quality expectations.
Page 15
The respective applicable standard test panels are described in VFDST00040600. The adhesion on the respective KTL coat as applied in a particular plant shall be validated in the target plant within the frame of prototype validation. If necessary, the adhesion may be simulated by the respective lab of the production site.

Placement in the oven is to be taken from VFDST00039800. Final curing takes place in the series KTL oven or by storage in the lab convection oven for 25 min at 175°C. The complete process window shall be considered and ensured by the material developer: minimum 10 min at 165°C, maximum 15 min at 195°C object temperature. Unless specified otherwise in special notes, all temperature conditions in this standard relate to oven exposure times and oven temperature (pre-heated oven).

For aluminium test bodies instead of the corrosion test stipulated in the respective specification, the Scab-test (VFDST00040800) shall always be applied (unless otherwise agreed, 40 circles = 8 weeks). As a rule, all changes on the material (see VFDST00040700) shall be reported to the “Technical Laboratory / Process Material Laboratory”.

Carrier materials (plastic) shall be contained independently of the foam element in VFDST00000300 and are not treated in this Standard.

### 3.24 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts  
Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is described in the VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing).  
For each step of the process, the supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get "OK Shape", "OKTG", and AAR Approval.  
The process will start in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS.  
The supplier has to include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.
