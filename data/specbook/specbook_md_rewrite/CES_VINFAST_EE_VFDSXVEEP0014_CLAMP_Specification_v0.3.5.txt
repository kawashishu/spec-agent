2 Introduction.

2.1 Scope of the Document.  
The purpose of this document is to describe the functionality of clamps used in the vehicle - especially which ECU is power supplied with the different clamps and which clamp/signal will be managed by the different control units. Some ECUs are hardwired connected to specific terminal clamps, others require logical clamps/signals via CAN/LIN/Flex-Ray and the rest needs hardwired and logical clamp information. All ECUs are receiving the information about the clamp status via the CAN/LIN/Flex-Ray bus. So, the aim of the clamp concept is to define the functionality of all clamps used in the vehicle and to ensure that a failure at the bus or hardwired connection of the E/E network must not cause dangerous states.

This clamp specification is specified for the VINFAST platform. The concept is designed for all different possible vehicle variants.  
Clamps availability shall be determined by the actual vehicle state depending on whether the vehicle is asleep or awake. Some clamps have special timing parameters. The transition from one state to another depends on different input parameters.

2.2 Terms and Definitions.  
The following list of terms and definitions are used throughout this document with the given meaning.

2.2.1 Abbreviations.

3 System Description – BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle)

3.1 General Description of Clamps, Conditions, and Events.

A clamp is an electric terminal, which is used as a source to supply any kind of electric/electronic components of a vehicle. Depending on the state of the vehicle (e.g., idleness, moving), different loads need different clamps.

The vehicle states dependent on vehicle speed are defined in the following table in order to retrieve a consistent meaning in all specifications:

Table 4: Definition of vehicle states in dependence of vehicle speed:
- Vehicle Stop:  v ≤ 3 km/h
- Vehicle Moving: v > 3 km/h

It has to be differentiated between hardware clamps and logical clamps.

3.2 Hardwired Clamp.

A hardwired clamp is a physical connection between Vbat and ECU and can be used as a power supply or as a signal input. 

The source is either a direct connection to the battery or an indirect one via a switched relay or an electronic driver.

It can be differentiated between two types of hardware clamps:
- Permanent clamp.
- Switched clamp.

3.3 Permanent Clamp.

The load is connected directly to the battery; this means the clamp is always ON, except when the battery is disconnected.

A clamp is an electric terminal, which is used as a source to supply any kind of electric/electronic components of a vehicle. Depending on the state of the vehicle (e.g., idleness, moving), different loads need different clamps.  

The vehicle states are dependent on vehicle speed and are defined in the following table to provide consistent meaning in all specifications:  

| Vehicle State   | Limits | Unit   |  
|-----------------|--------|--------|  
| Vehicle Stop    | v ≤ 3  | km/h   |  
| Vehicle Moving  | v > 3  | km/h   |  

It is necessary to differentiate between hardware clamps and logical clamps.  

3.2 Hardwired Clamp.  
A hardwired clamp is a physical connection between Vbat and ECU and can be used as a power supply or signal input.  

The source is either a direct connection to the battery or an indirect one via a switched relay or an electronic driver.  

Types of hardware clamps:  
- Permanent Clamp.  
- Switched Clamp.  

3.3 Permanent Clamp.  
Permanent Clamp Definition: The load is connected directly to the battery, meaning the clamp is always ON, except when the battery is disconnected. Permanent clamps include:  
- CL31 (Battery ground/negative terminal).  
- CL30 (Vbat/positive terminal).  

3.4 Switched Clamps.  
Switched Clamp Definition: The load is connected to the source via relays, switches, or electronic drivers. Switched clamps shall be switched ON and OFF by the module holding the clamp logic.  

Examples of Switched Clamps:  
- CL30s (by BCM via relay).  
- CL30s_light (by BCM via relay).  
- CLR (by BCM via relay).  
- CL15_1 (by BCM via relay).  
- CL30_C (by BCM via relay).  

3.5 Logical Clamps.  
Logical Clamp Definition: A logical clamp is part of a CAN message, which includes information about the switched states of hardwired clamps as presented in a value table. A logical clamp uses the same name as the hardware clamp, appended with "_L."  

The active clamp values are defined below as a 2-bit binary value table:  

| Value | Comment       |  
|-------|---------------|  
| 0x00  | OFF           |  
| 0x01  | ON            |  
| 0x10  | Failure       |  
| 0x11  | Signal Invalid |  

Table 5: Example for logical clamps.

The following messages and signals are used in the CAN Network to describe logical clamps.

| t30s_delay       | Default 2 min | For details see BCM-specification [QD1] |
| t30s_light_delay | Default 2 min | For details see BCM-specification [QD1] |

**CAN Network: Conditions for Wake-up**  
- The module holding the clamp logic will be permanently powered (CL30) and contains a CAN transceiver that supports wakeup from a low-power mode given an input on the CAN bus, complying with ISO 11898-2.  
- The module holding the clamp logic will also support wakeup from a low-power mode upon detection of a local internal event or input.  
- Upon a local internal wake-up event or input, the module holding the clamp logic shall enter the correct clamp state for that given wake-up event or input.  
- The module holding the clamp logic shall begin CAN frame transmission, which consists of the following frames:  
  - NM (Network Management) frames  
  - Clamp state frames  
  - Functional frames

It is important to differentiate between hardware clamps and logical clamps.

3.2 Hardwired Clamp

A hardwired clamp is a physical connection between Vbat and ECU. It can be used as a power supply or as a signal input.

The source can be a direct connection to the battery or an indirect one via a switched relay or electronic driver.

There are two types of hardware clamps:
- Permanent clamp
- Switched clamp

---

3.3 Permanent Clamp

The load is directly connected to the battery, meaning the clamp is always ON, except when the battery is disconnected.

Permanent clamps include:
- CL31 (Battery ground/negative terminal)
- CL30 (Vbat/positive terminal)

---

3.4 Switched Clamps

The load is connected to the source via relays, switches, or electronic drivers. Switched clamps shall be switched ON and OFF by the module holding the clamp logic.

Switched clamps consist of:
- CL30s (by BCM via relay)
- CL30s_light (by BCM via relay)
- CLR (by BCM via relay)
- CL15_1 (by BCM via relay)
- CL30_C (by BCM via relay)

---

3.5 Logical Clamps

A logical clamp is part of a CAN message, representing switched states of hardwired clamps as a value table. Logical clamps share names with their hardware counterparts and have "_L" appended to the end.

The active clamp value is represented by a 2-bit binary value table:

| Value  | Comment       |
|--------|---------------|
| 0x00   | OFF           |
| 0x01   | ON            |
| 0x10   | Failure       |
| 0x11   | Signal Invalid|

Table 5: Example for logical clamps.

The following messages and signals are used within the CAN Network to describe logical clamps:

| Message              | Signal              | Transmitter |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| BCM_CLAMP_STAT       | STAT_CL_R_L         | BCM         |
| BCM_CLAMP_STAT       | STAT_CL_15_1_L      | BCM         |
| BCM_LOGICAL_CLAMP    | STAT_CL30s_L        | BCM         |
| BCM_LOGICAL_CLAMP    | STAT_CL30s_Light_L  | BCM         |

Table 6: Used messages and signals.

Summarized states are described in the following table:

| Message        | Signal         | Transmitter |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| BCM_CLAMP_STAT | STAT_Terminal  | BCM         |
| BCM_Terminal   | ST_KL          | BCM         |

3.5.2 Clamp States

Clamps described in section 5 of clamp logic shall activate or deactivate during defined periods, known as clamp states.

It is differentiated between five states:

- ON (Driver Present)
- ON (eMotor Running)
- OTA

Transitions between these states shall follow defined requirements in section 4.

Clamp states are summarized under the signal STAT_Terminal:

| Message        | Signal         | Value | Description         |
|----------------|----------------|-------|---------------------|
| BCM_CLAMP_STAT | STAT_Terminal  | 0x0   | OFF                 |

6 Transport Mode.

Transport Mode is used to reduce the drain on the battery during vehicle transportation. If enabled, the Transport Mode requirements for clamp activation take precedence. Please refer to Transport Mode specification [QD4] for the requirements.

The signal ‘BCM_Clamp_Terminal’ is used to enable and disable Transport Mode:
