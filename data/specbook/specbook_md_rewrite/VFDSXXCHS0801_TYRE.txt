Suppliers should be familiar with the laboratory test procedures used by European authorities to evaluate their products' compliance with the relevant UN-ECE regulations.

### Duty to Notify VinFast of Non-Compliance with UN-ECE Regulations
- If a supplier determines that a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in motor vehicle equipment they have produced, it is their duty to notify VinFast within five working days of discovering the issue.
- Suppliers must also propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

## 8. Deliverables

### 8.1 Technical Deliverables
The supplier's obligations are outlined in the Work Interface Chart (RASI). The following classifications define the supplier's responsibilities:

- **R: Responsible**  
  The individual charged with ensuring the proper execution of the required activities. They are authorized to request needed support from other project team members.

- **S: Support**  
  Members obligated to provide active assistance. This includes allocating capacities, incurring expenses, and transferring knowledge as necessary. They must proactively aid the responsible person in meeting expectations.

- **I: Information**  
  Entitled to receive updates and demand details from the responsible party. 

### 8.2 Details of Deliverables and RASI
