5. Description and scope of work.

5.1 Technical requirement.

5.1.1 Project Requirements.

5.1.1.1 Quality Requirements.

Please refer to VinFast “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements.”
The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistic specifications, etc.).

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.

The finished assembly should meet all dimensional and form tolerances according to VFDST00000013.

- The assembly structure should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.
- Should be designed for high-volume production.
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime.
- Emit no disturbing noises.
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.

5.1.1.2 Certification.

- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing. Component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved by the PPAP process.
- Component/subsystem integration and certification is the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier. The supplier must complete all component/subsystem tests.
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems, or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.

Material safety data sheets (SDS) according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including the national chemical inventory 2017) must be provided for milestone concept confirmation. Local rules for SDS creation and UN guidelines according to the GHS Globally Harmonized System for Classification, Labelling, and Packaging of Chemicals must be adhered to.

### 4.15.3 Recycling:

#### Recycled Materials:
Material selection should focus on reducing the variety of materials and compatibility with existing recycling procedures ("proven recycling technologies").  

#### Recycling Scheme:
Requirements for recycling include:
- Design for cost-effective recycling of parts and components at their end-of-life.  
- A clear layout of the potential recycling process for components, including preferred recycling partners and cost estimates, must be submitted by the contractor.  

#### Submission:

5.2 General CAE Requirements.  
Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL.

5.3 Material Requirements & Corrosion.  

**Additional Requirements:**  
**Corrosion, surface:**  
- For the series the FR_DR_IMPACT_BEAM_ASSY will be supplied unpainted by the supplier. The surface is slightly oiled but free of oil accumulations.  
- Suitable measures must be provided for material combinations on the support structure, e.g., steel/AL/Mg.  
- For corrosion reasons, the parts must be loaded in covered areas protected from the weather (rain, snow). Parts must be transported in closed transport vehicles (e.g., trucks with tarpaulin).  

**Generally:**  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosively position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosively Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosively Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High corrosively:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very high corrosively:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

**Corrosion tests:**  
- The parts have to pass complete vehicle corrosion tests.  

5.4 Traceability.  
- For part requirements, follow specification please refer to VinFast standard VFDST00010501.  

**Labeling of Parts:**  
- Supplier follows VinFast standard VFDST00000010.
