9 Instructions for use.
1. BMU and CSC, and between CSC and CSC, need to use twisted-pair wires. Connectors are not allowed between communication wires. The recommended wire diameter and connector terminals are 0.5mm². Refer to the definition in the ICD file for the model.
2. Module NTC preferably 10 KΩ.

10 BMS performance testing (TBD).
Reference testing report.

12. Installation instructions.  
- BMU and CSC are fixed on the bracket with M5 bolts, and the recommended locking torque is 6Nm.  
- The connectors are not allowed to be placed vertically.  
- While installing the BMS in the pack, all Bus Bar and module connectors (FPC connectors) should be connected, and the cell sampling line should be connected last. Otherwise, there will be a risk of board burning.  

**Connector sequence for CSC installation:**  
- **3 AFEs:** J1803 → J1 → J4 → J6.  
- **4 AFEs:** J1803 → J1 → J4 → J5 → J6.  

13. Connector information.  
BMU has four connectors:  
- J1802  
- J1803  
- J1801  
- J1800
