RASI is defined as follows:
- **R: Responsible**  
Responsible for proper execution of the activities to fulfill the requirements. She/he is entitled to request the necessary support from other project team members.
- **A: Approval**  
Obligation to decide/responsible for release. If no decider is defined, the person who is responsible for execution (R) is the decider.
- **S: Support**  
Obligated to active support (even if this requires capacity, expenses, and/or transfer of know-how). This project team member must proactively assist the person responsible for execution (R) in achieving the targets.
- **I: Information**  
Right to information. This team member is entitled to demand information from (R).

**5.2 Detailed Deliverables and RASI**
Timing dates of RASI must follow Timing Gates.

**6 Supplier Responsibilities**

The supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer Service Requirements**

- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup:**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier must be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

- **Spare Parts Support Cycle:**  
The support period for after-sales spare parts shall ensure the lifecycle of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST's end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts:**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly must provide VINFAST's after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. Information includes BOM tables, parts structure and function descriptions, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).
