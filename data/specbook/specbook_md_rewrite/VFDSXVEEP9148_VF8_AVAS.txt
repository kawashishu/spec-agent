### 1 General Document Guidelines  

#### 1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.  
This version is legally binding.  

This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard. Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other. All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).  

#### 1.2 Language  
This document is written in English.  

All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.  
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.  

**Shall**  
The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.  

**Should**  
The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.  

**May**  
The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

5.2 Block and Principle Diagram.  

A block and principle diagram is illustrated, showcasing the connections and functionality of the system:  

**Pin No** | **Define**  
--- | ---  
1 | CAN L  
2 | CAN H  
3 | IGN +12V  
4 | Switch or LED power supply  
5 | BATT 12V  
6 | GND  

In this diagram:  
- Pin 1 (CAN L) and Pin 2 (CAN H) represent data communication lines for the CAN bus system.  
- Pin 3 (IGN +12V) serves as the ignition power supply.  
- Pin 4 (Switch or LED power supply) provides optional connectivity for switch or LED functionality.  
- Pin 5 (BATT 12V) is the main battery connection for power.  
- Pin 6 (GND) is the ground connection for system stability.  

The visual representation includes a power source (Battery 12V), ignition source (+12V), and an optional configuration for switches or LEDs in the diagram structure.

5.3 Functions.  

5.3.1 Overview Functions Description.  
This product specification is a supplement to the released drawing and component specification for AVAS.  

5.3.2 Detailed Functions Description.  

5.3.2.1 Functions.  
When the vehicle is moving forward or backward at low speed, AVAS will generate noise which varies with vehicle speed in order to warn pedestrians. The noise should fulfill the requirements of the market. For the US, it is FMVSS141. See detailed characteristics below:  

**CHARACTERISTICS**  
- **Operating Voltage:** Min: 9 / Max: 16 / Unit: V

The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS regulations before these products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS regulations. Test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.

The supplier should be familiar with laboratory test procedures that USA/Canada governments use to evaluate compliance with their products under FMVSS/CMVSS regulations. These procedures are outlined in Appendix 8 of the Manufacturer Handbook.

### Duty to Notify VinFast of Non-Compliance or Safety-Related Defect
If a supplier determines that non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in motor vehicle equipment items it has produced:
- The supplier must notify VinFast within five working days.
- The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

### Europe

#### Homologation and Safety Regulation Activities
The supplier must ensure their parts, products, or systems comply with applicable United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) regulations.

#### Test Reports and Certificates
The supplier is responsible for ensuring their parts, products, or systems meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before these products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to:
- Conduct tests specified under UN-ECE regulations at authorized technical services.
- Provide related test reports and UN-ECE certificates to demonstrate compliance.
- Submit supporting documentation, technical information, and drawings to the relevant authorities for certification for EC vehicle type approval (if applicable).

Suppliers should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures European authorities use to evaluate compliance with UN-ECE regulations.
