3.2 Technical requirement

**OVERVIEW**

Batteries work based on the principle of a voltage differential, and at high temperatures, the electrons inside become excited which decreases the difference in voltage between the two sides of the battery. Because batteries are only manufactured to work between certain temperature extremes, they will stop working if there is no cooling system to keep it in a working range.

Cooling systems need to be able to keep the battery pack in the temperature range of about 20-40 degrees Celsius, as well as keep the temperature difference within the battery pack to a minimum (no more than 5 degrees Celsius).

The battery cooling system consists of a patented serpentine cooling pipe that winds through the battery pack and carries a flow of water-glycol coolant. Thermal contact with the cells is through their sides to transfer heat away by the Liquid system.
Page 7
There are 4 sub-assemblies in the Liquid System:

1. Cooling Inlet Line 1: This is responsible for delivering coolant into the system through designated pathways.
2. Cooling Inlet Line 2: Acts as an additional inlet line, ensuring consistent delivery of coolant flow.
3. Cooling Outlet Line: Transfers heated coolant from the system to its next designated area.
4. Cooling Outlet Line 2: Complements the outlet line by enhancing the efficiency of coolant transfer.

**Bill of Material:**
The Liquid System is composed of a patented serpentine cooling pipe that winds through the battery pack, integrating all sub-assemblies listed above to maintain temperature and heat transfer within defined parameters.
