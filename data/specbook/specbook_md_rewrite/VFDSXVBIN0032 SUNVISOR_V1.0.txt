The requirements of the following standards must be met:
- Reuse, Recycling & Recoverability obligations for vehicles, components, and parts acc. UN Regulation No. 133. 
- Parts marking for identification of materials at end of life of vehicles, components, and parts acc. ISO standards.
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances acc. Global Automotive Declarable Substances List (GADSL).
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances acc. Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including the national chemical inventory 2017).
- Prohibition & Restriction and Declaration of substances acc. California Proposition 65.
- Prohibition & Restriction and Declaration of substances acc. ELV Directive 2000/53/EC and REACH (EC) No 1907/2006.

Material information, parts marking & substance information for VinFast.
The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification must be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier. 
- The conformance to prohibited substances must be ensured by the supplier through the complete product life cycle.
- For PPAP material data sheets (MDS) in IMDS according to IMDS Rules and Guidelines IMDS 001 and IMDS Recommendations 002 - 022 are required. Updates are required for changes. Material data sheets must be provided by the supplier to VinFast IMDS-ID 214435.

Parts marking should follow the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are formatted in arrowed brackets consisting of mathematical symbols for “greater than” (>) and “less than” (<). Material safety data sheets (SDS), according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including the national chemical inventory 2017), must be provided to VinFast for milestone concept confirmation. Local rules for SDS creation and UN-guidelines acc. GHS Globally Harmonized System must be followed.

Emissions & Toxicology.

**Odor:** 
The odor behavior of the interior components must be checked according to VDA 270. Testing procedures must be agreed upon with the VinFast specialist department. Compliance with a target value <3 for odor according to these specifications must be proven by the supplier through measurement results before milestone-purchase release. ISO 12219, part 7, may be considered for optional measurement processes defined with VinFast experts.

**Interior Parts Emissions (Bag Method):**
Emissions from interior components, semi-finished products, auxiliary materials, and surface materials (foils, artificial leather, films) must be checked according to ISO 12219, part 2 ("bag method"). Measurement compliance with emissions targets defined by VinFast must be proven according to this standard.

**Harmful Substances in Components and Materials:**
Emission behavior must be analyzed on representative components. Volatile organic compounds impacting passenger compartments should be minimized. Required emission behavior measurements must align with VinFast agreements and must be done at approved testing institutes. Additional requirements may be included in project-specific documentation (e.g., Emission Guideline). Compliance with prohibited substances must follow ISO 12219, ensuring adherence through the product life cycle.
Page 14
The test result is evaluated by the specialist department of VinFast. In any case, the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health has to be attested in written form on demand. The supplier has to provide measurement results regarding VOC and fogging for the materials before the milestone purchase release.

Limits for harmful substances emitted by concerned parts and components of the complete interior compartment are defined in the VIAQ Guideline VFDSXVCVC3401.

**Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:**
Not applicable.

**Recycling:**
**Recycled Materials:**  
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  
Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred concerning availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert team at VinFast.

**Recycling Scheme:**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  
The recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

**Evaporative Emissions:**  
Not applicable.

**Drainage and Depollution:**  
Complete drainage of fluids is required for safe and environmentally friendly end-of-life vehicle treatment. For complete removal, fluid niches and pockets shall be avoided.
Page 15
