5.1 Technical Requirement.  

5.1.4 Function.  

Requirements.  
Chrome strips provide support to Glass Run Seals/Moldings and Door Primary Sealing Systems. They form (by themselves or together with other components) glass run channels. They also provide the final look in door frame areas, and thus accentuate vehicle appearance. Therefore, styling-relevant topics are to be considered.  

The requirements and functions of the development object must be fulfilled taking into account all tolerances in single parts, assemblies, and adjoining components. Tolerance investigations confirming this requirement must be provided as functional proof to the responsible development department.  

This shall apply under static and dynamic load (e.g., off-road, rough road, aerodynamic load at high speeds, etc.) under all environmental conditions throughout service life.  

In all tolerance limit positions, the distance to adjacent components determined using the concept of functional dimensions must be met.  

The requirements and functions of the object of development are to be met with all tolerances in the single parts, assemblies, and adjacent components. Tolerance analyses for the confirmation of this requirement are to be provided to the responsible development departments as proof of function.  

Adhesive specifications include a thickness of 1.5mm, while the Chrome Strip features steel with a thickness of 0.5mm.  

**Mounting Strategy Analysis:**  
The mounting strategy involves adhesive, bolts, and clips for the proper attachment of chrome strips to the vehicle structure.  

Illustration Description:  
- The diagram illustrates four distinct chrome strip components designed following vehicle requirements.
- Mounting details show how adhesive, bolt systems, and clips are utilized in the assembly process to meet performance standards.  

5.1.5 Performance Specification.  

5.1.5.1 NVH and Driving Comfort.  
N/A.  

5.1.5.2 Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability).  
- Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions (operating loads and special events).  
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristics, derived from the application profile.  
- Definition of all requirements to ensure sufficient operational strength of complete vehicles, subsystems, and components. This technical specification is the basis for all system and component technical specifications.  
- Mounting force must be lower than dismounting force.  

**Operating Loads:**  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the benchmark base vehicles on tracks defined by “VinFast.”  
The definition of the customer usage is based on the “VinFast” standard for MCE (mixed circuit Europe = long-distance durability run). The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car, which is 160,000 km.  

**Special Events:**  
Details on special events impacting operational strength are included to meet durability requirements, covering exceptional conditions or unanticipated external impacts during usage.

5.1.5 Performance Specification  

**Special events**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approximately less than 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle (e.g., ABS-braking).  

The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while ensuring no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.  

**Additional Requirements**  
N/A  

**Weight Management**  
Because the vehicle weight has a significant influence on the energy consumption of the vehicle, the major goal of weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight.  

Throughout the entire development process, attention must be paid to a weight-optimized design of all components. All weight reduction potentials must be shown by the supplier, including their impact on cost, timing, and quality.  

The whole system must not exceed a specified weight target.  

**Fuel Economy & Driving Performance**  
N/A  

**Vehicle Dynamics & Fuel System Integration**  
N/A  

**Vehicle Architecture & Ergonomics**  
The complete vehicle must pass the requirements specified in the vehicle layout plans. All changes on parts and modules affecting vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence must be immediately communicated to VinFast by the supplier for separate evaluation.  

The definition and technical geometric specifications regarding complete vehicle dimensions, both interior and exterior, are based on GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.  

**Styling Technique Convergence**  
All changes to parts and modules affecting exterior and/or interior styling surfaces of the vehicle must be immediately communicated to VinFast by the supplier for separate evaluation.  

Part or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops must be provided by the supplier.

Page 16
5.2 General CAE Requirements.  
Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL.

5.3 Material Requirement.  
**Generally:**  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.
