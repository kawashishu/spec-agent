9.3 Resistance to Media and Chemical Requirements.

9.3.1 Contamination.

9.3.2 Cleaning.  
Covered in DVPR.

9.3.3 Corrosion Protection.  

General requirements:  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosivity Low**: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium**: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High corrosivity**: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very high corrosivity**: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when located in wet locations.  

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. Direct contact with more noble metals such as steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness should be avoided. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.  

Electrical components must be installed to avoid vibrations that generate fretting corrosion.  

Terminals and connectors requirements:  
- Terminals should not be placed at the lowest points.  
- Corrosion protection relates to tightness; electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  

Groundings:  
Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in corrosive environments.  

Aluminium/sealing surfaces:  
Components using aluminium alloys with copper and iron content greater than 1% should be avoided for sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate seals quickly, allowing moisture entry.
Page 31
### Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass system and component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test. Additionally, functional testing must be conducted before and after the corrosion testing process.

**Component test for Metallic surfaces:**
- Salt spray test: ISO9227.

9.3.3 Corrosion Protection.  
Generally:  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosively position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. Corrosivity Low: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. Corrosivity Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. High corrosivity: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. Very high corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes—such as different types of control units—shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex), when in wet locations.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.  
Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners, etc., that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.  
The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  
Terminals, connectors: Do not place terminals on lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is first of all a requirement for tightness: Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  
Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be watertight if placed in a corrosive environment.  
Aluminum/sealing surfaces: Aluminum alloys with copper and iron content of >1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Reason: Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.  

Corrosion tests:  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  
Before and after corrosion testing, functional testing is to be carried out.  

- Component test for Metallic surfaces: Salt spray test: ISO 9227, acceptance criteria see below.  
- For Organic coatings: Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO 11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.

### VinFast Management System VFDSXVEEP9014

#### 9.4.2 End of Life Treatment 

**Dismantling Scheme:**  
The dismantling scheme describes the requirements to the contractor concerning the simple, unmixed dismantling of components and their accessibility during assembly. This dismantling scheme must be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

**Recycling Scheme:**  
This section outlines the general project-wide requirements for recycling and repair schemes during component development.  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
The contractor’s recycling scheme must outline a simple layout of the potential recycling process for the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimations. This recycling scheme must be submitted to the environmental experts team at VinFast before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

**Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:**  
To facilitate cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be integrated via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, in compliance with the following:  
- Enable sequential deployment of all components to avoid noise and pressure peaks and facilitate a check of deployment per component.
- After the deployment of pyrotechnical components, there must not be any solid combustion residues deemed as toxic waste or hazardous substances by current waste legislation. Otherwise, the components shall be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances.
- Deployment of pyrotechnical components must be successful and made immediately visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle or via feedback from the deployment tool). 
- Clear marking of pyrotechnical component positions, especially hidden components like battery safety terminal clamps and active safety headrests, is required.
- In cases of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is mandatory. Pre-dismantling should be avoided where technically possible to ensure accessibility of fasteners.
Page 34
9.4.3 Eco-Design.

Parts marking:  
Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations that have been defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<).

9.4.4 Lifecycle Analysis.

9.4.5 Emissions & Toxicology.

Harmful substances in components and materials:  
The emission behavior of the E/E product with direct contact to the interior compartment has to be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment have to be minimized accordingly. Required measurements for confirmation of the emission characteristics have to be done by the supplier in agreement with the specialist department of VinFast.  

The measurements have to be done at testing institutes approved by VinFast. It is recommended to obtain an overview of all approved testing institutes from VinFast. Additional requirements can be found in project-specific documents (e.g., Emission Guideline).  

Volatile organic compounds of components have to be checked according to ISO12219. The conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured through the complete product life cycle. The test result is evaluated by the specialist department of VinFast.  

In any case, the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health has to be attested in written form on demand. The supplier has to provide measurement results regarding VOC and Fogging for the materials before the milestone purchase release.

9.5 Mechanical Requirements.

9.5.1 Load.

Operating loads:  
Operating loads are the loads that occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast.  

The definition of customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.  

Special events:  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle (e.g., ABS-braking).  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.
Page 35
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, for example, curbstone impact. The vehicle must be dimensioned so that:

- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver, such as steering wheel inclined conditions or wheel inclined conditions.  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse, for example, easy replaceable parts before the body structure.  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations. Either to the same or at neighboring components (principle: deformation before break).  

**9.5.2 Vibration Behavior**  
The eigen frequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 30 Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VinFast. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in Chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.  

**9.5.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics**  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.  

**9.5.4 Deformation**  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.  

**9.5.5 Pressure**  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

9.5.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance

S&R, General 
Noises perceived as disturbing by customers must be eliminated through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier must ensure that components are free of disturbing noises in their vehicle environment and geometrical integration. This includes situations of vehicle and audio system excitation under all environmental conditions and throughout the fixed service life of the component. Squeak and rattle noises caused by body excitation (wind load, torsional flexing, etc.) must also be eliminated, even if real relative movements occur on the surface. This must be guaranteed across all operating and environmental conditions (temperature and humidity). To evidence freedom from disturbing noise, requirements should be coordinated with the responsible testing team.

The supplier is accountable for supporting the vibration and acoustic behavior development of subsystems within the complete vehicle environment and ensuring consistent acoustic quality of delivered parts. Responsibilities include actively addressing issues and proposing solutions. Necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation must be provided free of charge when requested.

9.6 Durability / Life Time

The lifetime mileage of the complete vehicle shall be at least 160,000 km, with a vehicle lifetime of at least 10 years (whichever comes first). 

Environmental operating conditions:  
- Ambient temperature: -40°C to +80°C  
- Relative humidity: 0 - 100%
