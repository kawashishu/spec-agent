Recycling:

Recycled Materials:  
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so called ‘proven recycling technologies’). Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclers and post-production recycles, e.g. recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert’s team at VINFAST.

Recycling Scheme:  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  

Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  

The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  

Recycling scheme has to be provided to environmental experts team at VINFAST before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

Corrosion Requirements Interior:  
- Screws, bolts on Handles, mirror.  
- Key.  
- Seat belts.  
- Trunk area.  
- Seat structure.  
- Invisible structural parts.  
- Vehicle tooling.  

Generally:  
For the determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosively position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

4. Very high corrosively:  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

Corrosion tests.  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

Component test for Metallic surfaces:  
- Fog test: ISO6270 CH, acceptance criteria see below.  
- Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.  

For Organic coatings:  
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.  
- Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.  

Test criteria:  

| **Area**                         | **Corrosivity**          | **Metallic coatings**          | **Organic coatings**          | **Pass criteria**               |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                      | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227          | 96 h → ISO6270 CH             | No red rust                    |
| Exterior                          | Medium                   | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227          | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust CCT: See below |
| High&not visible for customer; /  | High&visible             | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227      | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust CCT: See below |

Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:  
- Rust creep according to ISO4628-8: galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm, Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1-2 mm.  
- Blistering: Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  
- Edge corrosion: ≤ 10%.  
- Weld seam corrosion: ≤ 5%.  
- Degree of rusting: ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).  

The Interior is basically considered a dry area, meaning areas with low corrosively. Exceptions might be the floor area or areas where wetness/abrasion by shoes or drinking juices could produce corrosion.  
If combining different metals, avoid galvanic corrosion by coating such parts.  
Edges, especially painted edges, shall be burr-free for good edge coverage and avoiding wear.
Page 22
Seat structure, uncoated (blank steel): At least new parts must be corrosion-free. Further, the areas with corrosion risk must not be visible to the customer. Extreme positions of the seat-rests must be considered. On other invisible areas, the test criteria may also be lower than the above-mentioned, but it must be ensured that no corrosive products appear in visible areas, and the full function over the lifetime must be assured.

Vehicle tooling: Usually stored in the trunk, considered to have low corrosive exposure. For tool surfaces with wear, the corrosivity might be medium.

See also: Corrosion requirements on electric components.

### Test Plan
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done, and which testing devices are necessary. This plan shows the results in a good visual state and the progress of testing. Controlling of the test results must be ensured at all times. If VINFAST wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly during the testing phase, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The complete safeguarding of components is the responsibility of the SDS. Testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results within the committed schedule. The SDS must ensure that VINFAST receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VINFAST can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VINFAST and SDS.

Testing with wrong parts, missing parts, or different procedures must be redone at the cost of the SDS. In case of negative test results, tests must be re-planned, and retesting costs must be borne by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

### Data to Be Included in the DVP&R
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, or legal requirement.
- Description of devices used for testing and testing setup (with pictures).
- Identification of the responsible test department.
- Location of testing (internal/external).

The SDS is responsible for using the DVP&R template provided by the VINFAST testing department. The content of the DVP&R lies under the authority of the SDS.

The SDS must plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

In principle, the testing sequence and the number of test specimens must be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST.
Page 23
The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VINFAST departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department (VINFAST), SQA (VINFAST) and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule. Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.

### Testing  
#### General
