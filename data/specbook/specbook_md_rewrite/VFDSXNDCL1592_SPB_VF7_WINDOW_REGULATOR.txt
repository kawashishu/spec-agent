2 Specification summary.

**Technical Requirements Summary:**
Refer to DVP for Targets and acceptance criteria.

**Material:**
- Refer to IMDS document for: IMDS material data sheets have to be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID according to the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and VFDST00007601.
- Recycling & Recoverability – UN Regulation No. 133.
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances – Vietnam Law No. 06/2007/QH12.
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances – GADSL.
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances – California Proposition 65.
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances – Annex XIV, XVII of Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006.
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances – Annex II of Directive 2000/53/EC.

**Functional / Performance:**
Refer to VFDST00000013 – General Tolerances, drawings, DVP DVPRXNDCL1592, and SOR VFSRXNDCL1567 for functional requirements.  
- Working voltage: The regulator is connected to 9V, 11V, 13V, and 16V voltages respectively and runs for three working cycles for each voltage.  
- Current characteristic: At normal temperature in the 9-15V voltage range, the working current of the regulator motor must not be greater than 10A. When the motor stalls at normal temperature, the stall current must not be greater than 25A.  
- Stall torque: ≥170N.  
- Running speed: The running speed must be in the range of 70-200mm/s and the difference between the left and right running time must be less than 0.5s.  
- Self-locking performance: At the middle of the top edge of the glass (the glass is lowered 25mm at the highest position), apply a vertical downward force of 600N for not less than 5 seconds, then remove the load and measure the glass drop on the bracket.
