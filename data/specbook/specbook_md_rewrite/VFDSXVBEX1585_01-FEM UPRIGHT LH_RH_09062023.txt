Durability / Impact tests include sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800), vibration test combined with temperature (VFDST00062600), and corrosion test (NSS/Cyclic Corrosion) as per ISO 9227, ISO11997-B, and ISO 6270 CH.

Durability / Corrosion requirements are referenced under VFDSXXCVC4401. Key tests include fog test (ISO6270 CH), salt spray test (ISO9227), and cyclic corrosion test (ISO11997 Cycle B).

Safety and Security are evaluated through Thatcham guidelines.

Thermal and Aerodynamic assessments must meet PAT targets for aerodynamics and powertrain targets for air intake (thermal requirements).

Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is noted as "NO."

Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) specifications:
1. The acoustic and vibrational behavior must meet or surpass complete vehicle targets, equivalent or better than benchmark standards.
2. The system must operate acoustically unobtrusively under all work conditions, specifically avoiding rattling, squeaking, tone noise, whining, groaning, whistling, actuation noise, and grinding. Sound pressure levels and pitch modulations must remain stable.

Safety compliance requires adherence to FMVSS, NCAP, and ECE regulations.

Service manuals provide details on serviceability requirements.
