The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary.  
This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times.  

If VINFAST wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.  

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST.
Page 17
The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly during the testing phase or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of its component lies with the SDS. Testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on a committed schedule. The SDS must ensure that VINFAST receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VINFAST can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VINFAST and SDS.

If testing is conducted with incorrect parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, it must be redone at the SDS's expense. In case of negative test results, retesting must be re-planned and paid for by SDS, if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data must be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with a declaration of standard, norm, or legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing setup with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in the form of a project plan).
- Part variant and description of the part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible for using the DVP&R template provided by the VINFAST testing department. The content of the DVP&R is the responsibility of the SDS. The SDS must plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens must be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST. The test plan must be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VINFAST departments and the SDS. The DVP&R must be agreed upon between the test department SQA (VINFAST) and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS must deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS must draw up a test plan for each single component.

### Testing

#### General
The SDS prepares a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.16). 

It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested. 

To prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests must be combined as far as possible. 

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS must be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered by the SDS from VINFAST.
Page 18
Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for only its component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VINFAST requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VINFAST.

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved.

All tests must be documented according to VINFAST standard, alternatively to SDS standard, if this is accepted by VINFAST.

The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification.

The tests have to be brought in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.

Samples for sample inspections to be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (in coordination with the test department). 

VINFAST “Logistics” determines the number of sample parts, VINFAST “Purchase” orders the parts.

A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS.

### Release by Test-Departments

The responsible VINFAST test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved from the SDS and during the complete vehicle integration tests.

The SDS must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any problems (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the SDS must submit a test report, must be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions (to keep all milestones, to observe all targets, etc.).

OK or NOK results need to be stated on the first sheet of the report.

### Analyses, Test-Reports

The SDS has to provide measurement reports according to VINFAST specification (VFDST00008900) [43] in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts.

After the individual tests, the test samples have to be analyzed in detail.

The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report has to be handed over to the responsible VINFAST department for release. 

Upon request, the results together with the documentation of the tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development) are to be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests carried out parallel to series production are to be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.
Page 19
Test-report/-information:
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (part no., change index, materials, production process, additives like grease, and every deviation from approved serial process).
- All parts have to be labeled with a description.
- The reason for testing (if applicable), such as negative test results, along with attachment of earlier test reports.
- Testing with exact naming of testing standard, norm, legal requirement, or exact description of agreed testing procedure.

Documentation of Result:
- Short description of the result (pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of result OK/NOK, pictures of the parts in testing position, etc.).
- Comparison with targets from the specification book, testing specification, or legal requirements.
- Recommendations.
- Description of corrective measures or further approach in case of negative test result.
- Progress of testing status.
- Listing of all tests in a table with responsible person, part status, comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the SDS must provide a new date for re-testing with countermeasures for VINFAST approval, including responsible person and company to perform the test.

Archival Storage of Tested Parts:
Testing parts are only allowed to be scrapped if VINFAST test department agrees to this action. Upon request of the test engineer, the complete testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.

BIW-Supports, Testing Devices, and Equipment:
The number and configuration must be aligned with the testing department. BIW supports are provided by VINFAST for the testing period. 
The number and structures for testing (vibration testing device, devices for environmental testing, and long-term run structures) must be aligned with the test department. 
The evidence that all equipment for testing complies with corresponding testing instructions must be proven by SDS.

At least the following details need to be documented for all test samples and included in testing reports:
- Drawing Number.
- Part Number.
- Release Number.
Page 20
 Change Index.
 Production- and Delivery Date.
 Documentation and designation according to VINFAST specification VFDST00008700 [41].
 Documentation of the tool revision state.
 Measurement Report.
 DSR Development Sample Report VINFAST specification VFDST00008800 [42].

Virtual testing.

Suitable calculation methods are to be used and adequately detailed calculation models created by the SDS for the purpose of securing, verifying, and effectively optimizing the component properties defined in the technical specification, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations. The requirements related to the mechanical properties of the component, such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, are to be secured by means of FEM calculations.

The tool-dimensioning for the injection molding is to be optimized by corresponding simulations. On request, the operative calculation models that represent the respective development status are to be made available at any time to the requesting technical departments of VINFAST for internal calculations and integration work.

The SDS must provide suitable FEM models upon request from VINFAST, without extra cost. The tests done by the SDS according to the evaluation plan must be calculative and documented (e.g., FEM) before the tool dimensioning.

Basically, no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range is allowed. In particular, by the use of materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients, the behavior has to be maintained.

The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.

These component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP must be agreed upon between VINFAST and the SDS and will be binding.

If VINFAST orders parts for testing, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.

Parts needed for testing activities at the VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

Geometrical Integration.

RPS (Reference Position System): The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. An RPS-concept for the design has to be completed with quality assurance during the SE-process. The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen according to the RPS-system VFDST00000011 [34], with alignment to the interior and BIW-department.
Page 21
Tolerance analyses: Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms.
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.

Arrangements are necessary in order to ensure the required gap dimension of components.

Clearance Wiring Harness: A clearance of min. 8mm to the wiring harness is needed. Shape and position tolerances [15] and general tolerances [16] have to be considered.
