5.1.1 System description.  
A Chiller is a heat exchanger designed to absorb heat from the hot oil of the battery, supporting the battery cooling process. It is a plate heat exchanger with provisions for the movement of both fluids (refrigerant to oil) during heat exchange. The battery coolant exchanges heat with the refrigerant in the AC circuit. The Chiller becomes essential when the Radiator alone cannot sufficiently cool down the Battery.  

The required chiller will include:  
- Laminated heat exchanger.  
- Thermal expansion valve (TXV).  
- Solenoid valve (if possible).  

The objective is to reduce complexity while achieving high commonality. The intention is to utilize off-the-shelf products to minimize development timelines. Suppliers are expected to submit portfolios of off-the-shelf components that meet VinFast requirements in advance.  

5.1.2 Package layout overview.  
The complete vehicle is still under development. Suppliers are to use the provided dimensions as references to confirm technical feasibility and provide initial quotations. More accurate dimensions/envelops will be issued as they are finalized.  

The system designer must ensure that all components of the module are integrated with respect to packaging, functionality, fixing, and tolerances.  

The outlined dimensions are based on the BEV layout and are designed to encourage compactness and cost-efficiency. Suppliers are responsible for presenting the most cost-effective alternatives for each variant, ensuring acceptable quality standards while considering overall low cost.
Page 10
5.1.3 Function. The chiller is subjected to:

1. Heat exchange: Refrigerant side inlet pressure on the refrigerant side (1.68±0.01) Mpa; subcooling (5±1) °C; refrigerant side outlet pressure (0.29±0.003) Mpa. Hot side: inlet temperature of coolant (35±1) °C; coolant flow rate: 10 l/min; heat exchange ≥ 4k (Refrigerant for test: R134A).

2. Refrigerant leakage rate: Under the pressure of 0.8 Mpa (surface pressure), the annual leakage rate of evaporator refrigerant is less than 3g/yr.

3. Air tightness: The chiller (lower pressure) shall be able to withstand the pressure of P air tightness = 1.5 Mpa and maintain the constant pressure T air tightness = 3 min without leakage (test medium: water).

4. Pressure resistance: The chiller (lower pressure) shall be able to withstand P pressure = 1.7 Mpa and maintain constant pressure T pressure = 3 min with no leakage and visible deformation (test medium: water).

5.1.4 System Requirements. 

System supplier has to define characteristic curve/values matching thermal and electrical requirements from HVAC and battery.

The BEV cooling system will have coolant for battery cooling, which is required to be cooled in the chiller. Chiller selection will be based on coolant type and characteristics.

The following requirements must be fulfilled:

- Geometry.
- Acoustics, vibrations, resonances.
- Life due to the operational profile.
- Service and ease of repair.

5. **Description and Scope of Work**  

5.1 **Technical requirement**  
This specification establishes the technical cooling module requirements for the BEV Chiller.  

- VinFast must be able to audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specifications.  
- The system developer is required to develop technical solutions and requirements based on available vehicle and design data within the design process to achieve the project’s goals.  
- Technical and commercial releases will be processed by the customer according to change management procedures.  

The aim is to deliver a validated chiller for BEV variants to support HVAC and battery thermal requirements. The chiller is a critical component for battery cooling in BEV vehicles.

5.1.1 **System description**  
The chiller is a heat exchanger designed to absorb heat from hot oil in the battery, aiding in battery cooling. It is a plate heat exchanger where battery coolant exchanges heat with refrigerant in the AC circuit. The chiller is particularly useful when the radiator cannot cool the battery effectively.  

Required chiller features:  

- Laminated heat exchanger.  
- Thermal expansion valve (TXV).  
- Solenoid valve (if applicable).  

The objective is to minimize complexity while maintaining high commonality using off-the-shelf components. Suppliers are expected to provide a portfolio compatible with VinFast requirements.  

---

5.1.2 **Package layout overview**  
The complete vehicle is under development, and dimensions provided should be used as references to confirm technical feasibility and provide initial quotations. Updated dimensions will be supplied later.  

System designers must coordinate all module components concerning packaging, functionality, fixing, and tolerances.  

Goals:  

- Designs should be compact, cost-effective, and meet acceptable quality levels.  
- Suppliers are responsible for confirming cost-effective alternatives per variant.  

---

5.1.3 **Function**  
The chiller performs the following tasks:  

- Heat exchange occurs between refrigerant and oil, optimizing battery cooling.  
- Ensures geometry, acoustic performance, lifespan based on operational profiles, ease of service, and repair.  

---

5.1.4 **System requirements**  
Chiller suppliers must define characteristic curves/values matching thermal and electrical requirements from HVAC and battery systems. Specific requirements include:  

- Geometry.  
- Acoustic performance, vibrations, and resonances.  
- Longevity in varied operational scenarios.  
- Compatibility with service protocols.  

**Characteristic Curves:** Suppliers must provide detailed charts for chiller samples.  

---

5.1.5 **Interfaces**  
Major interface points to ensure functionality:  

- AC Lines.  
- Electrical connections.

- BIW (clearances, packaging, resonances, stiffness).  
- Traction battery.  
- Chassis components (e.g., cooling system, electric system, piping).  
- Performance compatibility at the vehicle level.  

The chiller module must function within temperature variations (-30°C to 40°C), corrosive environments, and road load conditions. Interfaces, especially mounting and fixation, directly influence chiller positioning and clearances, while other interfaces ensure durability, dynamic behavior, and tolerance management.  

---
