4 General Project Guidelines.

4.1 Development Scope Abstract.
This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the DMS Camera. The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics. The Contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements. 

Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production or validation details, have to be reported immediately. The contractor is a ‘Full-Service Supplier,’ with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

4.2 Initial Situation and Objective.
The DMS camera is a new development component for VF. Through the implementation of testing and vehicle performance verification, the goal is to meet the performance design requirements of the ADAS.
Page 9
The system is planned for use in various vehicle models, for various country-specific packages, and for various combinations of optional equipment. Adaptation of system functions to a given vehicle shall be accomplished by modular component population of the necessary modules and coding via the diagnostics interface.

### 4.3 Classification of the System / Component.
There is only one DMS camera variant.

### 4.4 Execution Regulations.
The DMS is developed to meet the regulation requirements for EU homologation and Euro NCAP. The targets are listed below:

| Features                | Regulation/Standards/NCAP                                                                                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Distraction             | Advanced Driver Distraction Warning (ADDW – EC 2023/2590), Euro NCAP 2023                           |
| Drowsiness              | Driver Drowsiness and Attention Warning (DDAW – EC 2021/1341)                                       |
| Fatigue (Drowsiness,    | Euro NCAP 2023                                                                                     |
| microsleep, sleep)      |                                                                                                    |

### 4.5 Duty to Notify Vinfast of a Non-Compliance with Regulations.
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with a regulation or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The Supplier has a duty to notify Vinfast on such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

### 4.6 Development and Supply Scope.
The supplier status is "Full Service Supplier," which means that the supplier has the complete responsibility of the supplied system within the system boundaries.

This responsibility includes:
- Define, develop, 3D-design all parts within the system.
- Create release drawings.
- Ensure the function of the system.
- Perform any required simulations or calculations on the system level.
- Validate the system according to the technical targets and tests stated in this specification.
- System timing (in terms of project management, development, and industrialization).

The agreed work-share is documented in the section “Work Interface Chart” (RASI).

#### 4.6.1 Work Interface Chart (RASI).
Work Interface Chart (RASI).  
The main supplier obligations are described in the work interface chart (RASI).  
The status of the supplier (“Built to Print” or “System Development Supplier”) is defined below the System / Component Specification.

4.11 Type Approval and Certification.

VinFast is responsible for the integration and certification of the vehicle grade system. Vehicle-level certification projects include urban simulation road tests and enhanced road tests. Suppliers of spare parts/subsystems will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found in the process of integration and certification of vehicle-level systems. All countermeasures to resolve issues addressed in the failure report must be executed by the supplier and approved by PPAP.

The integration and certification of components/subsystems is the responsibility of the supplier of components/subsystems. The supplier must complete all parts/subsystems tests.

The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or by the supplier appointing a lower supplier or a third party after VinFast approval.

However, in any case, the supplier is obliged to complete all specified test requirements. The supplier of parts/subsystems must provide the VinFast Product Release Engineer with a complete test certification plan for parts/subsystems and obtain the approval of the Engineer. The plan should include at least the number of specimens, test sequence, place, and time of each test.

4.12 Quality and Reliability.

4.12.1 Quality Concepts.
Supplier must satisfy the quality commitment made to VinFast, that is, to guarantee 100 waste products per 1,000,000 pieces of spare parts sent to VinFast. PPM 100%, CPK 1.33.

4.12.2 Risk Management.
The supplier shall notify the VinFast Product Release Engineer in writing of any potential technical matters, such as problems, accidents, latest information, project changes, etc., which may lead to increased costs, delays in project nodes and plans, and delays in delivery dates. The supplier written notice should include a specific repair plan and a risk assessment and description of the overall project schedule.
Page 14
### Validation of the SW Development  
The supplier shall regularly report to VinFast the relevant design input factors and provide engineering support. At the same time, suppliers should attend supplier development meetings and complete necessary design validation.  

If there are inconsistencies with the specified specification requirements, the supplier should work with VinFast to solve the problem. Suppliers also need to provide VinFast with competent on-site service personnel to support VinFast in resolving problems associated with supplier parts in vehicle assembly during the vehicle start-up phase.  

### Material Requirement  
- **Prohibited or Restricted Substances, Emissions & Toxicology**:  
  The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification must be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelve parts and spare parts by the supplier through the complete product life cycle according to VFDST00007601.  
  IMDS material data sheets must be submitted into VinFast IMDS ID according to the official VinFast IMDS Guideline (Testing & Validation) and VFDST00007601.  
  Specific targets on vehicle indoor air quality must conform to:  
  VFDSXVCVC3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline.  
  Material details such as weight, grade, and density must also be defined.  

### Content Amendments  
The supplier shall notify the VinFast Product Release Engineer in writing of any potential technical matters, such as problems, accidents, latest information, project changes, etc., which may lead to increased costs, delays in project nodes and plans, and delays in delivery dates. The supplier written notice should include a specific repair plan and a risk assessment and description of the overall project schedule.
