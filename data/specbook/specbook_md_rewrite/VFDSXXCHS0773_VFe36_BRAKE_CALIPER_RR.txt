**RS-656WA Motor Performance Chart Description**

Figure depicts the performance characteristics of the RS-656WA motor under various voltage conditions (12V, 9V, and 13.5V). It visually presents the relationships between efficiency, output, current, speed, and torque. Key data from the chart indicates:

1. Motor efficiency increases steadily until peak torque and decreases beyond this point.
2. Speed declines as torque increases across all voltage scenarios, with 13.5V providing higher performance curves compared to the lower voltage ranges.
3. Current consumption rises with an increase in torque.
4. The graph is marked with specific numerical reference points for motor operation at different torque settings.

This allows comparisons of performance for varying conditions and serves as a tool for optimizing the operational efficiency of the RS-656WA motor system.

6 Supplier responsibilities  
Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier Responsibilities are itemised to help mitigate the risk to the organisation of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.  

### Customer service requirements  

#### After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

#### Spare Parts Support Cycle  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need ensure life cycles of project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.  

#### Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).
