3 Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions.

Mounting clearance standard: comply with UNECE R55 released 15.6.2018.

The diagram illustrates the mounting clearance requirements, including specific measurements and angles for coupling point clearances and vertical planes at vehicle limits. Key highlights include:

- Clearance space designed at an angle of 45° and 65°, ensuring sufficient space for coupling mechanisms.
- Maximum coupling clearance values detailed, such as:
  - 15° maximum vertical clearance angle.
  - 100 mm maximum horizontal clearance.
- Vertical plane dimensions are detailed, ensuring compliance with the UNECE R55 standards (released on 15.6.2018).
- Additional measurements include a minimum distance of 140 mm from ground clearance and radii limit values (e.g., R 14.5 mm).
- Compliance requirements reference specific UNECE R55 sections, such as Annex 7, 350 para 1.1.1.

This ensures the specifications meet legal and safety standards for proper installation and function.
