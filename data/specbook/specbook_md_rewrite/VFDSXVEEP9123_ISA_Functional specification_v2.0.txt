6.4.1 / / Intelligent Speed Limit Control system (ISLC) ISLC  

Requirement ID: FS-226293  
Type: --  
Status: New  

**Description:**  
The ISLC function combines the ISA function and ACC function. The speed limit information is provided by the navigation system or camera. If the difference between the speed limit information and the cruise speed set by the current dashboard is more than the threshold value (which can be calibrated), the system will confirm with the driver whether to update the speed limit as the new ACC target cruise speed.

Status: New  

**Configuration details:**  
1) For VF35 ICE and VF36 ICE: Only use the front camera to detect speed limit signs.  
2) For VFe35 BEV and VFe36 BEV: Combine front camera detection and navigation system information for ISA function in Europe, while in other regions keep consistent with the ICE variant.

#### 6.4.1 / Intelligent Speed Limit Control system (ISLC) ISLC.  

**Requirement ID:** FS-226293.  
**Type:** --.  
**Status:** New.  

The ISLC function combines the ISA function and ACC function. The speed limit information is provided by the navigation system or a camera. If the difference between the speed limit information and the cruise speed set by the current dashboard is more than the threshold value (which can be calibrated), the system will confirm with the driver whether to update the speed limit as the new ACC target cruise speed.  

---

#### 6.4.2 / Function Configuration and Disclaimer.  

**Requirement ID:** FS-226294.  
**Type:** --.  
**Status:** New.  

Function configuration is defined as below:  
1. For VF35 ICE and VF36 ICE: Only use the front camera to detect speed limit signs.  
2. For VFe35 BEV and VFe36 BEV: Combine front camera detection and navigation system information for ISA function in Europe, while in other regions keep consistent with ICE variants.  

Note that this function is only an assistance function and is designed to help drivers maintain a speed below the recommended speed limit. It is not designed to replace driver observation of traffic signs or adherence to traffic rules.  

It is recommended that the OEM deploying such functions make it clear to the driver either via a disclaimer on the vehicle HMI or in the vehicle user manual.

### 6.5 / Function Architecture.  

**Requirement ID:** FS-226295.  
**Type:** --.  
**Status:** New.  

The system architecture is composed of Speed Limit Value Fusion (Camera), ACC Module, HMI Module, Radar Object Detection, Vehicle CAN integration, Navigation system, MP5/SCC, and Dashboard for output. Vehicle inputs include map information, vehicle dynamics, icons, and buttons for operation.

Requirement ID: FS-226293.  
Type: --  
Status: New.  

ISLC function combines the ISA function and ACC function. The speed limit information is provided by navigation system or camera. If the difference between the speed limit information and the cruise speed set by the current dashboard is more than the threshold value (which can be calibrated), the system will confirm with the driver whether to update the speed limit as the new ACC target cruise speed.  

6.4.2 / / Function configuration and Disclaimer.  

Requirement ID: FS-226294.  
Type: --  
Status: New.  

Function configuration is defined as below:  
1. For VF35 ICE and VF36 ICE: Only use the front camera to detect speed limit signs.  
2. For VFe35 BEV and VFe36 BEV: Combine front camera detection and navigation system information for ISA function in Europe, while in other regions, keep consistent with ICE variants.  

Note: This function is only an assistance function designed to help drivers maintain a speed below the recommended speed limit. It is not meant to replace the driver observing the traffic signs and obeying the traffic rules for the environment they are driving in.

6.8.1 / / Condition of speed adjustment.  
Requirement ID: FS-226321.  
Type: --.  
Status: New.  

When the difference between perceived speed limit value and host current speedometer speed is larger than the offset configured in MHU (see section 8.2), ISLC shall set the perceived speed limit as new target cruise speed and adjust the current host speed by either acceleration or deceleration. (Only when the perceived speed limit is lower than display speed limit, ISLC will set the target cruise speed.)  

When the perceived speed limit has been cancelled, ISLC function (along with ACC function) will keep using the same target cruise speed as before.  

In order to fulfil GSR, speed offset configuration shall only be available when vehicle region code is not Europe. Then MHU shall inhibit relevant configurations in display menu, and signals 0x126.ADS_ISA_SpeedLimitCon_Percent and 0x126.ADS_ISA_Speed_Setting shall always be 0 “no offset."

ISLC system speed limit value comes from camera and navigation system. The speed limit value from the camera has higher priority than the speed limit from the navigation system.

Requirement ID: FS-226334.

Status: New.

On receiving 0x3F7.MFS_ISAControl == 1 or 2, ISLC function shall send out 0x353.ADAS_ISA_Btn_Feed and 0x353.ADAS_ISA_Mode_SW_Feed with:
- 0 Off, if ISLC internal state cannot change to Active.
- 1 On, if ISLC internal state has changed to Active.

6.9.2 / / MHU Offset Configuration MHU.

Requirement ID: FS-226335. 
Type: --. 
Status: New.
Page 22
ISLC function shall send out 0x134. ADAS_ISA_SpeedLimitCon_Percent consistent with the received value of signal 0x126. ADAS_ISA_SpeedLimitCnt_Per_Feed.

On receiving 0x126. ADAS_ISA_SpeedLimitCon_Percent as “5 Percent,” “10 Percent,” or “15 Percent,” ISLC shall set a new target cruise speed with the perceived speed limit only when:
- Abs((current speed - perceived speed limit) / current speed) >= ADAS_ISA_SpeedLimitCon_Percent.

ISLC function shall send out 0x134.ADAS_ISA_SpeedLimitCnt_Spd_Feed consistent with the received value of signal 0x126. ADAS_ISA_Speed_Setting.

On receiving 0x126. ADAS_ISA_Speed_Setting as “5 kph,” “10 kph,” “15 kph,” “20 kph,” “5 mph,” “10 mph,” or “15 mph,” ISLC shall set a new target cruise speed with the perceived speed limit only when:
- Abs(current speed - perceived speed limit) >= ADAS_ISA_SpeedLimitCnt_Spd_Feed.

Note: 
- The new target cruise speed will be sent out through 0x353. ADAS_ACC_TagSpeed. Its related requirements refer to the ACC function specification.
- When there is an offset that is not an integer, the floor function should be used (e.g., 60.5 as 60).

Driver’s adjustment of ACC/ISLC target cruise speed shall always have a higher priority than the perceived speed limit. [Refer to GSR: "It shall not affect the possibility, for the drivers, of exceeding the system‘s prompted vehicle speed."]

1. If the ISLC function is on (0x353.ADAS_ISA_Btn_Feed == 1) and the perceived speed limit is received during the driver adjusting ACC/ISLC target cruise speed (e.g., through SPEED+/- or SET button), this perceived speed limit shall be ignored.

2. If the ISLC function is on (0x353.ADAS_ISA_Btn_Feed == 1) and the perceived speed limit is received but within the range restricted by MHU offset settings, this perceived speed limit shall be ignored. Later, the driver can manually adjust the ACC/ISLC target cruise speed (e.g., through SPEED+/- or SET button) as usual.

3. If the ISLC function is off (0x353.ADAS_ISA_Btn_Feed == 2) and the perceived speed limit is received during the driver adjusting ACC/ISLC target cruise speed (e.g., through SPEED+/- or SET button), ISLC recommendations shall also be sent out (see popup message in section 8.3.2).

MHU shall avoid sending out valid signal values simultaneously for 0x134.ADAS_ISA_SpeedLimitCnt_Spd and 0x126.ADAS_ISA_SpeedLimitCon_Percent. 

Suppose valid signal values are received simultaneously for 0x134.ADAS_ISA_SpeedLimitCnt_Spd and 0x126.ADAS_ISA_SpeedLimitCon_Percent. In that case, 0x134.ADAS_ISA_SpeedLimitCnt_Spd_Feed shall be used with a higher priority.

For speed limit signs ended with 5 (e.g., 15/25/35/45/55), detection performance refers to actual test results.  
ISA duplicate.

6.10.13 / Speed Limit Accuracy.

Requirement ID: FS-198320.  
Type: --  
Status: New.  

Speed Limit Accuracy: ≥95% Map information required.

6.10.14 / Multi-lane Speed Limit Sign.

Requirement ID: FS-198321.  
Type: --  
Status: New.  

System shall detect multi-lane speed limit signs, but only display the speed limit information of the lane that the host vehicle is traveling on. This depended on Fusion and camera systems. Maps do not provide the information.  
ISA 9/12] duongvh3, should rely on Camera only not ISA Maps. Maps does not provide the information.
