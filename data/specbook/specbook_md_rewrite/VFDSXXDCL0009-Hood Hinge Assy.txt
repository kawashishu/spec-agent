#### 3.2 Technical Requirement
Refer to VinFast "Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements."

The quality strategy for VinFast vehicles aims for zero defects during the average product lifetime at delivery and operation by the customer. To achieve this, all associated development and manufacturing processes must be optimized to avoid defects and ensure reliability.

Key requirements include:
- Development planning should observe quality assurance as per customer requirements, including purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistical specifications.
- Processes for minimizing development and manufacturing risks are defined in the Activity Interface Agreement attached to the development contract.

**Functional and durability standards for components and assemblies:**
- The system/component must maintain full functionality for at least 10 years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.
- Designed for high-volume production.
- Maintenance-free throughout the vehicle's lifetime.
- Emit no disturbing noises.
- Remain fully functional after 15,000 open-close cycles.
- Utilize standard and commonly available parts where feasible and reasonable.

**Additional Requirements:**
Refer to Part 1: General Engineering Requirements VinFast.
Page 7
3.2.1 Certification  
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to VINFAST requirements, and the parts provided by the supplier must meet these requirements and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing. Component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found during vehicle-level system integration and certification. All changes caused by failure reporting must be performed by the vendor and approved via the PPAP process.  
- Component/subsystem integration and certification are the responsibility of the component/subsystem supplier, who must complete all component/subsystem tests.  
- The certification of parts/subsystems can be implemented by the supplier of parts/subsystems or, after VINFAST approval, designated sub-suppliers or third parties.  
- In any event, the supplier is obligated to complete all specified test requirements.  
- The component/subsystem supplier must provide VINFAST's product release engineer with a complete component/subsystem test certification plan approved by the engineer. The plan shall include at least the number of samples, test sequence, place, and time of each test.  

3.2.2 General Description of the System / Component  
It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification. Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers based on this specification must be agreed upon between the department creating the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.  

The system developer commits to developing all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process to achieve system-specific requirements.  

The fulfillment of all laws and ratings of system markets must be ensured. No modifiers are permitted for rating assessments. Technical proposals exceeding the offered development scope must include an identification of impacts on costs, quality, and schedule.  

Technical and commercial releases are processed by VINFAST according to change management.  

Passive safety requirements must comply with all laws of system markets with fixed release dates at the time of homologation on the Class B and C common platform. VINFAST will monitor ongoing rating protocol changes to ensure vehicle target achievement at SOP.  

The supplier delivers the system as a module, including all relevant add-on parts.  

For release documentation, the following sheets and documents are necessary:  
- Drawings  
- Simulations  
- Quality regulations  
- Results/documentation of test validation  
- Documentation of the FMEA  
- All parts of the assembly must be matched to each other.

6 Supplier responsibilities.

Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier Responsibilities are itemised to help mitigate the risk to the organisation of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

Customer service requirements:
- After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.  
  The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  
- Spare Parts Support Cycle.  
  The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need ensure life cycles of project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.  
- Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.  
  The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).
