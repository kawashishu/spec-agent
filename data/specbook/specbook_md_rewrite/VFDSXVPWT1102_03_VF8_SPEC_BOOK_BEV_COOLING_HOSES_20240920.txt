3 Additional Technical or Functional descriptions.

New cooling hoses need to be developed and added sleeve due to below-mentioned reasons:
- Jonhon connector introduced by EE as BCO proposal and its causing less clearance and touching issue in Jonhon connector and cooling hoses.
- QE team feedback for touching condition in cooling hoses.
