### 4.3.1 / / ACC Function Introduction ACC.  

Requirement ID: FS-226006.  
Type: --.  
Status: Submitted.  

Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a driver assistance system that supports drivers to guarantee a safe and comfortable stop-and-go driving experience with full deceleration capabilities by automatically controlling the brake and throttle. As a driver assistance system, this feature maintains a clearance to a forward vehicle or maintains the set speed, whichever speed is lower.  

The feature is also able to reduce the vehicle's speed in front of and during curves to be able to take the curve at a safe and comfortable speed. When the vehicle has reached a stop due to the vehicle in front being stopped as well, the driver needs to manually confirm continuation after a stop of 3 seconds or more.  

At the first ignition cycle ONLY, the vehicle needs to reach an operation speed of 20 kph or higher to activate the ACC function.  

After the first ACC activation, if the driver deactivates ACC using the Cancel button or presses and releases the brake pedal, ACC can be reactivated using the Resume button. This is allowed at any speed with or without a leading vehicle as long as the driver confirms.  

For ACC Stop & Go:
- The ACC system can come to a complete stop and automatically resume from 0 kph without driver confirmation if within 3 seconds.  
- If the vehicle is stopped between 3 seconds and 5 minutes, the driver can resume using the Resume button or tap on the gas pedal.  
- If the holding time exceeds 5 minutes, the electronic parking brake will apply. The driver must release the electronic parking brake or press the gas to release the parking brake, after which ACC can be reactivated.  

Due to sensor limitations:
- If ACC operates at speeds above 60 kph, it cannot detect or stop for a stationary vehicle. The driver must remain vigilant at all times and take control as necessary.  

If ACC is degraded due to limited front visibility (e.g., camera obstruction), ACC Stop & Go functionality will not be available, and activation speed will be limited to 20 kph or higher. The driver must pay attention and supervise the system.  

The system requires driver supervision under all conditions, as the driver retains control of longitudinal and steering dynamics. The adaptive cruise control is not a collision avoidance system, and intervention is required if the system does not detect a vehicle in front.  

Limitations of the system:  
- ACC does not brake for pedestrians, animals, small vehicles such as bicycles, or certain motorcycle types. It also does not detect oncoming, slow, or stationary vehicles.

Status: New.

4.3.1 / / ACC Function Introduction ACC.  

Requirement ID:  
FS-226006.  
Type: --  
Status: Submitted.

The ACC Function Introduction outlines the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) as a driver assistance system designed to ensure safe and comfortable stop-and-go driving. It automatically controls the throttle and brakes, maintaining distance from a forward vehicle or the set speed, whichever is lower. Key functions include adjustment of vehicle speed to safely navigate curves and dynamic management of stopping and resuming.  

Additional details:  
- Activation speed: 20kph or higher during the first ignition cycle.  
- Reactivation possible via Resume button or tapping the gas pedal.   
- Operation limitations: ACC detects stationary vehicles only below 60kph, does not avoid small objects, pedestrians, or certain motorcycles, and is not suitable for slippery or congested roads.  
- Driver supervision required for steering control and timely intervention as ACC is not a collision avoidance system.

4.3.1.1 / / Cruise Control Mode.  

Requirement ID:  
FS-226007.  
Type: --  
Status: New.  

Cruise Control Mode serves as the basic ACC function, maintaining speed in the absence of an impeding vehicle. It dynamically adjusts powertrain or braking systems based on user-defined speeds while allowing inputs such as speed changes and pedal override from the driver. ACC calculates potential lane changes to ensure safe and seamless lane transitions.

4.3.1.2 / / Follow Mode.  

Requirement ID:  
FS-226008.  
Type: --  
Status: New.  

Follow Mode activates when ACC detects a slower preceding vehicle, and dynamically regulates speed relative to the distance and movement of the detected object. It ensures safe following while accommodating speed variations based on the impeding vehicle’s behavior.
Page 13
At the same time, if the vehicle in the front side lane cuts into the lane, ACC system will send a deceleration request. ACC reacts to Driver input of the desired headway (time gap) and accelerator/brake pedal overrides in follow mode.

### 4.3.1.3 / / Bend Limit Mode

**Requirement ID:** FS-226009  
**Type:** --  
**Status:** New  

Bend limit mode limits the acceleration of the host vehicle in bends according to the lateral acceleration, yaw rate, and driving speed for safety and comfort reasons. ACC can take the initiative to slow down in the corner. The deceleration value depends on the vehicle lateral acceleration (refer to the following table, could be calibrated). This aims at safe driving in the corner.

| Vehicle speed (m/s) | Lateral acceleration (m/s²) | Deceleration values (m/s²) |

### 4.3.1.4 / / Overtaking Mode

**Requirement ID:** FS-226010  
**Type:** --  
**Status:** New  

When following an impeding vehicle, ACC detects the overtaking intention of the driver when the indicator/turn signal on the left is set. ACC then starts accelerating and reducing the distance to the impeding vehicle below the desired time headway setting. When the driver changes the lane, ACC accelerates to the ACC set speed.

**Note:**  
This sub-function shall be configured according to customer requirement, and it is not enabled by default.
Page 14
In VinFast project, this feature shall be enabled.

4.3.2 / / ACC Function Variants ACC.

4.3.2.1 / / ACC S&G.

Requirement ID: FS-226012. Type: --. Status: New.

ACC S&G (Stop & Go) means the ACC function manages the vehicle's longitudinal dynamics from its activation by Driver during a cruise (unless a deactivation is requested by Driver or road/system conditions). ACC S&G variant must be equipped on a vehicle with an automotive transmission gearbox and an advanced ESC unit.

4.3.3 / / ACC.

Requirement ID: FS-226013. Type: --. Status: New.

ACC From the vehicle level overview, ACC is a function that requires multi-ECUs involved. In this system, radar or camera provides target vehicle information as a sensor, then core ACC control algorithm needs to be integrated inside. Here OEMs need to realize, discussing signal interfaces, determining functional schemes, and distributing the algorithm modules required to ECUs is necessary before the project is officially developed. System architecture can be divided as the following options:

Since different actuators are chosen in different VinFast project variants, interfaces will be different:
- ICE variant will be developed based on deceleration demands to ESC and wheel torque demands to EMS.
- BEV variant will be developed based on acceleration and deceleration demands to IDB.
Page 15
4.3.3.1 ICE-Deceleration & Wheel torque interface. Requirement ID: FS-226014. Type: --. Status: New.  
In ICE variant, the ADAS ECU requests deceleration setpoint values to ESC and requests wheel torque to Powertrain. Gearshift logic is handled by the powertrain system.  

4.3.3.2 BEV-Deceleration & Wheel torque interface. Requirement ID: FS-226015. Type: --. Status: New.  
In BEV variant, the ADAS ECU requests acceleration/deceleration setpoint values to IDB. IDB handles driving torque control and deceleration control while requesting wheel torque to Powertrain. Other features like regenerative braking and gear shifting are not handled by ADAS ECU.

Type: --  
Status: New  

---

4.7.1 Cruise Control Mode  

Requirement ID: FS-226136  
Type: --  
Status: New
Page 72
Cruise Control mode is the basic function of ACC. This mode means when there is no impeding vehicle detected by the system tracking algorithm or the preceding vehicle is faster than the ACC speed.  
In cruise mode, ACC adjusts the powertrain or braking system depending on the set speed given by the driver.  
ACC reacts to driver inputs in cruise mode, accommodating set speed changes and accelerator pedal overrides.

4.7.2 / / Follow Mode

Requirement ID: FS-226137  
Type: --  
Status: New
Page 73
Follow mode is active when the system detects an impeding preceding vehicle driving at a speed lower than the ACC set speed.

In follow mode:
- ACC adjusts the driving speed based on the relative distance, relative speed of the target vehicle, and target acceleration.
- ACC responds to driver inputs for desired headway (time gap) and the accelerator or brake pedal overrides.

4.7.3 / / Intelligent Curving Mode.

Requirement ID: FS-226138  
Type: --  
Status: New  

The Intelligent Curving Mode is designed to enhance vehicle safety and comfort while navigating curves.

- The mode anticipates and decelerates according to the radius of curvature and lane width, using lane information sourced from the camera.  
- Upon exiting the curve, the system accelerates to the set speed, defining the appropriate set speed based on road conditions.  
- Bend limit mode restricts host vehicle acceleration in bends, factoring lateral acceleration, yaw rate, and driving speed.
Page 74
4.7.4 / / Overtaking Mode.

Requirement ID: FS-226139.  
Type: --  
Status: New.  

When following an impeding vehicle, ACC detects the overtaking intention of the Driver when the corresponding indicator or turn signal on the left is set. ACC then starts accelerating and reducing the distance to the impeding vehicle below the desired time headway setting. When the Driver changes the lane, ACC accelerates to the ACC set speed.
