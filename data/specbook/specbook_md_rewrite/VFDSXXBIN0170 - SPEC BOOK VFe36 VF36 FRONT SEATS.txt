3.7.4 Interface to vehicle electrical system.

The front seats interface to the vehicle’s overall electric & electronic network via a 24 pin hybrid connector.

The vehicle’s E&E CAN network has two sub-components (ECUs) mounted to the front seats:
- **PSM_D** (Power seat memory module) mounted within the driver’s seat.
- **SHVU_F** (Front seat heating & ventilation control unit) mounted within the passenger seat.

An Occupant Detection Sensor (ODS) is mounted within the passenger seat cushion (Vietnam variants), forming part of the Seatbelt Reminder system (SBR). Alternatively, an Occupant Classification Sensor (OCS) is mounted within the passenger seat cushion (North America variants), serving the same function as the ODS and acting as an element of the airbag control system. It detects the occupancy status of the front seats to assist the Airbag Control Module (ACM) in determining airbag deployment and suppression logic.

Refer to section 3.7.3 above for further interface conditions.

For details on CAN communication system inputs and outputs to the front seats, refer to the **E&E network spec book**.

### 3.8 Product Safety

The seating system design is developed following the considerations of IATF 16949 section 4.4.1.2 regarding Product Safety and the related steps using dFMEA, with suitable checks and validation as preventative actions to mitigate each potential failure mode. The process was initiated in steps starting with a P-diagram and interface matrix to generate a function tree as the index basis for the dFMEA itself.

### Interface Matrix

The interface matrix outlines interaction types between the front seats and other vehicle components, categorized by physically touching (P), energy transfer (E), material exchange (M), and information exchange (I).

- Interaction values:
  - **+2:** Interaction is necessary for function.
  - **+1:** Interaction is beneficial but not absolutely necessary for function.
  - **0:** Interaction does not affect functionality.
  - **-1:** Interaction causes negative effects but does not prevent function.
  - **-2:** Interaction must be prevented to achieve functionality.

### Function Tree

The function tree is divided into key objectives and associated actions to ensure product safety and regulatory compliance. The objectives include:

1. **To protect occupants in passive conditions**  
    - Ensure correct placement and fastening of seating systems during installation.
    - Test seat deformation profiles to meet crash safety standards.

2. **To protect occupants in crash events**  
    - Validate energy absorption rates during frontal and lateral crash scenarios.
    - Ensure compliance with crash test certifications, such as ECE R94 and FMVSS 271.208.

3. **To provide occupant comfort and study seating**  
    - Maintain ergonomic design and test seat cushion materials for durability under various environmental conditions.

4. **To allow potential adjustability and features**  
    - Implement physical and electronic seat adjustment functions adhering to architectural specifications.

5. **To facilitate easy manufacture and assembly**  
    - Simplify manufacturing and assembly processes by refining weld and fastener tolerances.

6. **To meet vehicle integration targets**  
    - Ensure seamless interaction of seat systems with vehicle E&E architecture and airbag control systems.

7. **To allow recyclability**  
    - Integrate reusable and recoverable materials, as per ISO 14040 standards.

8. **To meet occupant attribute targets**  
    - Validate appearance and tactile quality characteristics for all material components.

9. **To meet regulatory requirements**  
    - Adhere to international test certifications (e.g., ISO, ECE) across all components and systems of the seating assembly.

3.8 Product Safety.

The seating system design is developed following the considerations of IATF 16949 section 4.4.1.2 regarding Product Safety and the related steps using dFMEA, with suitable checks and validation as preventative actions to mitigate each potential failure mode. The process was initiated in steps starting with P-diagram and interface matrix to generate a function tree as the index basis for the dFMEA itself.

Included in the dFMEA are the following considerations to mitigate potential product safety concerns:
- Cross-check of all historical product recall campaign failure causes (NHTSA and Rapex) from the past 10 years, to ensure inclusion in the FMEA.
- Function group 9 lists every regulatory requirement’s failure-to-comply mode as a line item in the FMEA.
- Failure causes which extend into component sub-supplier’s scope have been cascaded through Special Characteristic Agreement (SCA) document for tracking and auditing through their respective organization per IATF 16949 Product Safety standards, as committed within Vinfast’s Statement of Requirements at nomination and Purchasing Terms & Conditions agreements.

3.9 Functional Safety.

Functional Safety is managed and audited at system level by a dedicated team in Vinfast, to ensure compliance with ISO 26262 requirements.

Elements of the front seats which are subject to Functional Safety verification are:
- Seat Memory ECU (PSM_D) – ASIL A requirement to prevent unintentional seat movement.
- Occupant Classification Sensor (OCS) – ASIL requirement to ensure correct occupancy status is signaled to the Airbag Control Module (ACM).

The ends of the crosstubes are permanently affixed to the sidemembers using a 90-degree flaring process, with a low-friction bush placed in the interface to minimize stiffness in the rotating joint.  

The lower attachment points on the link arms contain low-friction bushes, through which shouldered lockbolts and locknuts are installed to permanently attach them to pivot points on the attachment pressings of the track assemblies.  

The crosstube assemblies, with their link arms in the chassis assembly, provide height adjustment function, which is driven by the height adjust mechanism. The outboard rear link contains a radiused toothed gear face, providing the interface for the geared coupling with the height adjuster. To counteract the seat occupant’s weight whilst operating the height adjuster, a torsion spring is installed within the rear crosstube.  

The cushion half pan is attached to the structure via 4X M6 thread-forming bolts.  

On manual versions:  
- A track release bar is fitted, with attachment to the track release latches on either track side.  

On power versions:  
- A motor cross-brace assembly includes a motor and drivesplines which attach into the gearbox units inside the tracks.

4.1.3 Heating and ventilation system.

On the first and second-row seats of VF35 and VF36, the heating and ventilation devices include the ECU, heating mat (integrated temperature sensor), and blower. The first and second-row seats have separate ventilation and heating systems. Each ventilation and heating system consists of 4 blowers and 2 heating mats, each including a cushion mat and a back mat. 

The ECU is installed under the front-driver seat cushion or the second-row middle seat cushion. The heating mats are positioned separately onto the backrest and cushion, while the blowers are installed separately within the backrest and cushion.

For additional details regarding the input of the seat adjustment switch and Hall sensor, the PSM performs movement operations involving Track Slide Adjustment, Recline Adjustment, Tilt Adjustment, Height Adjustment, and Passenger Track Slide Adjustment. Additionally, the PSM calculates and remembers seat positions, with the MHU responsible for seat positions corresponding to the driver's ID.
