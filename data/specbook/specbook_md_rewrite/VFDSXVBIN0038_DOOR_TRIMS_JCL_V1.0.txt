#### Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization
For effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles:
- Deployment of pyrotechnic components must avoid noise and pressure peaks while ensuring sequential deployment of all components.
- Combustion residues post-deployment must not classify as hazardous or toxic waste per prevailing waste legislation. Hazardous components require separate disposal.
- Successful deployment of pyrotechnic components must produce clear visibility via acoustic or vehicle feedback.
- Pyrotechnic components must be marked precisely, including hidden elements (e.g., battery safety terminal clamps, active safety headrests).
- In cases where non-deployment occurs, pyrotechnic components must be removed without requiring pre-dismantling if accessible.
Page 29
Recycling:  
Recycled materials  
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  

Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recycles and post production recycles, e.g. recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to environmental compliance expert team at VINFAST.  

Recycling scheme  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  

Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  

The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  

Recycling scheme has to be provided to environmental expert team at VINFAST before milestone PTO (Production Try-Out).

**Vehicle Tooling**

**Generally:**  
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:  
1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

---

**Corrosion Tests:**  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

**Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:**  
- **Fog Test:** ISO 6270 CH (acceptance criteria below)  
- **Salt Spray Test:** ISO 9227 (acceptance criteria below)  

**For Organic Coatings:**  
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT):** ISO 11997 Cycle B (acceptance criteria below)  

*Alternative tests may be proposed by the supplier and accepted by a corrosion engineer.*

| Exterior                 | Medium         | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227          | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO 11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust                        |
| High & not visible for customer / High & visible | High         | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO 11997 Cycle B | CCT: See below                          |

---

**Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT:**  
Detailed evaluation results to be provided and determined based on CCT results.
Page 31
Rust creep according to ISO4628-8: 
- Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm. 
- Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.

Blistering:  
- Blister size maximum: S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).

Edge corrosion:  
- ≤ 10%.

Weld seam corrosion:  
- ≤ 5%.

Degree of rusting:  
- ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

The interior is considered a dry area with low corrosivity. Exceptions include floor areas or areas affected by wetness or abrasion caused by shoes or juices, which could produce corrosion.

Guidelines for metals and corrosion prevention:
- Avoid galvanic corrosion by coating parts when combining different metals.
- Painted edges shall be burr-free to ensure good edge coverage and avoid wear.
- Seat structure, uncoated steel parts: New parts must be corrosion-free, and corrosion-risk areas must not be visible to the customer. Extreme positions of seat rests should be considered.
- Test criteria for invisible areas may be lower than detailed above, but visible areas must be corrosion-free, and functionality must be guaranteed over the product's lifetime.
- Vehicle tooling: Usually stored in the trunk and exposed to low corrosivity; tool surfaces with wear may require medium corrosivity standards.

### Geometrical Integration

**RPS (Reference Position System):**  
The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. An RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS-system **VFDST00000011 [28]** according to the interior- and BIW-department. 

**Tolerance analyses:**  
Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:  
- **Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.**  
- **Thermal change tests among all climate terms.**  
- **Thermal expansion has to be considered.**  

**Arrangements are necessary** in order to ensure the required gap dimension of components:  
- **Clearance wiring harness:** For fixing the wiring harness on the door trim, a minimum distance of 8mm to surrounding parts is needed.  
- **Side airbag:** The minimum distance between door trim and side airbag must be at least 70mm.  
- **Armrest/Handrail:** Armrest and handrail should be in the dummy range of the seat adjustment field on the same Y-situation. The maximum difference is 10mm.  
- **IP:** Clearance to lateral cover and verification of the glove box opening.  
- **Rear seat:** Verification of the backrest folding.  

Shape and position tolerances and general tolerances have to be considered.
