**Notes on Defect Categories:**  
1. A defect marked as category "A" indicates a serious or minor defect.  
2. If no category (A or B) is specified under a defect position, the defect is applicable regardless of its location.  
3. Defects marked under category A highlight issues on the current visible rubber product belt surface.  
4. Defects marked under category B pertain to the visible surface of non-belt areas of the pressed rubber product.  
5. For components requiring interior decoration color or texture, refer to relevant color plates.  
6. Products with bright stripes must include a protective film during the production phase. Residual glue should not affect the appearance once the film is removed.  
7. For products featuring injection heads, refer to the technical drawing for specific requirements detailing surface variations between the head and the seal body.

### Additional Tolerances and Identification Requirements:

- **Nylon Nail Hole and Air Vent Spacing:** Sponge belt strips must maintain a nylon nail hole deviation of 1.5mm and an air vent spacing deviation of 10mm.
- **Dimensions of Belt Strip Punches:** Tolerances align with EC2 specifications from GB/T 3672.1 to ensure compatibility after durability testing with no deformation or abnormal operational forces exceeding 30%.
- **Tooling and Process Approvals:** All production tooling and processes require technical department approval with involvement throughout the sampling phase.
- **Durability:** Components must endure rigorous testing to ensure no visible damage or function loss post-testing (including road tests).
- **Dimensional Standards:** Boundaries and tolerances are compliant with VINFAST 3D/2D data specifications and GD&T standards.

### Quality, Identification, and Traceability:

- **Quality Goals:** Suppliers must adhere to the PPM 10 commitment, ensuring defect rates below 10 per 1,000,000 parts, with a minimum CPK of 1.33.
- **Identification Protocol:**
  - Supplier must etch or label all parts with VINFAST-approved codes.
  - Accurate barcode tracking must be implemented for selected parts.
  - Special exceptions for marking omissions must be approved in writing.
Page 14
Party B shall not stamp or paste explicit information (such as its own trademark or name) on the products unless subject to written approval from Party A.

### Product Quality Rectification Responsibility
- If Party B is responsible for the design and manufacturing of spare parts, it shall be solely responsible for rectifying product quality issues, including design, mold, and process concerns, except for modeling changes.
- If Party A (or a third party) provides the design and Party B handles manufacturing, Party B must organize a review and countersignature of the design data before acceptance. Once the design data freeze countersignature form is signed, Party B assumes sole responsibility for rectifying quality issues, except for modeling changes.
- Newly produced molds must undergo a production verification stage to confirm the matching accuracy of parts and components with the entire vehicle. Mold adjustments related to vehicle coordination shall not be considered engineering changes. The supplier must manage production quantities for sampling, cooperate fully, and bear associated mold adjustment costs.
- With respect to split parts identified for after-sales maintenance, Party B must ensure that product performance, structure, and appearance quality meet the same requirements as assembly parts, submitting a product qualification certificate accordingly.

The supplier must ensure that developed parts comply with Vietnamese regulations and VinFast specifications. These parts must obtain component type approval, and all necessary documentation must be submitted to support vehicle type approval.

- VFCAE-001-FEM-GENERAL_Analysis requirement  

### 3.4 Material Requirement  
The “SDS” is responsible for the definition and confirmation of all materials.  

Assemblies and components are to be developed, such that economical recycling of materials can be carried out at the end of the life of the vehicle. It is the responsibility of the supplier to prepare a recycling concept.  

Only the use of approved materials for each application from the global automobile industry is allowed.  

- Key blade material: H62-T  
- Material for over molding: PA6-GF30. With Satin Chrome Plated finish  

#### Weight Management  
Because vehicle weight has a significant influence on the energy consumption of the vehicle, the major goal of weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight.  

Throughout the whole development, attention must be paid to a weight-optimized design of all components. All weight reduction potentials must be presented by the supplier, including their impact on costs, timing, and quality.  

The whole system weight must be discussed and agreed upon before release.  

#### Environmental Compatibility  
Refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).  

Minimizing the environmental impacts of a product throughout its complete life cycle is critical for future innovative product development.  

A minimization of environmental impacts of a product requires:  
- The use of recyclable materials.  
- The use of recycled materials and renewable resources.  
- Prevention of hazardous substances.  
- Minimization of compartment emissions, including odor.  
- Minimization of consumption of resources.
Page 16
- Strategy for waste prevention.
- Parts marking for identification at end of life.

The requirements of the following standards have to be met:
• Reuse, Recycling & Recoverability obligations for vehicles, components, and parts according to UN Regulation No. 133.
• Parts marking for identification of materials at the end of life of vehicles, components, and parts as per ISO standards.
• Vehicle Indoor Air Quality ‚VIAQ‘ & Odor according to ISO 12219, parts 1-7, respective harmful substances targets (including TVOC & odor emissions) for interior trim parts.
• Vehicle Indoor Air Quality requirements on Russian market according to GOST33554-2015 and GOST33548-2015.
• Reduction of environmental impacts regarding the categories Global Warming Potential (Carbon footprint) and Consumption of Resources have to be considered for Life Cycle Analysis as per ISO 14040.
• Prohibition & Restriction of substances according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including national chemical inventory 2017).
• Prohibition & Restriction of substances as per Global Automotive Declarable Substances List ‚GADSL‘.

The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification must be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier.
• The conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured by the supplier through the complete product lifecycle.
• For PPAP, material data sheets (MDS) in IMDS according to IMDS Rules and Guidelines IMDS 001 and IMDS Recommendations 002 - 022 are required. Updates are required for changes.

Material data sheets must be provided by the supplier to VinFast:
Project VinFast IMDS-ID @ 214435.

Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets that consist of the mathematical signs for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<).

Material safety data sheets (SDS) according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including national chemical inventory 2017) must be provided for milestone concept confirmation. Local rules for SDS creation and UN-guidelines according to GHS Globally Harmonized System of Classification, Labeling, and Packaging of Chemicals must be considered.

Material safety data sheets must be provided by the supplier to VinFast.
