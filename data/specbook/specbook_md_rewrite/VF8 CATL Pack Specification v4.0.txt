8.2.4 Venting interface.

There is a venting interface on RESS. This device is called an air pressure equalization device (APED), and there is another external vent pipe on APED for this project. When the APED is not working, water can come into the RESS. If errors occur, such as leakage of cells or leakage of the refrigerant in the RESS, the APED serves as the opening for degassing (EPED). Therefore, the opening cannot be blocked, and a sufficient distance to adjacent areas must be kept. It should also be noted that the escaping gases can be very hot and burning.

The material and property specifications of the venting interface are detailed below:
- **Main Structure**: Al6063 + VQM + SUS304.
- **Gas-permeable Membrane**: e-PTFE.
- **Ventilation Capacity**: >300 ml/min @ 2.5 KPa.
- **Burst Pressure**: 4 ± 1 KPa.
- **Operating Temperature**: -40°C to 85°C.
- **Mounting**: M5*18, 6 N.M.
- **Flame Retardant Rating**: UL94-V0.
- **Level of Protection**: IP68, IP69K.

Functions:
- Balances the inside and outside pressure of the pack.
- Rapidly exhausts gas when product gas abnormality occurs.

The venting interface is shown in figure 5.7.

8.2.5 Mounting interface.

The mounting interface of the CATL battery pack is designed to be compatible with the existing VF8 vehicle design, which has mounting points designed for the VinES/SDI battery pack.  

The mounting points in the side flanges and front corners are the same as the VinES/SDI battery pack. Two mounting points in the middle area are also the same.  

For six points in the middle area of the battery pack, it was not possible to use the existing vehicle mounting points. Therefore, a new bracket was designed to ensure compatibility.  

The detailed interface is shown in Figure 5.8.  

Figure 5.8 Mounting interface.  

The battery pack provides interfaces to mount the trust plate at the front, the gap hiders on the side, and the aero shield at the back of the battery pack.  

For detailed design including fixings, please refer to VFDSXVBAT1278 - VF8 BAT CATL HV Battery to BIW mounting reference document.

#### 10.2 Thermal Logic
The BMS thermal logic follows the requirements from the VF Battery team. The BMS sends a signal to the VCU to turn on/off the Chiller (Cooling) or PTC (Heating) based on the cell temperature min/max.  

**Threshold values (calibratable and subject to change):**  
- **Chiller ON/OFF Logic:**  
  - Online/Driving:  
    - Max cell temp >23°C → Valve ON.  
    - Max cell temp ≤28°C → Valve OFF.  
  - DC charge:  
    - Max cell temp >32°C → Valve ON.  
    - Max cell temp ≤28°C → Valve OFF.  
  - AC charge:  
    - Max cell temp ≥32°C → Valve ON.  
    - Max cell temp <28°C → Valve OFF.  
  - Parking:  
    - High temp above 40°C → Valve OFF.  

- **PTC ON/OFF Logic:**  
  - Active Mode:   
    - Online: Min cell temp ≤-10°C → PTC ON.  
    - AC Charge: Min cell temp ≤-8°C → PTC ON.  
    - DC Charge: Min cell temp ≤5°C → PTC ON.  
    - At Normal Temp: Min cell temp >8°C → PTC OFF.  
  - Offline:  
    - Temp below -22°C (Preconditioning): ≤-22°C → PTC ON.  
    - Temp below -20°C: >-20°C → PTC OFF.  

**Note:** Change to AC charge threshold is under discussion:  
- AC Charge ≥41°C → ON, <38°C → OFF.  

**Power Request Logic:**  
The BMS sends a signal to the VCU with the required power request based on the difference of the target temperature (defined as 24°C, calibratable) and the inlet temperature.  

- **Power Request Table (calibratable):**
  - **Cooling:**  
    - Diff ≤ -7 → Power request: -7.5 kW (Active), 0 kW (Passive).  
    - Diff ≤ -6 → Power request: -7.0 kW (Active), 0 kW (Passive).  
    - Diff ≤ -4 → Power request: -4.0 kW (Active), 0 kW (Passive).  
    - Diff ≤ -2 → Power request: -2.0 kW (Active), 0 kW (Passive).  
    - Diff ≤ 0 → Power request: 0.0 kW (Active/Passive).  
  - **Heating:**  
    - Diff ≥ 0 → Power request ranges from 0.2 to 7.0 kW (Active), 0 kW (Passive).  

**CAN Signal:**  
- BMS_CoolPwrDemand/BMS_HeatPwrDemand

- Vmin < xx V (xx s) and Tmax > xx °C (xx s).
- Vmin < xx V (xx s) & Tmax-Tmin > xx °C (xx s).
- Vmin < xx V (xx s) & dT/dt > xx °C/s (xx s).
- Vmin < xx V (xx s) & within xx s, CSC communication circuit open (xx s).
- Tmax > xx °C (xx s) & within xx s, CSC communication circuit open (xx s).
- Tmax > xx °C (xx s) & within xx s, CSC communication circuit lost.
- Pack isolation fault & CSC communication circuit open (xx s).
- Tmax > xx °C (xx s) & CSC communication lost.
- dT/dt > xx °C/s (xx s) & CSC communication lost.
- Tmax-Tmin > xx °C (xx s) & CSC communication lost.
- All NTCs in one cell block are invalid & CSC communication lost.

### 11.3 C Sample Modifications and Pressure Sensor Integration
On the C sample design, VinFast requested the addition of a pressure sensor for thermal runaway detection. CATL uses a similar design for another OEM. 

**Key Details for TR Pressure Sensor Integration**:
- The TR sensor is integrated on the BMS hardware and powered directly by the vehicle's 12V supply.
- During active mode, the BMS receives pressure signals from the BPS via SPI.
- In sleep mode, if thermal runaway occurs, the BPS will maintain an alarm signal until the BMS wakes up.
- After waking up, the BMS will determine if thermal runaway has occurred, and will wake up the VCU for vehicle warning if confirmed.

### 15 Labels, Packaging, Transportation and Storage

#### 15.3 Transportation
The Battery Pack should be transported not fully charged, meeting the applicable legislation for mode of transport and location. During transportation, the battery pack should be prevented from violent vibration, shock, exposure to sunlight, rain, or any liquid. It should not be inverted to avoid short circuit occurrence. During loading and unloading, the battery should be handled gently, avoiding dropping, throwing, rolling, heavy loads, and inversions. 

The recommended transportation temperatures range between 0 to 40 degrees. If shipped by plane, the RESS should be transported with a state of charge (SOC) lower than 30%. For road or ship transportation, the RESS will be delivered with 40% SOC by CATL.

---

#### 15.4 Storage
Before loading, the Pack shall be stored at a state of charge (SOC) within the range of 20% to 70%. 

**Product storage requirements:**
- Limits for storage temperature: -40 ℃ to 60 ℃.
- Recommended storage temperature: 0 ℃ to 40 ℃.
- Recommended storage humidity: 10% to 85% RH.
- Storage environment: store the battery in a clean, ventilated, and cool environment, avoiding exposure to sunlight, high temperature, corrosive gases, violent vibration, mechanical shock, and heavy loads. It should also be kept away from heat sources.

Storage duration in dry and ventilated environments depends on the storage SOC and self-discharge specifications. Measures should be taken to prevent the battery SOC from reducing to less than 5%. The SOC and voltages of the battery need to be checked if it has been stored for over 6 months. Maintenance test methods during storage are outlined below.
