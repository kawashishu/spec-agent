6 Supplier responsibilities  
Supplier is responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemised to help mitigate the risk to the organisation of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.  

**Customer service requirements**  

**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need ensure life cycles of project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.  

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).
