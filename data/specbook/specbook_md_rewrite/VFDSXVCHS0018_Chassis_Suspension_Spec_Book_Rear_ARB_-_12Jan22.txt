4.3 Homologation and safety regulation requirements.

4.3.1 North America.

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., European regulations, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS). The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.  

b. Self-certification and test report(s).  
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s) or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance. The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that the USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate product compliance with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  
(*) Refer to Appendix 8 of the Manufacturer Handbook.  

c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations.  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that there is a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

4.3.2 Europe.

a. Homologation and safety regulation activities.  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g., United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) Regulations.  

b. Test report(s) and Certificate(s).  
The supplier is responsible for getting their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain of the UN-ECE at authorized technical services. The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance. Additionally, VinFast requires suppliers to provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings, to be submitted to relevant authorities to obtain certification for the EC vehicle type-approval, if applicable.
