1 General Document Guidelines.

1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.
This version is legally binding. This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard. Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g., what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English. All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.

- Shall.
The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.

- Should.
The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.

- May.
The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

**Requirements traceability:**

| Requirement Number | Requirement Text        | CONFIG  |
|---------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| REQ-IDNBR-VER      | Requirement Text need   | Criteria|

Remark: Text for example guidance, not binding.

**Criteria:**

- REQ:
  - GEN – Generic application, non-specific.
  - PROJ – Project specific, example VF35, VF36, VFe35.

- IDNBR:
  - Unique Identification number, marked with ID [letters, ex.: EL from exterior lighting] and number from 0001 to 9999.

- VER:
  - Version of the requirement, marked with .01 to .99.

### Work Interface Chart (RASI).

##### Work Interface Overview:
The main supplier obligations are described within the work interface chart (RASI). The supplier status (“Built to Print” or “System Development Supplier”) is defined below System/Component Specification:
1. **R**: Responsible - Executing activities properly and requesting team support.
2. **A**: Approval - Responsible for release or decision-making.
3. **S**: Support - Actively supporting execution including resource transfer.
4. **I**: Information - Entitled to request information from responsible personnel.

Deliverables are detailed under RASI.

7.3 Homologation and safety regulation requirements.

**North America:**

a. **Homologation and safety regulation activities:**  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, such as European regulations, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS).  
The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.

b. **Self-certification and test report(s):**  
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before these products can be offered for sale.  
VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  
The supplier should be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that the USA/Canada governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  
(*) Refer Appendix 8 of the Manufacturer Handbook.

c. **Duty to notify VinFast of non-compliance:**  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, if a supplier subsequently determines that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced, the supplier must notify VinFast within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or safety-related defect.  
The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

**Europe:**

a. **Homologation and safety regulation activities:**  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s), or system(s) comply with applicable regulations such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) regulations.

b. **Test report(s) and Certificate(s):**  
The supplier is responsible for ensuring their part(s), product(s), or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before these products can be offered for sale.

Status: Functional Responsibility  

VinFast requests the supplier to conduct tests as specified in certain UN-ECE regulations at authorized technical services. The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance. Supplied supporting documentation, including drawings, must be submitted to the relevant authorities to obtain certification for EC vehicle type-approval (if any). 

The supplier should familiarize themselves with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate compliance with UN-ECE regulations.

**Duty to Notify VinFast of Non-Compliance with UN-ECE Regulations**  
Notwithstanding certification of a product, the supplier may determine that non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in motor vehicle equipment they have produced. Within five working days of identifying non-compliance or a safety-related defect, the supplier must notify VinFast of the issue. A risk assessment and resolution plan must also be proposed.
