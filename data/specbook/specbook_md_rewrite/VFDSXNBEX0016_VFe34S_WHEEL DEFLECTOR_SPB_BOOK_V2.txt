Wheel deflectors are part of the Exterior functional group for VF7 (VFe34S).  
They are mounted on the FR WAL and bumper (at the front), HV battery casing (at the center), and RR WAL (at the rear).  
The purpose of the parts is to streamline airflow and aid in improving aerodynamics of the vehicle.  
The parts are non-grained plastics (PP+EPDM-M15).
