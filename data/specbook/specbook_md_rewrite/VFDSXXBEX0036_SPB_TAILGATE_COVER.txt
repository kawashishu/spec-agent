- Short descriptions, tables, comparisons with prior results and specifications, evaluations OK/NOK, corrective measure details, and testing progress status.  

#### 3.7.6 Archival Storage of Tested Parts  
Parts may only be scrapped upon approval of the VinFast test department. Testing documentation, including reports, descriptions, and parts, must be presented upon request.  

#### 3.7.7 Virtual Testing  
Virtual testing requires calculations using detailed models created by the B2P SUP to secure components' mechanical properties, dimensional stability, and passive safety. FEM calculations ensure optimization of component rigidity, strength, and durability while aiding tool dimensioning for injection molding.

3.7 Testing and Validation – DVP&R.

3.7.4 Test-report/-information:
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (part no., change index, materials, production process, additives like grease and every deviation from approved serial process).
- All parts have to be labeled with description.
- Eventually the reason for testing in case of e.g. negative test results and attachment of earlier test reports.
- Testing with exact naming of testing standard, norm, legal requirement, or exact description of agreed testing procedure.

3.7.5 Documentation of Result:
- Short description of the result (pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of result OK/NOK, pictures of the parts in testing position, etc.).
- Comparison with results of the specification book, testing specification, legal requirements, etc.
- Recommendation.
- Description of corrective measures or further approach in case of negative test result.
- Progressional testing status.
- Listing of all tests in a table with responsible person, part status, comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the B2P SUP has to give a new date for re-test with countermeasures to VF for approval with the responsible person and company conducting the test.

The VF test engineer must be informed within two working days in the event of negative test results. The VF test engineer has to be informed in periodic intervals with the actual status and progress. If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.

3.7.6 Archival Storage of Tested Parts:
Testing parts are only allowed to be scrapped if the VinFast test department agrees to it. On demand of the test engineer, the complete testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.

3.7.7 Virtual Testing:
For virtual testing, calculations are to use adequate, detailed models created by the B2P SUP. FEM models are required to optimize mechanical properties such as strength, dimensional stability under heat, rigidity, and passive safety. Injection molding tool-dimensioning is also done by simulation. On request, the finalized calculation models must be shared with VinFast technical departments without cost.

3.7.8 Component Testing:
Testing specifications for specific components are covered within the DVP process. The content must be mutually agreed upon by VinFast and the B2P SUP, making it binding.

3.7.9 Mechanical Integration Tests:
The following mechanical integration tests for complete vehicles will be performed:
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100).
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800).
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000).
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600).

Any distortions or functional disturbances across a vehicle’s functional temperature range are unacceptable. Flush and gap tolerances cannot exceed guidelines post-climate testing.

3.8 Appearance Approval – Applicable for All Visible Parts:
AAR is categorized as part of PPAP deliverables and regulated under VFDST00038401. The supplier must adhere to timing agreements for part submission and ensure OK Shape, OKTG, and approval of AAR submissions. Early phase activity (PT build) ensures LS-stage approvals aligned within the development budget and ED&D cost structure.
