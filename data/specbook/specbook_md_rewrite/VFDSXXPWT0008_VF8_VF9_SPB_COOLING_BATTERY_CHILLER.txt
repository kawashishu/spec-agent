**5.1.1 System description.**  
A Chiller is a heat exchanger that helps in absorbing heat from the hot oil from the Battery to support the process of Battery cooling. It is a plate heat exchanger with provisions for both the fluids (refrigerant to oil) to move across it. The battery coolant exchanges heat with the refrigerant in the AC circuit. The use of Chiller could come in handy during conditions when the Radiator is not able to cool down the Battery on its own.  

Required chiller will include:  
- Laminated heat exchanger  
- Thermal expansion valve (TXV)  
- Solenoid valve (if possible)  

The objective is to minimize the complexity and high commonality. Intention is to use off-the-shelf products to minimize development timing. The supplier should provide in advance a portfolio of off-the-shelf parts supporting VinFast requirements.  

---

**5.1.2 Package layout overview.**  
The complete vehicle is still under development. Use dimensions provided as reference to confirm technical feasibility and provide the initial quotation. More accurate dimensions/envelopes will be provided once they are available.  

The system designer has to coordinate all components of the module in relation to:  
- Packaging  
- Function  
- Fixing  
- Tolerances  

Below dimensions are defined based on the BEV layout. However, the objective is as compact as possible. The design, while taking into account the overall low cost and acceptable quality, is the supplier's responsibility to confirm the most cost-effective alternative(s) for each variant.

Page 10
5.1.4 System Requirements.

System suppliers must define characteristic curves or values matching the thermal and electrical requirements from HVAC and the battery. The BEV cooling system uses coolant for battery cooling, which requires cooling through the chiller. Selection of chillers must align with the coolant type and characteristics.

The following requirements must be fulfilled:
- Geometry.
- Acoustics, vibrations, resonances.
- Life expectancy given the operational profile.
- Ease of service and repair.

**Characteristic Curves:**
- Suppliers are required to provide characteristic charts matching chiller samples.
- Pressure test certificates must be produced for each chiller.

**Refrigerant Properties:**
The refrigerants utilized in the AC system include R134a and R1234yf. Their properties are depicted in charts provided.

MOPD ratings must equal or exceed 22 bar at 20°C ambient temperature with a switching voltage of 9 VDC and IP67 protection. 

**Superheat Setting and Handling Guidelines:**
8. Hazardous substances must be avoided, adhering to the ELV directive 2000/53/EC.
9. Any openings must be properly sealed to prevent contamination during shipping, using:  
   - Tape for SO-TXV.
   - Plastic bags and rubber bands for coolant pipes.
10. The tightening torque for screws (M5) should be 4.5 ± 1 Nm.
Page 11
Coolant is a solution mixed with hard water to improve heat transfer and control the operating temperature of an engine. Besides its function in cooling down the engine, coolant also contains ingredients that inhibit rust, corrosion, and scale. It also prevents cavitation, which is the rapid formation and collapse of vapor or air pockets, a frequent cause of structural damage. 

For ICE & BEV applications, VinFast will use coolant with a mixture of 50% glycol and water (AF 2000).

**Physical Properties of Coolant AF2000:**

**% Mixture** | **Freezing Point (°C)** | **Boiling Point (°C)**  
30%           | -15.5                   | 103.3  
50%           | -37.1                   | 108.9  

**Property (Ethylene Glycol AF2000):**  
- Specific Gravity @ 20°C: 1.0701  
- Specific Heat Kj/kg°C @ 25°C: 3.442  
- Freezing Point (50% Solution, °C): -36.66  
- Boiling Point (°C): 110.5  
- Kinetic Viscosity mm²/sec @ 20°C: 4.0

The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance. VinFast also requests the supplier to provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings to be submitted to the relevant authorities to get certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any). The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.

c) Duty to Notify VinFast of a Non-Compliance with UN-ECE Regulations.  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced. The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
