3.2 Technical Requirement.

**3.2.1 Project Requirements**

**3.2.1.1 Quality Requirements:**
Please refer to VINFAST “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements.”

**3.2.1.2 Certification:**
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and simulate 10 years of vehicle exposure or 60,000 km of customer service conditions. Successful completion depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on parts or subsystems per VINFAST's requirements. Parts must meet VINFAST's requirements and the corresponding test report must be issued.
- VINFAST takes responsibility for vehicle-level system integration and certification, including urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing. Component/subsystem suppliers must promptly address failure reports found during integration and certification. All changes due to failure reporting must follow the PPAP process.
- Component/subsystem integration and certification are the responsibilities of the component/subsystem supplier who must complete all tests.
- Certification of parts/subsystems may be conducted by the supplier or VINFAST-approved sub-suppliers/third parties.
- The supplier is obligated to complete all specified test requirements.

**Technical Requirements**

**3. Requirements**  

**- The responsibilities of the component/subsystem supplier:**  
The component/subsystem supplier must provide VINFAST's product release engineer with a complete component/subsystem test certification plan approved by the engineer. The plan shall include at least:  
- Number of samples  
- Test sequence  
- Place and time of each test  

**General Description of the System / Component:**  
1. VINFAST must be able to audit compliance with all requirements contained in the technical specification at all times.  
2. Inquiries regarding offers by sub-suppliers and/or sub-sub-suppliers must be agreed between the department that created the specification and the operative responsible for purchasing.  
3. The system developer commits to developing all technical solutions and requirements based on available vehicle and design data within the design process to achieve:  
    - System-specific requirements.  
    - Fulfillment of all laws and ratings applicable to system markets. Modifiers are not allowed for rating assessments.  

For technical proposals exceeding the offered scope of development, suppliers must identify impacts on costs, quality, and scheduling with clients. Releases will follow customer change management processes.  

Passive safety requirements must comply with all law requirements for system markets that are active or known with a fixed release during homologation for the B and C common platform. VINFAST will closely monitor changes to rating protocols to ensure full compliance with vehicle targets at SOP (Start of Production).  

**Module delivery requirements for suppliers:**  
Suppliers deliver the system as a module where all relevant add-on parts are already integrated. Add-on parts include:  
- Drawings  
- Simulations  
- Quality regulations  
- Results/documentation of test validation  
- Documentation of the FMEA  

All components within the assembly must interconnect seamlessly with each other. Functional dimensions must adhere to prescribed guidelines.

### 6 Supplier Responsibilities  
The supplier is responsible for ensuring the following tasks are fulfilled to mitigate organization risks:  

#### Customer Service Requirements  
After-sales spare parts should be prepared and ready from startup.
Page 22
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

### Spare Parts Support Cycle
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall need to ensure life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST's end of production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

### Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST's after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes:
- BOM table
- Parts structure and function description
- Fault diagnosis
- Special tools for maintenance
- Relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearance, parts performance parameters)
