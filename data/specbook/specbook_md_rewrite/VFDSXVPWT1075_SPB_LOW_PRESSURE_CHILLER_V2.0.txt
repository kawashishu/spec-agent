The reasons and the characteristics that must be documented are listed by authorities. These demands will be requested during the development of the part and latest in the PTO phase.  

5 Description and scope of work.

5.1 Technical requirement.  
This specification establishes the technical cooling module requirements for the BEV Chiller.  

It must be ensured at all times that VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification.  

The system developer commits to developing all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process to achieve the purpose of the project.  

The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management.  

The aim of the assignment is to have a validated chiller for the BEV variants that support HVAC and battery thermal requirements. Chiller is one of the critical components for battery cooling on BEV vehicles.  

| No | Part Name              | Part No       | Qtty | Material | Purchase Level | VF32 SMART | VF32 PLUS | VF33 SMART | VF33 PLUS |

The table describes a validated BEV chiller, part number PWT30203023, required for VinFast’s VF32 and VF33 models across various regions and configurations, including VN+ASEAN and US markets.
Page 9
5.1.1 System description.
A Chiller is a heat exchanger that helps in absorbing heat from the hot oil from the battery to support the process of battery cooling. It is a plate heat exchanger with provisions for both the fluids (refrigerant to oil) to move across it. The battery coolant exchanges heat with the refrigerant in the AC circuit. The use of a Chiller could come in handy during conditions when the radiator is not able to cool down the battery on its own.

Required chiller components will include:
   - Laminated heat exchanger.
   - Thermal expansion valve (TXV).
   - Solenoid valve (if possible).

The objective is to minimize complexity and achieve high commonality. The intention is to use off-the-shelf products to minimize development timing. Suppliers should provide in advance a portfolio of off-the-shelf parts supporting VinFast requirements.

5.1.2 Package layout overview.
Complete vehicle development is still ongoing. Use provided dimensions as a reference to confirm technical feasibility and provide an initial quotation. More accurate dimensions/envelops will be shared once available.

The system designer must coordinate all components of the module in relation to:
   - Packaging.
   - Function.
   - Fixing.
   - Tolerances.

Below dimensions are defined based on the BEV layout, but the design goal is compactness while maintaining low cost and acceptable quality. It is the supplier's responsibility to confirm the most cost-effective alternatives for each variant.

**5.1.3 Function**  
The chiller is subjected to:

1. **Heat exchange:**  
   Refrigerant side - inlet pressure on the refrigerant side: (1.68 ± 0.01) Mpa; subcooling: (5 ± 1)°C; refrigerant side outlet pressure (0.29 ± 0.003) Mpa.  
   Hot side - inlet temperature of coolant: (35 ± 1)°C; coolant flow rate: 10 L/min; heat exchange ≥4kW (refrigerant for test: R134a).

2. **Refrigerant leakage rate:**  
   Under the pressure of 0.8 Mpa (surface pressure), the annual leakage rate of evaporator refrigerant <3g.

3. **Air tightness:**  
   The chiller (lower pressure) shall be able to withstand the pressure of P air tightness = 1.5 Mpa and maintain the constant pressure for air tightness = 3 min; no leakage (test medium: water).

4. **Pressure resistance:**  
   The chiller (lower pressure) shall be able to withstand P pressure = 1.7 Mpa and maintain constant pressure P pressure = 3 min; no leakage and visible deformation (test medium: water).

**5.1.4 System requirements**  
System supplier has to define characteristic curve/values matching thermal and electrical requirements from HVAC and Battery.  

BEV cooling system will have coolant for battery cooling, which is required to be cooled in the chiller.  

Chiller selection will be based on coolant type and characteristics.  

The following requirements have to be fulfilled:  
- Geometry  
- Acoustics, vibrations, resonances  
- Life due to the operational profile  
- Service and ease of repair  

**Characteristic curves:**  
Supplier to provide characteristic charts as per chiller samples.
Page 11
5.1.5 Interfaces  
The components must be designed in a way that functionality is guaranteed in combination with all the adjoining systems and interfaces.

Pressure test certificates shall be produced in respect of each chiller.

**Refrigerant Properties**  
Refrigerant used in the AC system is R134a or R1234yf. Properties for each refrigerant are listed below:

- **R134a Properties:**
  - Air temperature condenser inlet: 35 ± 0.3°C (max 20% RH)
  - Refrigerant temperature condenser inlet: 83.5 ± 0.3°C
  - Refrigerant pressure condenser inlet: 1620 ± 10 kPa abs
  - Sub cooling condenser outlet: 5 ± 0.5 K
  - Oil circulation: 5%

- **R1234yf Properties:**
  - Air temperature condenser inlet: 35 ± 0.3°C (max 20% RH)
  - Refrigerant temperature condenser inlet: 78.5 ± 0.3°C
  - Refrigerant pressure condenser inlet: 1600 ± 10 kPa abs
  - Sub cooling condenser outlet: 5 ± 0.5 K
  - Oil circulation: 5%

**Coolant**  
Coolant is a solution mixed with hard water to enhance heat transfer and control the operating temperature of an engine. It not only cools the engine but also contains ingredients that inhibit rust, corrosion, and scale formation. Additionally, it prevents cavitation, which is the rapid formation and collapse of vapor or air pockets that frequently cause structural damage.  

For ICE & BEV applications, VinFast will use a coolant mixture with 50% glycol and water (AF2000). The physical properties of Coolant AF2000 are:

- **Mixture Properties:**
  - 30% Mixture: Freezing Point (-15.5°C), Boiling Point (103.3°C)
  - 50% Mixture: Freezing Point (-37.1°C), Boiling Point (108.9°C)

- **Ethylene Glycol (AF2000) Key Properties:**
  - Specific Gravity @ 20°C: 1.0701
  - Specific Heat Kj/kg°K @ 25°C: 3.442
  - Freezing Point (50% Solution): -36.66°C
  - Boiling Point: 110.5°C
  - Kinematic Viscosity mm²/sec @ 20°C: 4.0

### 5 Description and Scope of Work

#### 5.1 Technical Requirement  
This specification establishes the technical cooling module requirements for the BEV Chiller. It must be ensured that at all times, VINFAST can audit the observance of all requirements contained in the technical specification. The system developer commits to developing all technical solutions and requirements based on the available vehicle and design data within the design process in order to achieve the purpose of Project. 

The technical and commercial release will be proceeded by the customer according to change management. The aim of the assignment is to have a validated chiller for the BEV variants that support HVAC and battery thermal requirements. The chiller is one of the critical components for battery cooling on BEV vehicles.

#### 5.1.5 Interfaces  
The components must be designed in a way that functionality is guaranteed in combination with all the adjoining systems and interfaces.   
Below is an overview of major interface points:  
- AC Lines  
- Electrical connection  
- Chiller assembly mounting brackets  
- BIW (clearances, packaging, resonances, stiffness)  
- Traction Battery  
- Chassis (Clearances to Chassis components, e.g., Cooling system, electric system, piping, etc.)  
- Complete vehicle performance targets  

The system is subject to ambient temperature variations, from -30°C to 40°C, in a corrosive environment. The system is also expected to withstand all types of road load conditions and moderate violence caused during reckless driving on poor roads or even under off-road conditions. The most important interfaces are the chiller mounting & fixation strategy. These interfaces influence the chiller position and its clearances with its surroundings. The interfaces in between should be more of supportive character to improve durability, static and dynamic behavior, and tolerances stack-up.

#### 5.1.6 Weight Management  
The system mass should be less than 1 Kg.

#### 5.2 General CAE Requirements  
Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL **Statement of Requirement (SOR) Specification Book**.
