   - Errors include "Short to Battery," "Short to Ground," and "Contact Stuck."
   - Each error is detailed with conditions, detection time, and corresponding transmission signals:
     - **Short to Battery**: Detected when the input contact reads as shorted to battery. Transmission time is immediate, and signal is "Fault".
     - **Short to Ground**: Detected when the input contact reads as shorted to ground. Transmission time is immediate, and signal is "Fault."
     - **Contact Stuck**: Detected when one of the gear contacts is constantly pressed for 180 seconds. Transmission signal is "Stuck."

2. **Illumination Error Detection**:
   - Errors include mismatches between received gear information and output highlight ON signals, short circuits (to battery or ground), and simultaneous highlight ON activations.

3. **CAN Communication**:
   - High-speed CAN interface is utilized for gear signal communication.

4. **User Input Gear Button State Output**:
   - IGN signal detection involves hardware detection of analog levels. Signals are categorized as follows: ON (>7V), OFF (<4V), or reset levels (4-7V).

5. **Gear State Highlight Indicator Output**:
   - Rheostat-level input (PWM signal) determines duty output for gear state indicators. Values are tunable and mapped as follows:
     - Rheostat levels (0%-100%) progressively increase duty output frequency from 30% to 100%.
     - Both highlight and backlight indicators follow the same progression.

6. **Gear State Backlight Indicator Output**:
   - Backlight is activated in Initial and Normal modes.
   - If no gear state signal is received, the backlight remains ON, but the highlight is disabled.
   - Brightness is controlled through rheostat levels or PWM ILL+ signals.

7. **Gear Switch Contact Logic**:
   - Includes specifications for input voltage levels for switch contacts:
     - **Short Circuit Battery (SCB)**:
       - Sw 1: Over 4.9V (max), 4.8V (typical), 4.6V (min).
       - Sw 2: Over 4.9V (max), 4.2V (typical), 4V (min).
       - Sw 3: Over 4.9V (max), 3.8V (typical), 3.6V (min).
     - **OFF**:
       - Voltage progressively decreases to under 1V.
     - **ON**:
       - Mid-level voltage ranges depend on switch type.
     - **Short Circuit Ground (SCG)**:
       - All switches exhibit voltages under 1V in SCG conditions.

8. **Gear Shifter Signal Determination**:
   - Button states are read and transmitted based on priority (order: P > N > D > R).

9. **Gear Shifter Input/Output Characteristics**:
   - Input signals are defined as logical variables and are mapped to physical gear switch voltage levels and statuses.

VinFast requests the Supplier to conduct tests as specified in certain of the UN-ECE at authorized technical services. The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  

VinFast also requests the Supplier to provide supporting documentation, technical information, including drawings to be submitted to the relevant authorities, in order to get certification for the EC vehicle type-approval (if any).  

The Supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.  

**c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations**  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  

The Supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such an issue within five working days after determining the existence of non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
