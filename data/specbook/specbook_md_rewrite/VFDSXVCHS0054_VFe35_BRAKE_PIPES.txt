The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  

The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  
(*) Refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer_Handbook.

**c. Duty to Notify VinFast of Non-Compliance**  
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with an FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  

The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.
