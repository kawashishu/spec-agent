Fender insulator (LH & RH) are part of the functional black commodities for VF7 (VFe34S).  
2D drawing details can be accessed from TCE with part numbers BEX71011303 and BEX71011304.  

These parts are assembled and compressed between the Front Fender and Body-In-White (BIW) of the vehicle (LH & RH). They maintain clearance with the Washer Bottle System, Charging Port, and mounting brackets.  
The purpose of these Fender Insulators (LH & RH) is to absorb airborne noise to enhance the NVH performance of the vehicle.

Key Requirements for Fender Insulators:
- Compressible, lightweight, and conformable.
- Water-repellent or water-resistant.
- Manufactured by foam moulding (TL443 – PUR RG80).
- Operable across conditions, maintaining stable dimensions without color or gloss changes.
- Resistant to detrimental effects when exposed to a temperature range of -40°C to +120°C.
