1 General Document Guidelines.  

1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.  
This version is legally binding.  
This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure and VF standard.  
Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g., what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding.  
If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g., level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).  

1.2 Language.  
This document is written in English.  
All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.  

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.  
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.  

- **Shall**  
  The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.  

- **Should**  
  The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.  

- **May**  
  The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.  

**Requirements traceability:**  

| Requirement Number | Requirement Text              | CONFIG |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| REQ-IDNBR-VER      | Requirement Text need         | Criteria |

- **Remark:** Text for example guidance, not binding.  

**Criteria:**  
- **REQ:**  
  - GEN: Generic application, non specific.  
  - PROJ: Project specific, example VF35, VF36, VFe35.  
- **IDNBR:**  
  Unique Identification number, marked with ID [letters, e.g., EL from exterior Lighting] and number from 0001 to 9999.  
- **VER:** Version of the requirement, marked with .01 to .99.  
- **CONFIG:** Configuration criteria.

**Figure 3: DPSM Block Diagram**  
The DPSM Block Diagram demonstrates the interaction between the driver seat and passenger seat for the VF35 Full, VF35 Mid US, and VF35 Mid EU variants. It highlights the following key functionalities:  
- The driver seat is equipped with memory, while the passenger seat lacks memory.  
- The passenger switch block has dual functions: controlling track and power for other parts.  
- The seat heating and ventilation system, controlled by SHVU in all variants, shows control and power supply for various seat heating features.  
- Signal and power handover occurs between the front row seats, requiring approximately 25 lines.  

The diagram further shows details such as the driver's lumbar power switch connecting to lumbar motors, as well as resistance signals for seat tracking mechanisms.  

**Figure 4: APSM Block Diagram**  
The APSM Block Diagram focuses on the VF35 Base US and VF35 Base EU variants with the following key points:  
- The PSM strictly uses track signal functionality.  
- The driver switch block features dual functions, providing both track resistance signals and power for other components.  
- Similar to the driver seat, the passenger switch block also has dual functions for track and power controls.  
- Signal and power handover between front row seats occurs, with details noting that PSM-D transmits seat track information.  

The diagram illustrates the configuration for seat tracking mechanisms, lumbar motors, height motors, tilt motors, and reel motors. Power supply connections include details on the use of common and separate GND for control.

**5 Functional and Technical Requirements**  

**5.3 Functions**  

**5.3.1 Overview Functions Description**  

**Features:**  
1) Driver power seat adjustment, 8.  
2) Driver power seat adjustment, 12.  
3) Driver seat – memory.  
4) Power Lumbar Support.  
5) Front Pass Seat Ventilation.  
6) Easy Access.  
7) Seat Memory.  
8) Seat Restoring.  

**1) Driver power seat adjustment, 8:**  
User presses the Driver door side switch pack to adjust the Driver seat with the help of an electric switch pack. The user can adjust the Driver seat with movements up to 8 degrees of freedom.  

**2) Driver power seat adjustment, 12:**  
User presses the Driver door side switch pack to adjust the Driver seat with the help of an electric switch pack. The user can adjust the Driver seat with movements up to 12 degrees of freedom.  

**3) Driver seat – memory:**  
Memory seats with memory function are power-adjusted seats where the favorite seating position can be saved in the vehicle's memory and can recall that position anytime with the push of a button/switch.  

**4) Power Lumbar Support:**  
Lumbar support promotes good posture by propping up the natural curvature of the spine. The bottom of the seat back extends outward, acting as a wedge between the user's back and the car's seat to support the lower back’s natural inward curvature, preventing this fragile region from bearing the weight of the user’s body.  

**5) Front Pass Seat Ventilation:**  
User activates front passenger seat ventilation by setting the required level of cooling via MHU:  
a) The vehicle should be in Motor-ON state.  
b) The user can activate/deactivate the feature.  
c) The MHU shall provide an interface to activate the function with the setting of the required level of seat cooling.  
d) Levels of cooling provided are High, Mid, and Low.  
e) The default setting is OFF.  

**6) Easy Access:**  
This function is responsible for turning ON/OFF the Power Seat Memory.  

**7) Seat Memory:**  
To set Memory Seat Positions, adjust the Driver seat, outside mirrors, and tilt/telescoping steering column to the desired positions.
