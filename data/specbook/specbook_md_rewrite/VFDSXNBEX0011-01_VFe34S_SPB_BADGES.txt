3. Additional Technical or Functional descriptions.

The badges are part of the exterior trim and functional black for VFe34S.

Colour and Trim Brochure – VFDSXNCVC2801 – VFe34S (VF7)_Appendix_8_Color and Material_Exterior.

The badges are mounted on the front and rear end of the vehicle, interfacing with the badge plinth and rear signature lamp. 

They are controlled with 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) with primary, secondary, and tertiary datums defined below in the datum strategy.

The manufacture process of the badges includes injection molding and the use of 3M tape to install them on the vehicle.

The component should be capable of performance in all conditions. Dimensions should be stable and shall have no color or gloss change, nor show any detrimental effects when exposed to extreme conditions of -40°C to +100°C.

The supplier shall ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet the IATF 16949:2016 standard, quality management system requirements for automotive production.

The supplier shall ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet the ISO 26262:2018 standard for road vehicles – functional safety.
