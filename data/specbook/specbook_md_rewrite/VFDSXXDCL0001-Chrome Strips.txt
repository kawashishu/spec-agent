Requirements:

- Chrome strips are mounted on Glass Run Seals/Moldings. They provide a final decorative look and accentuate the vehicle appearance. Therefore, styling-relevant topics must be carefully considered.
- The requirements and functions of the development object must be fulfilled while taking into account all tolerances in single parts, assemblies, and adjoining components. Tolerance investigations should also be performed.

Illustrations:
- The depicted "End Formings" highlight specific design and integration requirements for chrome strips in adherence to tolerances needed at connections and component interfaces.

- The parts configured with gaps must meet specified requirements.  
- No fasteners, such as screws, chamfers, or recesses, may be visible in joints and joint bases.  
- Centering and joints must minimize the number of components involved in tolerance chains and consider adjacent components.  
- Screws may not be used for centering or alignment purposes for components relevant to joining. Separate centering surfaces must be provided.  
- The assembly concept and installation connections must ensure proper assembly and disassembly forces.  
- Components must function correctly in conjunction with adjoining components.  
- Coordination of components with adjoining parts such as the body, sealing system, and fixed windows must be possible.

### 4.3 Homologation and safety regulation requirements

#### 4.3.1 North America

**a. Homologation and safety regulation activities:**  
The supplier must ensure that their part(s), product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations, e.g. European, Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) and Canadian motor vehicle safety standards (CMVSS).  

The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.

**b. Self-certification and test report(s):**  
The supplier must obtain self-certifications and deliver test reports compliant with regulations applicable in targeted markets. These should detail the testing results as per safety norms and standards.
Page 12
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s), or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS requirements before being offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct specified tests in accordance with certain FMVSS/CMVSS standards, providing test report(s) as evidence of compliance. Suppliers should also be familiar with laboratory test procedures used by USA/Canada Governments for evaluating compliance.

Duty to Notify VinFast of Non-Compliance:
Suppliers must notify VinFast within five working days upon determining non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or safety-related issues, providing appropriate risk assessments and resolution plans.

### Europe: Homologation and Safety Regulations
a. Homologation and Safety Regulation Activities:
Suppliers must ensure parts, products, or systems comply with applicable UN-ECE regulations.

b. Test Report(s) and Certificate(s):
Suppliers are responsible for ensuring compliance with UN-ECE regulations before sales. VinFast requests testing as specified under UN-ECE at authorized technical services. Test report(s) and certificates must be submitted to VinFast. Suppliers must also provide drawings and technical documentation to relevant authorities for EC vehicle type-approval where applicable. Familiarity with European laboratory test procedures is required.

c. Duty to Notify VinFast of Non-Compliance:
Similar to FMVSS/CMVSS, suppliers must report non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations or safety-related defects within five working days after identifying such issues, along with a risk assessment and resolution plan.
