**Temperature of an engine and coolant function for ICE and BEV applications:**  
Coolant is used to manage an engine's temperature. Besides cooling the system down, it contains ingredients to inhibit rust, corrosion, and scale while preventing cavitation, which is a frequent cause of structural damage.  

For ICE and BEV applications, VinFast will use coolant mixed at 50% glycol and water (AF 2000).  

---

**Physical Properties of Coolant (AF2000):**  

| % Mixture | Freezing Point (°C) | Boiling Point (°C) |  
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|  
| 30%       | -15.5              | 103.3             |  
| 50%       | -37.1              | 108.9             |  

---

**Ethylene Glycol (AF2000):**  

| Property                            | Value   |  
|-------------------------------------|---------|
