NVH and Driving Comfort.
General: Complete Vehicle NVH and driving comfort targets.  
The vehicle shall enable acoustics and vibration comfort that is well balanced with vehicle dynamics and drivability to ensure long-distance driving comfort as well as driving over rough roads without being exhausting or annoying. This requires the absolute absence of squeak and rattle issues under all load cases such as speed, maneuver, and temperature.

Supplier Responsibility.  
The validation of NVH and driving comfort will be done at the complete vehicle level and comprises real customer operation conditions. Before this validation takes place, the supplier must ensure the readiness of components or systems for durability and general testing. Evidence for test maturity must be reported in the DVP&R (Design, Verification and Development Report) at the component level.  

System suppliers are required to perform validation activities as specified in technical specifications. All parts required for these validation activities as specified by the DVP&R must meet maturity levels. VINFAST will define quality criteria and validation methods for supplier alignment. Suppliers must provide intensive cooperation with the development and manufacturing teams, particularly regarding root cause investigations, while achieving vehicle NVH targets (objective and subjective) at both component and system levels.

All components must be free of squeak and rattle noises to avoid psychoacoustic annoyance during all operating conditions, including audio acoustic excitation. The robustness of the design must be reported virtually and verified during the hardware phase before serial production. Actuation noises must not be audible and must represent high-quality integration in the complete vehicle. Requirements must be fulfilled across environmental and thermal conditions. During serial manufacturing, a capable quality assurance process must maintain quality levels. Suppliers must provide components for testing and NVH tuning and ensure specialist participation during local testing and troubleshooting.

Vehicle Safety.  
Cooperation with VinFast’s vehicle safety department is essential. Suppliers are responsible for supporting the integration of vehicle safety functions actively. Lifetime relevant laws, ratings of selling markets, and OEM requirements must be considered to ensure compliance.
Page 15

**Interior Parts Emissions (Bag Method):**  
Emissions from interior components, semi-finished products/auxiliary means, and surface materials (foils, artificial leather, films) must be tested as per ISO 12219, part 2 ("bag method"). Compliance with emissions target values must be validated by the supplier through measurements set by VinFast.

---

**Harmful Substances in Components and Materials:**  
The emission behavior of products must be assessed on representative components as early as possible. Passenger compartment emissions of volatile organic compounds must be minimized. Required emission measurements for confirmation must be performed by VinFast-approved testing institutes, as agreed with their specialist department.  

Suppliers are encouraged to request information regarding approved testing institutes from VinFast. Specific project-related requirements can be found in relevant documents like the Emission Guideline.

Volatile organic compounds of components must adhere to ISO 12219. The prohibition of harmful substances must be maintained throughout the product's lifecycle.  

The following requirements apply:  
- Test results must be reviewed by VinFast’s specialist department.  
- A written attestation regarding the safety of volatile compounds for human health must be provided if requested.  
- Measurement results for VOC and fogging compliance must be submitted before milestone purchase release.  

Limits for substances emitted by components of the full interior compartment are specified in VIAQ Guideline VFDSXVCVC3401.

Page 27
Material Requirements & Corrosion.

Corrosion Requirements for Interior: Screws, bolts on handles, mirrors, key seat belts, trunk area, seat structure, invisible structural parts, vehicle tooling.

**Generally:**
For determining corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. **High corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very high corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

**Corrosion Tests:**  
The parts must pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

**Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:**  
- **Fog test:** ISO6270 CH (acceptance criteria defined below).  
- **Salt spray test:** ISO9227 (acceptance criteria defined below).

**For Organic Coatings:**  
- **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B (acceptance criteria defined below).  
- Alternative tests may be proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

**Test Criteria Table:**

| Area                 | Corrosivity | Metallic Coatings      | Organic Coatings    | Pass Criteria       |
|----------------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Interior mounted parts, dry area | Low         | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 96 h → ISO6270 CH | No red rust         |
| Exterior             | Medium      | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227   | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust CCT: See below |
| High & not visible for customer / High & visible | High/Very High | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust CCT: See below |

**Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings After CCT:**  
- **Rust Creep:**  
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.  
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1-2 mm.

- **Blistering:** Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).

- **Edge Corrosion:** ≤ 10%.

- **Weld Seam Corrosion:** ≤ 5%.

- **Degree of Rusting:** ≤ Ri 1 (according ISO4628-3).

---

**Additional Requirements:**  
The interior is generally considered as a dry area, meaning an area with low corrosivity. Exceptions might occur for floor areas or areas where wetness/abrasion by shoes or drinking juices could produce corrosion.

- **Galvanic Corrosion:** If combining different metals, avoid galvanic corrosion by coating such parts.
- **Edges:** Edges, especially painted edges, must be burr-free for good edge coverage and to avoid wear.
- **Seat Structure:** For uncoated (blank steel) seat structures, new parts must be corrosion-free. Areas with corrosion risks must remain invisible to the customer. Extreme positions of seat-rests must be considered.
- **Invisible Areas:** Test criteria may be lower for invisible areas, but it must be ensured that no corrosive products appear in visible areas. Full function over the product's lifetime must be guaranteed.
- **Vehicle Tooling:** Usually stored in the trunk, exposed to low corrosivity. For tool surfaces with wear, the corrosivity may be medium.

### Test Plan

The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding test engineer of VinFast.

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly or whenever new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of their component lies with the SDS. Testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The SDS must ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend testing at the SDS site or their testing centers.

Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast and SDS. 

If testing is conducted with incorrect parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing must be redone at the cost of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests must be re-planned, and the re-testing must be paid for by SDS if they are at fault for the failure.

#### Following Data to be Included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and timeline of the testing (in the form of a project plan).
- Part variant and description of the part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible to use the draft DVP&R provided by the VinFast testing department. Initial data entries must be completed by the SDS and submitted to VinFast at least four weeks after the nomination of the SDS.

The SDS must create a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.

#### Sequence of Testing:
The sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast.

The test plan must be coordinated and jointly approved by responsible VinFast departments and SDS. The DVP&R must be approved by the test department, SQA (VinFast), and SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. If any scheduling delay occurs, the SDS must deliver proposals to meet the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS must draft a test plan for each single component.
Page 29
The information, such as beginning and end of testing, for the test plan required from the SDS is marked as “red” in the attached example test plan.

**Test plan example**

---

**Testing**

**General**

The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.17).  
It must be guaranteed, that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested!  
In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.  

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS have to be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered from VinFast by the SDS.  

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.  

Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department, have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.  

The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for only his component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VFDST-requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VinFast.  

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved.  

All tests must be documented according to VF standard, alternatively to SDS standard, if this is accepted by VinFast.

The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification.  

The tests have to be brought in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.  

Samples for sample inspections to be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (in coordination with the test department).
Page 30
Even manual samples can provide sufficient information in certain cases. Measures can thus be introduced in time in the event of assembly problems in order to ensure the installability of the test parts.

VinFast Logistics determines the number of sample parts, while VinFast Purchase orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS. CAD data models in compliance with VinFast requirements must be provided in time for virtual sample manufacturing.

### Marking of Sample Parts
Sample parts must be marked in accordance with VF Standard VFDST00008700 [41]. Preparation of measurement reports must follow VF Standard VFDST00008900 [43]. Reference point systems must meet VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28].

### Release by Test Departments
The responsible VinFast test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the SDS during the complete vehicle integration tests.

The SDS must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of problems such as negative test results, wrong parameters, or processes, the SDS must submit a test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions to meet milestones and achieve targets. An "OK" or "NOK" result needs to be stated on the first sheet of the report.

### Analyses and Test Reports
The SDS is required to provide measurement reports (VF Standard VFDST00008900 [43]) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during the prototype generations.

After individual tests, the test samples must be analyzed in detail. The measurement and test results are to be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report. The report must be handed over to the responsible VinFast department for release.

Upon request, results combined with documentation of tests performed (including initial sample inspections and inspections conducted parallel to development) must be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests carried out parallel to series production are to be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.

• The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.  
• These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VinFast and the SDS, and will be binding.  
• If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.  
• Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.  

### Geometrical Integration  
**General**  
See General Engineering Requirements for Suppliers.  

RPS (reference position system): The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. A RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS-system and VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28] according to the interior and BIW-department.  

### Tolerance Analyses  
Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:  
• Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses  
• Thermic change tests among all climate terms  
• Thermal expansion has to be considered  

### Interfaces  
The components must be designed such that the function is guaranteed in combination with the adjoining systems.  
The interfaces must be worked out in cooperation with VinFast in consideration of a quality method (e.g. FMEA, risk filter).
