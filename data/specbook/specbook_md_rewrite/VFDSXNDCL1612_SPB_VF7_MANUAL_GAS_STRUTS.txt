- Recycling & Recoverability – UN Regulation No. 133.  
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances – Vietnam Law No. 06/2007/QH12.  
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances – GADSL.  
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances – California Proposition 65.  
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances – Annex XIV, XVII of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.  
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances – Annex II of Directive 2000/53/EC.  

Functional/Performance:  
- Refer to DVP DVPRXNDCL1612 & SOR VFSRXNDCL1572 for:  
  - Function requirement and design consideration such as GD&T datum targets, tolerance zone, spring back variation, bend radii, load requirement etc.  
  - Water management and tightness: VFDS VFDST00009200.  
  - Bracket CAE requirements: VFSRXXCVC0201.

40±2°C for 6 hours, install it on the testing machine within 10 seconds after with piston rod pointing downwards. Operate the gas spring for 5 cycles within 2 minutes. Repeat with 80±2°C. After two cold and thermal shock tests, place the gas spring in 20±2°C for 4 hours.

**Strength:**
Fatigue strength test: VFDST00066200 requires 15,000 liftgate open-close cycles.

**Durability/Fatigue:**
- Endurance test: Mount the gas spring on a testing machine at normal temperature to the actual loading state. Continuously perform 25,000 cycles uniformly at a frequency of 4 to 6 times per minute. The force value of the parts is removed, and the temperature is -30±2°C, followed by circulation through 2,000 times. Repeat the same test with 80±2°C at a frequency of 2 times per minute. After completing the tests, place the spring in 20±2°C.

**Durability/Impact:**
Refer to DVP DVPRXNDCL1612 for violent slamming, slamming the lid with rotary latch closed, force closing, pressing the lid into lock detent, force pulling of opening grips, lateral force acting on the trunk lid, anti-theft protection, and system rigidity curve.

**Durability/Corrosion:**
Refer to VFDST00040300 for VinFast Standards and DVP DVPRXNDC1612 for resistance to abrasion from textiles using a crock meter, abrasion with wetted textile, etc.

**Safety – Security:**  
Not applicable.

**Thermal and Aero:**  
Not applicable.

**EMC:**  
Not applicable.

**NVH:**  
NVH and Driving Comfort – at the complete vehicle level:
- No background noise in compliance according to VFDST00069500.
- Specifications of VFDST00064400 and VFDST00048000 must be met (Rattle/Audio disturbance factor must reach at least RI 7; Background noise according to VFDST00048000 must be at least RI 8).

**Safety:**  
Products or systems comply with applicable regulations: FMVSS, NCAP, ECE.

**Serviceability:**  
Refer to the service manual.
