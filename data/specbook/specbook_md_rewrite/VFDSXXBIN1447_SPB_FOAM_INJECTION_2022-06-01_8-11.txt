5 Description and scope of work.

5.2 General CAE Requirements.
Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL.

5.3 Material requirement.
Polyurethane foam. Refer to specifications in Appendix 1.

5.3.1 Material selection.
Material concepts must be chosen to meet the requirements of this specification book. Only materials and manufacturing methods may be selected, which are released by the specialist department for "Operating strength and Materials."

5.3.2 Requirements for Vehicle Recycling, Utilization, and Control of Prohibited and Restricted Substances.

A) Requirements for the Limit Value of Prohibited Substances.
The materials used for parts and components must meet the requirements of the national standard and VINFAST. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) content in spare parts were sampled and tested according to ZEK 01.4-08. The sampled substances included the following 18 items:
1. Naphthalene  
2. Acenaphthylene  
3. Acenaphthene  
4. Fluorene  
5. Phenanthrene  
6. Anthracene  
7. Fluoranthene  
8. Pyrene  
9. Chrysene  
10. Benzo[a] Anthracene  
11. Benzo[b] Fluoranthene  
12. Benzo[k] Fluoranthene  
13. Benzo[j] Fluoranthene  
14. Benzo[a]pyrene  
15. Benzo[e]pyrene  
16. Indeno[1,2,3-c,d]Pyrene  
17. Dibenzol[a,h] Anthracene  
18. Benzo[g,h,i] Perylene.

B) Requirements for IMDS data.
Details on IMDS requirements will be outlined in further documentation.
Page 12
The supplier must submit real IMDS data of parts or materials on time. The approval and acceptance of the IMDS data by VINFAST will be one of the necessary conditions for the adoption of PPAP.

C) Requirements for the Control System of Vehicle Recycling, Utilization, and Prohibited and Restricted Substances. Suppliers must establish control systems and procedures for the management of banned substances, and be willing to accept and ensure that they are audited by the competent national authorities and VINFAST.

### 5.3.3 Environmental Compatibility
The minimization of environmental impacts of a product through the complete lifecycle is a key factor for the future development of innovative products. A minimization of environmental impacts of a product requires:
- Use of recyclable materials.
- Use of recycled materials and renewable resources.
- Prevention of hazardous substances.
- Minimization of compartment emissions, including odor.
- Minimization of consumption of resources.
- Strategy for waste prevention.
- Parts marking for identification at end-of-life.

### 5.3.3.1 The requirements of the following standards have to be met:
- Reuse, Recycling & Recoverability obligations for vehicles, components, and parts according to UN Regulation No. 133.
- Parts marking for identification of materials at end-of-life of vehicles, components, and parts according to ISO standards.
- Vehicle Indoor Air Quality, VIAQ & Odor according to ISO 12219, parts 1–7, respective harmful substances targets (including TVOC & odor emissions) for interior trim parts.
- Vehicle Indoor Air Quality requirements on the Russian market according to GOST33554-2015 and GOST33548-2015.
- Reduction of environmental impacts regarding the categories Global Warming Potential (Carbon footprint) and Consumption of Resources, which have to be considered for Life Cycle Analysis according to ISO 14040.
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including national chemical inventory 2017).
- Prohibition & Restriction of substances according to Global Automotive Declarable Substances List, GADSL.
Page 13
## 5.3.4 Emissions & Toxicology

### 5.3.4.1 Odor
Interior parts emissions (bag method):
The emissions of interior components, semi-finished products/auxiliary means, and surface materials (foils, artificial leather, films) must be checked according to standard ISO 12219, part 2 ('bag method'). The supplier must prove the fulfillment of target values for interior part emissions via measurements defined by VinFast.

#### Harmful substances in components and materials:
The emission behavior of the product must be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment must be minimized. Measurements for confirmation must be conducted by approved testing institutes, as defined by VinFast. Additional requirements can be found in project-specific documents such as the Emission Guideline.

Volatile organic compounds of components must conform to ISO 12219 standards. Prohibited substances compliance must be ensured through the complete product life cycle. The supplier must provide VOC and Fogging test results before the milestone purchase release.

---

## 5.3.5 HC Emissions

### 5.3.5.1 Fundamentals
Compliance with legal and client-specific emission standards must be guaranteed. This includes adherence to thresholds for vehicle and interior specifications.

#### Essential compliance points:
- The safety of volatile substances must be confirmed in writing according to VinFast standards (VFDST00007601, VFDST00007602, VFDST00007604, "Hazardous Materials").
- Development and subsequent series production efforts must aim for minimal HC emissions of components. Compliance must be maintained throughout the service life.
- A "Component description for recording HC emissions" must be submitted early to the relevant design department. Material or process changes must update this description.

IMDS material data sheets and EC safety data sheets must be submitted to the quality department. Proof of emission properties must be provided through measurements coordinated with the Plastics development quality department. Testing must be conducted by VinFast-recognized institutes.

### 5.3.5.2 Total HC emissions as per CARB
The scope of development defined in this Requirements Specification must meet the emission value limit of 0.4 mg in new condition, as per (VFDST00031102).
Page 14
5.3.5.2 Total HC Emissions as per CARB.

The scope of development described in this Requirements Specification is to be measured in new condition as per VFDST00031102. When subsided, the emission value must not exceed 0.4 mg.

Subsided condition starts one year after completion of the component and lasts until the end of the service life. Supply thresholds for the new condition and the subsided condition applicable during the entire duration must be agreed with the quality and the Design department. The test frequency is to be determined.

General Note: If during measurements as per VFDST00031102 the threshold is expected to be exceeded, it is recommended to execute a screening analysis of emissions to gain indications for component or material optimization.

5.3.5.3 Volatile Substances, Sum of Volatile Substances, Odor.

Generally, the following applies:
- Volatile substances of the scope of development are to be tested on representative materials or components as soon as possible by means of thermo desorption as per [8], formaldehyde determination as per [10], and odor as per [9].
- Values established by the above measuring processes are often not directly transferrable to the emission of components. Values established from more complex and more realistic measuring processes (e.g., [11]) are therefore decisive.

The following applies for measurement as per [9]: Grade of odor assessment as per [9] better or equal to 3, no unpleasant odor.

5.4 Traceability.

For part requirements, follow specifications, please refer to VinFast standard VFDST00010502.

Labeling of Parts:
Supplier follows VinFast standard VFDST00000010.

6. Testing and Validation and DVP&R.

DVP and PV test responsibility follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for system, sub-system & component level inline with Complete Vehicle Specification book in the concept phase. Detailed test plan for hardware tests in file DVP&R and needs work with Testing & Validation department:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing setup with pictures).
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of a project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

DVP for Component: 160,000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first).
