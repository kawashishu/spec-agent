2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Positions moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, and road salts.
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions affected by road spray.
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for positions affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

---

### Corrosion Tests
Parts must pass system/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests.

#### Component Test Requirements:
- **Metallic Surfaces:** Fog test (ISO6270 CH), Salt Spray Test (ISO 9227). Acceptance criteria defined below.
- **Organic Coatings:** Cyclic Corrosion Test (ISO11997 Cycle B).

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by corrosion engineers.

#### Test Criteria Table:
| Area                      | Corrosivity   | Metallic coatings               | Organic coatings                  | Pass Criteria         |
|---------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Interior mounted parts, dry area | Low           | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227            | 96 h → ISO6270 CH                  | No red rust           |
| Exterior                  | Medium        | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227            | 5 cyc. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B      | NSS: No red rust      |
Page 34
High & not visible for customer / High & visible:  
480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227  
10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B  

**Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:**  
- **Rust creep according to ISO4628-8:**  
    - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm  
    - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.  
- **Blistering:**  
    - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  
- **Edge corrosion:** ≤ 10%  
- **Weld seam corrosion:** ≤ 5%  
- **Degree of rusting:** ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3)  

The interior is basically considered a dry area, meaning areas with low corrosivity. Exceptions might be the floor area or areas where wetness/abrasion by shoes or drinking juices could produce corrosion.  

If combining different metals, avoid galvanic corrosion by coating such parts. Edges, especially painted edges, shall be burr-free for good edge coverage and to avoid wear.  

Seat structure (uncoated, blank steel): At least new parts must be corrosion-free, and further, the areas with corrosion risk must not be visible to the customer. Consider extreme positions of the seat-rests. On other invisible areas, the test criteria may also be lower than those mentioned above. However, it must be ensured that no corrosive products appear in visible areas, and the full function over the lifetime must be assured.  

Vehicle tooling: Usually stored in the trunk, it is considered to have low corrosivity exposure. For tool surfaces with wear, the corrosivity might be medium.

**Test Plan:**  
The test plan regulates who and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also provides results in a good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results must be ensured at all times. If VinFast requests verification of test results on their own, the SDS must deliver the needed parts free of charge.  

The test procedures and the documentation must be approved by the corresponding test engineer of VINFAST.  

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly or as new data/information due to development changes becomes necessary.  

Responsibility for complete safeguarding of the component lies with the SDS. Testing must be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results within the committed schedule. The SDS must ensure that VinFast receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast may attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers.  

Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast and SDS.
Page 35
If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the cost of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned, and the retesting must be paid by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

**Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:**
- Testing with a declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in the form of a project plan).
- Part variant and description of part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by the VINFAST testing department. The initial data filling has to be done by the SDS and submitted to VinFast (at least 4 weeks after the nomination of the SDS).

The SDS must plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage. 

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. 

The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SDS. The DVP&R must be agreed upon by the test department, SQA (VinFast), and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS must deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS shall draw up a test plan for each single component. 

The information, such as the beginning and end of testing, required for the test plan from the SDS is marked as “red” in the attached example test plan.

**Test plan example**
[Visual reference from the example test plan]
Page 36
### Testing: General

The SDS prepares a detailed, backdated testing plan in time, considering the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.17). It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested. 

To prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined whenever possible. Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS must be stated in the quotation of the SDS and ordered from VinFast.

Unless otherwise agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed with the delivery. Parts required for testing activities at VinFast’s test department must be provided by the SDS free of charge. 

The SDS must ensure compliance with all relevant legislation for their component. Additionally, internal VFDST requirements outlined in the performance specification must be fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and submitted to VinFast. 

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations must also be achieved. Tests must be documented per VF standards or SDS standards, if accepted by VinFast. 

The SDS evaluates and performs tests required for the serial development phase as per the specification. Test results must be incorporated into the attached DVP&R template and submitted along with the offer. Samples needed for inspections must be made available in time, or no later than the agreed date in coordination with the test department. Even manual samples can provide sufficient information in certain cases to address assembly-related challenges ensuring the installability of parts. 

VinFast "Logistics" determines the number of sample parts; VinFast "Purchase" orders them. Each sample part’s delivery must include a measurement report. Positive disassembly and inspection reports from the SDS, aligning with the latest build level, must accompany test reports based on the DVP&R standards. 

Disassembly and inspection activities are conducted by the SDS. CAD data models aligning with VinFast requirements must be provided in time to facilitate virtual sample manufacturing.
