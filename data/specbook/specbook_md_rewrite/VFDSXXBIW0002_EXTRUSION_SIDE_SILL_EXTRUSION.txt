**3.8 Function Safety (FUSA)**  

**a) A formal request to comply with ISO 26262:**  
- The supplier must ensure that the developed/manufactured parts meet ISO 26262:2011 standard (for car programs) or ISO 26262:2018 standard (for scooter and bus programs).  
- The supplier must ensure that the developed/manufactured parts meet IATF 16949:2016 standard.  

**b) The specification of the scope of supply:**  
- A list of all the elements of the item.  
- Block diagrams (functional and/or physical) showing significant elements, key relationships between them, interfaces with external elements (typically other vehicle systems), and the required functionality from other vehicle systems.  
- Performance, technical, environmental, and constraints on the item’s usage.  
- Applicable laws and standards that affect the development of control systems.  
- Known hazards and failure modes.  

**NOTE:**  
The specification of the scope of supply defines the functions, properties, and boundaries of the items or elements requested from the supplier.  

**c) The safety goals or the set of relevant safety requirements:**  
- These include their assigned ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level), if already available, depending on what the supplier is quoting for.  
- A conservative assumption can be made if the ASIL is not known at the time of supplier selection.  

- **Safety Goals & Functional Safety Requirements and associated attributes:**  
   - **Safety goal requirement:**  
     - The requirement may state what **not** to do.  
     - FTTI: An attribute of the safety goal as well as a safe state.  
     - ASIL: An attribute of the safety goal.  

   - **System requirement:**  
     - No signal name should appear in the requirement, only physical entities such as speed, acceleration, yaw perceived by the user or information entities such as an accelerator pedal if the item is a subsystem of the vehicle.  

- Requirements may be assigned to subsystems already or refer to the system as per ISO definition, defined in the item definition:  
   - FTTI: Most of the time inherited from the safety goal. Potentially, the FTTI is already decomposed.  
   - ASIL: Likely no ASIL decomposition at this stage, but possible if the item is a subsystem interacting with an existing subsystem to mitigate a risk.
