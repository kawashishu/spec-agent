3.7.1 Test plan. 

The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times.  

For tests, the B2P SUP is contracted.  

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.  

The B2P SUP has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend at any testing at the B2P SUP site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed between VinFast/B2P SUP.  

If testing was done with wrong parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the cost of B2P SUP. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned and the retesting has to be paid by B2P SUP if they are responsible for the failure.  

Following data has to be included in the DVP&R:  
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, legal requirement.  
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing set-up with pictures).  
- Responsible test department.  
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).  
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).  
- Part variant, description of part.  
- No. of tested components/parts.  

The B2P SUP is responsible to use the draft DVP&R provided by VF testing department.  

The B2P SUP has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.  

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VF.  

Upon request, the B2P SUP must use a test plan for each single component.
Page 10
3.7.2 Test plan example.  
The DVP must be updated weekly with specific points provided by the supplier.

3.7.3 Testing.  
3.7.3.1 General.  
The B2P SUP provides a detailed testing plan in alignment with the vehicle timing chart.  

- It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant is tested to prevent gaps in validation.  
- Mechanical and electrical tests must be combined to avoid redundant testing whenever feasible.  
- The supplier must download VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC for reference and compliance.  
- Each sample part delivery must include a measurement report unless otherwise agreed.  

#### Component Developer Obligations:
- Component developers must ensure compliance with all applicable laws and internal VF requirements outlined in the performance specification.  
- All relevant target market law obligations must be addressed.  
- Thorough documentation of test results using photos in test reports is required.

#### Test Reports and Development:
- All tests must follow VinFast standards or alternative B2P SUP standards if explicitly accepted by VF.  
- The B2P SUP must evaluate and execute testing phases for development according to specifications.  
- Test plans must utilize the DVP&R template, attached to the offer.  
- Sample inspections must be made available on the agreed schedule in coordination with the test department.
