### Circuit Diagram Description: Gear Shifter Switch
The diagram illustrates the integration of the gear shifter switch components within the vehicle system. The features include:

1. **Power Supply**:  
   - Power is supplied via the battery (BAT) through a voltage regulator.
   - The regulator ensures the stability of voltage required for the circuit's components.

2. **CAN Network Integration**:  
   - The gear shifter switch is connected to the CAN network via CAN_HS_HIGH and CAN_HS_LOW lines, enabling real-time data communication with the vehicle's control units.

3. **LED Back Lighting**:  
   - Each gear position (P, R, N, D) is equipped with backlight LEDs for visual indication.
   - LEDs are monitored using PWM for brightness and status control.

4. **Gear Position Input**:  
   - Mechanical input is processed through the contact points for each gear. These input signals are passed to the MCU for processing.

5. **MCU (Microcontroller Unit)**:  
   - The MCU serves as the central controlling unit for managing gear selection and associated signals.
   - It communicates active gear positions, LED statuses, and error diagnostics.

6. **Functional Safety**:  
   - Active gear indications and status LEDs are monitored via LED_PWM control to ensure no discrepancies between user selection and system status.
   
This sophisticated diagram highlights the integration of hardware and software to ensure safe and reliable gear shifting functionality within VinFast vehicles.

2) State Machine.  
The state machine diagram represents the flow of operations beginning from the "IGN ON" state and progressing through key actions related to the P/R/N/D gear selection process. Key transitions involve button inputs, CAN signal transmissions, receptions, and highlight activations for feedback display. Conditions such as button errors are integrated into the system checks.

3) State Lead Time.  
The state lead time process highlights the sequence and the timing involved in gear setting operations:  
- **Button Press Timing:** Upon pressing the P/R/N/D button, an error check is performed with a lead time of 50ms.
- **CAN Signal Transmission:** After the error check, the system transmits the corresponding P/R/N/D signal via CAN in 10ms. 
- **VCU or TCU Interaction:** The signal reaches the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU for BEV) or Transmission Control Unit (TCU for ICE) for processing the gear status.

4) CAN data structure - ICE:
   - The ICE module involves signals such as:
     - Input CAN signals: DT_DISP_GRDT (0x3FD), CRC_DT_DISP_GRDT, ALIV_DT_DISP_GRDT, DISP_PO_GRB.
     - Output CAN signals: ST_GWS (0x197), CRC_ST_GWS, ALIV_ST_GWS, OP_GWS.

5) CAN data structure - BEV:
   - The BEV module involves signals including:
     - Input CAN signals: GS_DriveReq (0x108), CHKSM_GS_DriveReq, ALIVE_GS_DriveReq, GS_TargetGearReq.
     - Output CAN signals: VCU_HV_DrvSys_status (0x0D9), CRC_VCU_HV_DrvSys_status, ALIV_VCU_HV_DrvSys_status, VCU_ACTGear.

2. Gear Shifter function description – to be determined (on going).

1) Operation mode control:
   - Based on the vehicle condition, the Gear Shifter operates in three modes:
     - **Initial mode**: Initializes MCU to prepare the unit for operation. Backlight control is active while waiting for a valid gear state signal.
     - **Normal mode**: Performs Gear button detection/transmission, highlight/backlight illumination brightness control, and error control.
     - **Sleep mode**: Reduces dark current and minimizes power use for the MCU. Gear button detection/transmission and highlight/backlight illumination brightness control are not performed.

   | Mode          | Button Signal | Indicator Output         | Timer to Sleep |
   |---------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------|
   | Initial mode  | X             | O (Backlight only)       | N/A            |
   | Normal mode   | O             | O                        | N/A            |
   | Sleep mode    | X             | X                        | N/A            |

2) Error control:

There are four switch contact states depending on voltage:  
- a) SCB (Short Circuit Battery)  
- b) OFF  
- c) ON  
- d) SCG (Short Circuit Ground)  

| Switch | SCB                      | OFF              | ON               | SCG                |

VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain of the FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as an evidence of compliance.  

The Supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures (*) that USA/Canada Governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  
(*) Refer to Appendix 8 of Manufacturer_Handbook.

#### c) Duty to notify VinFast of non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations:
Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations, or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item it has produced.  
The Supplier has a duty to notify VinFast on such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect.  
The Supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

### 7.3.2 Europe
