360° Surround View Monitor: Uses 4 cameras distributed around the vehicle to separately collect images in various directions for seamless stitching to form a bird's-eye view of the vehicle and output it to the MHU display terminal, so that the driver can monitor the real-time situation around the vehicle.

SVM has many sub-functions, see the table below for details:

**System Sub-System Function Description**  

- **Top-view image:**  
  After the SVM is started, the system will process the images of the four cameras, perform correction, stitching, and cropping, and finally output a top-view image, allowing the driver to see the images around the vehicle in real time.  

- **2D image:**  
  After the SVM is turned on, the system displays the stitched panoramic image and single view on the MHU by default, which includes the front view, back view, left view, and right view, along with the single view of each perspective.  

- **Turn light switchover view:**  
  After entering the SVM, the user can switch to the view of the corresponding direction by dialing the turn signal to easily view the situation at the turn.  

- **3D image:**  
  In addition to displaying the panoramic stitching bird's-eye view, the SVM 3D perspective switches to a stereoscopic view centered on the vehicle. The surrounding environment in the 3D view corresponds to the real scene and can be freely switched around the vehicle body at any 360° horizontal viewing angle.  

- **Auxiliary line:**  
  SVM will display auxiliary lines along with the 2D front and rear views. The position of the auxiliary lines will be adjusted in real-time following the rotation of the steering wheel.  

- **Hitch guidance line:**  
  If enabled, the SVM displays the hitch guide line when the rear view is shown. This guide line adjusts in real-time depending on the rotation of the steering wheel.  

- **RCTA alarm:**  
  When RCTA requires a warning, SVM displays the warning to the user in the form of images on its interface.  

- **Calibration:**  
  After the vehicle is off the assembly line, it undergoes a specially designated calibration process at a site to adjust and optimize the stitched image for optimal performance.

Type: Functional.  
Status: Accepted.  

When the user enters the SVM interface, the SVM can automatically switch to the response view after the user dials the left/right turn signal.

11.4.4.2.5 / Auxiliary line display.

Requirement ID: FS-226491.  
Type: Functional.  
Status: Accepted.  

There is a car auxiliary line display setting item on the HMI. When the user clicks to set it, the MHU will send the signal “MHU_AVM_auxiliarylineReq = request/ no request” to the SVM. After SVM receiving the signal, the SVM will perform the user operation and give the feedback signal “AVM_auxiliarylineSts = request/ norequest” to the MHU. The state of this setting item is memorized by the MHU, and the SVM will synchronize its own signal state according to the MHU signal state each time it is powered on.

The auxiliary line requirements of the car are as follows:
- When the user setting status is off, the auxiliary line will be hidden.  
- When the user setting status bit is turned on, the auxiliary line status will be displayed.  
- The auxiliary line will be adjusted according to the steering wheel angle.

The form requirements of the auxiliary line are as follows:
Page 26
11.4.4.2.6 / Hitch guidance line.

Requirement ID: FS-226492.  
Type: Functional.  
Status: Accepted.

When the vehicle is equipped with a towing hook, the system will have a towing hook guide line, and the user can easily dock the trailer according to this guide line.

There is a hitch guidance line setting item in the rear view interface. The user can set the on/off state of it. When the user clicks to open, the MHU will send a coordinate signal to the SVM, and the SVM will display the hitch guidance line after receiving the user’s request. When the user clicks to close, the MHU will send a coordinate signal to the SVM, and the SVM will close the auxiliary line after receiving the user’s request.

This setting item should be turned off by default, and the driver needs to take the initiative to turn it on.

The form requirements for the hitch guidance line are as follows:
- The width of the guidelines shall be 40 cm wider than the width of the actual vehicle (20 cm on each side).
- There shall be a line indicating 30 cm from the vehicle to indicate the end of the safe zone. This correlates to the solid tone for PDC.
Page 27
11.4.4.2.6 / Hitch guidance line.

Requirement ID: FS-226492.  
Type: Functional.  
Status: Accepted.  

When the vehicle is equipped with a towing hook, the system will display a towing hook guide line, enabling the user to dock the trailer easily with this guide line.  

A hitch guidance line setting feature is available within the rear-view interface. The user can toggle the on/off state of the hitch guidance line. When the user activates this feature, the MHU sends a coordinate signal to the SVM, prompting the SVM to render the hitch guidance line. Conversely, when the user deactivates this functionality, the MHU sends another signal to the SVM to hide the guidance line accordingly.  

By default, the hitch guidance line is in an off state, requiring user initiation to activate it.  

The form requirements for the hitch guidance line are outlined below:  

- The width of the guidelines is 40 cm wider than the vehicle (20 cm on either side).  
- A line indicating 30 cm clearance from the vehicle defines the safe zone's end.  
- Alternate approach trajectory lines are clearly defined, allowing precise docking.

The displayed trajectory line maps back 3 meters, mirroring the standard trajectory lines to ensure consistent safety measures while navigating rear cross-traffic situations.
Page 28
If the SVM receives the left RCTA alarm, the image will display the left alarm. If the SVM receives the right alarm, the image will display the right alarm. If the SVM receives the alarm on both sides, both sides will be displayed.

11.4.4.2.8 / Calibration.

Requirement ID: FS-226494.  
Type: Functional.  
Status: Accepted.  

Each vehicle will have errors during the installation process. In order to compensate for the errors, the SVM system must be calibrated through a special site after the vehicle is off the assembly line, so as to correct the image, so as to better display the various field of view images of the SVM.

### 11.4.4.2.9.2 / Condition 2  

**Requirement ID:** FS-226497  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** Accepted  

In the SVM display interface, if the user dials the left and right turn signals, the SVM interface can jump the display interface to the corresponding viewing angle according to the turn signal, and then the user can manually switch to other interfaces. When the user dials the turn signal again, the interface can still jump automatically.

### 11.4.4.3 / Function Exit  

**Requirement ID:** FS-226498  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** Accepted  

SVM has 3 exit methods: active exit, passive exit, and overspeed exit.  
The exit conditions of SVM are as follows:

#### 11.4.4.3.1 / After the R gear enters the SVM, if the R gear signal disappears, the SVM actively exits;  

**Requirement ID:** FS-226499  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** Accepted

Page 30
11.4.4.3.3 / When the SVM speeds up, the SVM will exit immediately.

**Requirement ID:** FS-226501  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** Accepted  

When SVM actively exits, SVM will send an exit interface request signal "AVM_ShowAVMFdbck = hide" to MHU. The MHU will exit the SVM interface after receiving the signal, and SVM will exit after a delay of 500ms.  

When SVM exits passively, the MHU will send the exit signal "MHU_AVM_ShowAVMReq = hide" to SVM. After receiving the MHU signal, the SVM will send "AVM_ShowAVMFdbck = hide" to the MHU, and the MHU will exit immediately after receiving the SVM signal. The SVM system exits after a delay of 500ms.  

When SVM exits at overspeed, SVM will send an exit request signal "AVM_ShowAVMFdbck = speed limit exceed" to MHU. After receiving the signal, MHU will exit the SVM display interface and display overspeed exit information to the user. When the vehicle speed is lower than 10km/h, SVM will send the signal "AVM_ShowAVMFdbck = show" to the MHU. Upon receiving the signal, the MHU will re-enter the SVM display interface. The SVM will maintain this state until the user manually exits.

**Requirement ID:** FS-226504  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** Accepted  

When the SVM camera fails, if the MHU sends the request signal "MHU_AVM_ShowAVMReq = show" to the SVM, the SVM will send the signals "AVM_Sts = fault" and "AVM_ShowAVMFdbck = show" to let the MHU inform the user that the SVM is not available.
