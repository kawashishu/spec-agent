5.1 Technical requirement.

5.1.1 Project Requirements.

Quality Requirements:  
Please refer to VINFAST “Supplier Quality Statement of Requirements”. The objective of the quality strategy for VinFast vehicles, and all components and systems affecting the total vehicle, is zero defects (no complaints during the average product lifetime) at delivery and when operated by the customer. In order to accomplish this goal, all development and manufacturing processes of all involved companies must be optimized in terms of avoiding defects and ensuring reliability.

The fundamental requirements with regard to quality assurance of the objects of development are to be observed.

Planning of processes and procedures for series supplies shall take into account the requirements of the customer (Purchasing conditions, packaging, and logistic specifications, etc.).

The necessity for providing and using tools and methods for minimizing development and process risks, as well as the responsibilities for this, are agreed upon in the Activity Interface Agreement that accompanies the development contract.

The components are to be laid out such that the functions in connection with and to the adjacent systems are ensured:  
- The system/the component should maintain full functioning capability over a period of at least 10 years or 160,000km, whichever comes first.  
- Should be designed for high-volume production.  
- Be maintenance-free over the vehicle lifetime.  
- Emit no disturbing noises.  
- Be fully functional over 15,000 liftgate open/close cycles.  
- Use standard and common parts where possible and reasonable.

Additional Requirements:  
Refer to: General Engineering Requirements VinFast.

5.1.2 Certification:  
- The certification requirement is to verify the reliability of the product and to simulate 10 years of exposure of the vehicle or 160,000 km of customer service conditions. The successful completion of the certification first depends on the supplier conducting a simulated durability test on the parts or subsystems according to the requirements of VINFAST. The parts provided by the supplier must meet the requirements of VINFAST and issue the corresponding test report.  
- VINFAST is responsible for vehicle-level system integration and certification. Vehicle-level certification programs include urban simulated road testing and enhanced road testing, and component/subsystem suppliers will be responsible for timely response to failure reports found.

Version: 1 

Functional Safety Requirements.

The supplier must ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet the IATF 16949:2016 standard. Cooperation with the VINFAST vehicle safety department is mandatory. Lifetime relevant laws, ratings of selling markets, and OEM requirements must be taken into account.

The safety goals or the set of relevant safety requirements including their assigned ASIL must be clearly defined. If the ASIL is unknown during supplier selection, a conservative assumption can be made. The safety goals, functional safety requirements, and associated attributes must align with this standard.

Safety Goal Requirement:
- FTTI: The attribute of the safety goal determines the safe state.
- ASIL: The attribute of the safety goal defines the safety level.

System Requirement:
Only physical entities (e.g., speed, acceleration, yaw, etc.), as controlled or perceived by the system user, should be specified. These requirements may involve the complete system or a subsystem of the vehicle. Subsystems interacting with other subsystems must mitigate risks such as Distributed Safety Architecture scenarios where vehicle control units (VCU) detect acceleration excursions and shut down electric machine torque during hazardous situations.

- The supplier must provide and/or support any documentation to be submitted to the relevant authorities.

b. Self-certification and test report(s).
Page 20
The supplier is responsible for “self-certifying” their part(s), product(s) or system(s) to meet all applicable FMVSS/CMVSS before those products can be offered for sale. VinFast requests suppliers to conduct tests as specified in certain of the FMVSS/CMVSS. The test report(s) must be provided to VinFast as an evidence of compliance.  

The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that USA/Canada governments use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each FMVSS/CMVSS.  

Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS or European regulations:  
— Notwithstanding its certification of a product, a supplier may subsequently determine that a non-compliance with FMVSS/CMVSS, European regulations or a safety-related defect exists in a motor vehicle equipment item they have produced.  

The supplier has a duty to notify VinFast of such issues within five working days after determining the existence of a non-compliance or a safety-related defect. The supplier must propose an appropriate risk assessment and resolution plan.

The supplier is responsible for ensuring their part(s), product(s) or system(s) meet applicable UN-ECE regulations before those products can be offered for sale.  
VinFast requests the supplier conduct tests as specified in certain UN-ECE regulations at authorized technical services. The test report(s) and/or UN-ECE certificate(s) must be provided to VinFast as evidence of compliance.  

VinFast also requests the supplier provide supporting documentation and technical information, including drawings, to be submitted to the relevant authorities to receive certification for EC vehicle type-approval (if any).  

The supplier should also be familiar with the laboratory test procedures that European authorities use to evaluate the compliance of their products with each corresponding UN-ECE regulation.  

#### c. Duty to notify VinFast of a non-compliance with UN-ECE regulations
