#### Additional Requirements:
n/a.

### Test Plan:
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VINFAST wants verification of test results on its own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST.
Page 20
The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly during the testing phase or if new data/information due to development changes are needed. The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the components rests with the SDS. Testing must be planned timely to ensure approval or re-testing in case of negative results within the committed schedule. The SDS must ensure that VINFAST receives all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VINFAST can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. 

Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VINFAST and SDS. If testing was conducted with incorrect parts, missing parts, or via a different testing procedure, the testing must be repeated at the cost of the SDS. In case of negative test results, re-tests must be re-planned, and the associated costs borne by the SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data must be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with a declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirements.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of the testing set-up with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Location of the testing (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in the form of a project plan).
- Part variant, description of parts.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is required to use the DVP&R template provided by the VINFAST testing department. The content of the DVP&R remains the responsibility of the SDS. The SDS must prepare a DVP for each development stage, including prototypes (if defined in the master timing chart) and the serial stage.

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST. The testing plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VINFAST departments and the SDS. The DVP&R must be approved between the test department SQA (VINFAST) and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. In case of scheduling delays, the SDS must deliver proposals to fulfill the committed timeline.

Upon request, the SDS must prepare a test plan for each single component.

### Testing

#### General
The SDS must prepare a detailed and backdated testing plan in time, considering the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.16). It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested!

To prevent redundant testing, mechanical and electrical tests must be combined as far as possible. Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS must also be stated in the SDS quotation and ordered by the SDS from VINFAST.
Page 21
Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. Parts needed for testing activities at the VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

The SDS must assure compliance with all relevant legislations for their component. Furthermore, they must guarantee that all internal VINFAST requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VINFAST. Additionally, all relevant Vietnamese law obligations must be achieved. 

Tests must be documented according to VINFAST standards, or alternatively, to the SDS standard if accepted by VINFAST. The SDS is responsible for evaluating and performing the tests required during the serial development phase according to the specification. 

The required tests have to be detailed in the attached DVP&R template and provided as an enclosure to the offer. Samples for inspections must be made available in a timely manner, no later than the agreed date (coordinated with the test department). VINFAST Logistics determines the required number of sample parts, and VINFAST Purchase orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. Disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS. 

### Release by Test-Departments
The responsible VINFAST test department will release components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the SDS during complete vehicle integration tests. The SDS must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to the DVP&R. In the case of any problems (e.g., negative test results, incorrect parameters, or processes), the SDS must submit a test report, attend upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions (ensuring all milestones and targets are met). 

An "OK" or "NOK" result must be clearly stated on the first page of the report. 

### Analyses, Test-Reports
The SDS must provide measurement reports that adhere to VINFAST specifications (VFDST00008900) [43] in electronic format, with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts. After individual tests, the test samples must be analyzed in detail.

The measurement and test results must be substantiated with individual values and documented in a test report. The report must then be submitted to the responsible VINFAST department for release.

Upon request, results and documentation of tests performed (e.g., initial sample inspections and inspections conducted during development) must be provided to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests conducted during serial production must also be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.
Page 22
Test-report/-information:
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (part no., change index, materials, production process, additives like grease and every deviation from approved serial process).
- All parts have to be labeled with description.

- Recommendation.
- Description of corrective measures or further approach in case of negative test result.
- Progress of testing status.
- Listing of all tests in a table with responsible person, part status, comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the SDS has to give new date for re-test with countermeasures to VINFAST for approval with responsible person and company to do the test.

The VINFAST test engineer has to be informed in periodic intervals with actual status and progress.  
If VINFAST orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.

Archival storage of tested parts:
Testing parts are only allowed to scrap if VINFAST test department agrees to that. On demand of test engineer, the complete testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.

### Virtual Testing  
Suitable calculation methods are to be used and adequately detailed calculation models created by the SDS for securing, verifying, and effectively optimizing the component properties defined in the technical specification, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations. The requirements related to the mechanical properties of the component, in particular such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, are to be secured by means of FEM calculations.  

The tool dimensioning for the injection molding has to be optimized by corresponding simulations. On request, the operative calculation models representing the respective development status are to be made available at any time to the requesting technical departments of VINFAST for internal calculations and integration work.  

On request from VINFAST, the SDS has to provide suitable FEM models without extra cost.  
The tests from the SDS, according to the evaluation plan, must be calculatively documented (e.g. FEM) before the tool dimensioning.  

Basically, no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range are allowed. In particular, the behavior has to be kept stable when using materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients.  

The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.  

These component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed upon between VINFAST and the SDS and will be binding.  

If VINFAST orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.  
Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST's test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.  

### Geometrical Integration  
RPS (reference position system): The classification of the testing range occurs in a functional area. The objective of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts.  
An RPS-concept for the design has to be completed with quality assurance in the SE-process.  

The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to occur within the RPS-system VFDST00000011 [34], according to the interior and BIW department.
Page 24
Tolerance analyses: Following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms.
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.

Arrangements are necessary in order to ensure the required gap dimension of components.

**Clearance Wiring Harness:**
