Strength. Refer to DVP DVPRXNDCL1603 and SOR VFSRXNDCL1508 for strength requirements, test procedures, and acceptance criteria such as resistance to abrasion from textiles using a crock meter, abrasion with wetted textile, and climate testing. Elastomers standards include VFDST00010602 and VFDST00010603, with determination of the specific volume resistance of elastomers, plastics, and adhesives according to DIN IEC 62631-3-1. Scratch resistance of TPE and EPDM surfaces must follow VFDST00032302 and VFDST00032309, while anti-friction coating adhesion adheres to DIN EN ISO 2409, paragraph 8. Mounting/dismounting requirements comply with VFDST00009000.

Durability/Fatigue. Refer to DVP DVPRXNDCL1603 for elongation after heat storage, condensation water constant temperature, climate testing under constant condensation water atmosphere, xenon-test according to the Florida mode, and more.

Durability/Impact. Information not applicable.

Durability/Corrosion. Refer to DVP DVPRXNDCL1603 and SOR VFSRXNDCL1508 for requirements such as resistance to abrasion from textiles using a crock meter and abrasion with wetted textile.
