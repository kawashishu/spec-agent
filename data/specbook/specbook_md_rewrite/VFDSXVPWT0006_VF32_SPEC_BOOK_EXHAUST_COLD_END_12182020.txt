5.1.1 System description.

A Exhaust Cold End. The original equipment typically reduces the noise level from the tailpipe by bouncing sound waves off the back, front, and sides of the muffler.  
They are designed to meet the maximum allowable noise level required by government regulations. However, some original equipment mufflers are significant sources of back pressure. These mufflers consist of an inner perforated tube, an outer solid tube, and fiberglass sound insulation between the two tubes. They often have less back pressure than original equipment mufflers but are relatively ineffective at reducing sound levels.  
Another common type of muffler is the chambered muffler, which consists of a series of concentric or eccentric pipes inside the expansion chamber cavity. These pipes allow sound to travel into them and cause the sound waves to bounce off the closed, flat ends of the pipe. These reflections partially cancel each other out, reducing the sound level.  

Resonators are sections of pipe that expand to a larger diameter and allow the sound waves to reflect off the walls and cancel out, thereby reducing noise levels. Resonators should be used as separate components in an exhaust system.

**Package layout overview:**  
The complete vehicle is still under development. Use dimensions provided as references to confirm technical feasibility and provide initial quotations. More accurate dimensions/envelops will be provided once available.  
The system designer must coordinate all components of the module concerning packaging, function, fixing, and tolerances.  
Exhaust Cold End must be located after the Exhaust Hot End system for the circuit to work most effectively. The Exhaust Cold End must be leak-proof to prevent the loss of gases. Mufflers claim to increase engine output and/or reduce fuel consumption by slightly reduced back pressure, though this may result in less noise reduction.

#### 5.1.1 System Description
The Exhaust Cold End equipment reduces noise from the tailpipe by reflecting sound waves through muffler components:
- **Government compliant:** Designed to meet maximum allowable noise levels while reducing sound through perforated tubes, fiber glass insulation, and chambered mufflers.
- **Noise cancellation:** Leveraging concentric or eccentric pipes and resonators to allow sound reflections that diminish noise levels.

**Package Layout Overview:**
- Modular component design accounts for packaging, function, fixing, and tolerances.
- Exhaust Cold End follows the Exhaust Hot End system to ensure effective circuit operation.
- Focuses on leak-proof construction to avoid gas loss and claims to reduce engine back pressure, which may result in less noise reduction.

##### **CAD Images**
A CAD image provides a visualization of the Exhaust Cold End system. Dimensions are ICE application-based, aiming for compact, low-cost designs of acceptable quality:
- **Cold-end connecting pipe diameter:** 70mm
- **Tailpipe diameter:** 55mm

#### NVH and Driving Comfort
The system is designed to prevent anomalous noise, abnormal sounds, and vibrational problems under all working conditions.

5.1.2 Function  
The purpose of the exhaust system is to transport exhaust gases (emissions) from the engine combustion process to the rear of the vehicle, reduce engine combustion exhaust gas noise to legal levels, and maintain exhaust back pressure within a specified limit. It will also manage internal and external sounds levels and sound quality according to vehicle specifications.  

The Exhaust System is a functional subsystem dedicated to managing:  
- Exhaust cold-end backpressure  
- Noise and performance characteristics  

### Required Simulation Analysis:  
- **Engine Simulation (1-D Gas Dynamics):** The engine supplier department will facilitate modeling of the exhaust system development by working closely with the supplier. While the department won't release the engine model to third parties, it will provide the output data required for exhaust system design in the requested format.  
- **CFD analysis:** Analysis for the Exhaust System Module focusing on 3-D Gas Dynamics.  
- **NVH analysis:** Analysis of sound, backpressure, and acoustic elements for the Exhaust System Module.  
- **Vibration and Thermal FE Analysis:** Examination focused on hanger stiffness and local stiffness of the mufflers.  
- **Design & Process FMEA:** Cold-end exhaust back pressure requirement shall remain below <300 mbar at 670 kg/h exhaust gas mass flow.  

5.1.3 System Requirements  
In ICE applications, Exhaust Cold End must include two tailpipes for optimal performance.  
The system requirements include:  
- **Geometry**  
- **Acoustics, vibrations, resonances**  
- **Durability** to suit the operational profile  
- **Serviceability and ease of repair**

Page 12
5 Description and Scope of Work

5.1 Technical Requirement  
The components must meet technical specifications and operational conditions.

5.1.4 Interfaces.  
The components must be designed to ensure functionality in combination with adjoining systems and interfaces. 
Major interface points include:
- Powertrain for packaging, function, and connection to the exhaust system hot end.
- BIW (Body in White) for clearances, packaging, resonances, and stiffness.
- Exterior Parts, such as rear bumpers and underbody heat shields.
- Chassis components including clearance to fuel system, braking system, and rear axle system piping.
- Complete vehicle performance targets.
- Control systems like throttle control.

Extreme environmental variations must be considered:
- Temperatures from -50°C to +950°C.
- Corrosive conditions including exhaust condensates and road salt exposure.
- High internal pressure fields and extreme accelerations during scenarios like crash or full ABS braking.
The design must accommodate road-load conditions, reckless driving, or off-road scenarios.

Critical interfaces include:
- The hot end flange.
- Rear exhaust suspension points.

DVP and PC test responsibilities follow the RASIC model. Testing should align with System, Sub-system, and Component-Level specifications in the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase. Detailed test plans for hardware tests are outlined in file DVP&R and require collaboration with the Testing & Validation department. Key considerations include:  
- Testing with declarations of standard, norm, and legal requirements.  
- Description of test setup with pictures detailing the devices employed.  
- Location of testing (internal or external).  
- Timeline of testing activities (specified in a project plan).  
- Part variants and descriptions.  
- Number of tested components or parts.
