The purpose of these NVH pads is to absorb airborne noise to aid improved NVH performance of the vehicle. NVH pads are part of the functional black commodities on the VFe34S model. 

The noise test needs to be performed at the alpha cabin, and it will generate the performance chart of sound absorption coefficient across various frequencies, as shown in the figure below. The results need to be confirmed by the NVH engineer.

**Figure Description:** The chart illustrates the sound absorption coefficient per SAE standards, measured across frequency bands spanning from low to high frequencies. The coefficient shows peak absorption in the middle frequency range and gradually decreases at higher frequencies.
