The Contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements. Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details must be reported immediately. The contractor is a "System Development Supplier," with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

2.2 Initial Situation and Objective.
The system is planned for use in various vehicle models, for various country-specific packages, and for various combinations of optional equipment. Adaptation of system functions to a given vehicle shall be accomplished by modular component population of the necessary modules and coding via the diagnostics interface. The design of the amplifier shall avoid noise generation like squeak and rattle, as well as noise generation due to the moving parts. Furthermore, the electronic shall be designed to work without a fan or external cooling under the required temperature conditions.

2.3 Classification of the System / Component.
Amplifier, electronic appliance.

2.4 Execution Regulations.
International general electronic standard.

2.5 Development and Supply Scope.

Refer to 5.3.12.18. Can messages.

5.3.2.12 Thermal Protection  
The amplifier includes thermal protection functionality. Overheating causes the amplifier to automatically shut down. After a cooling period, the amplifier resumes normal operation. The characteristic curve of this function is defined between the customer and supplier. 

- If the temperature exceeds 150°C, the power IC reduces output.  
- If the temperature consistently exceeds 150°C for a prolonged interval, the power IC shuts down automatically.  
- AMP polls power IC every 30 seconds. If temperature >150°C, AMP decreases gain by 2dB.  
- If temperature >150°C for 10 consecutive polls, AMP mutes itself.

Detailed actions:  
1. In case of short-circuits in one or more loads, the external amplifier activates automatic protection and restores normal operation immediately upon resolution.  
2. Partial short-circuits trigger protection and restore normal operation after resolution.  
3. Open loads pose no risk of damage for the amplifier.  
4. Overheating invokes automatic protection mode.

Refer to CES_VINFAST_EE_VFDSP50000008_Thermal_Management_V10.0 and CTS_VINFAST_EE_VFDSP50000009_Thermal_Management_V1.0.0 for documentation.

5.3.2.13 Voltage Over/Lower Protection  
The amplifier has safeguards for abnormal power supply voltages.

- Lower voltage threshold: If power supply voltage falls below 7.9V (down to 6V), amplifier enters standby mode.  
- Over voltage threshold: If power supply voltage exceeds 16V, amplifier mutes itself. For voltage >20.5V, the amplifier enters standby mode.

Voltage | System State  
<7.9V -> 6V | Standby  
8-9V | Mute  
9-16V | Normal  
16-20V | Mute  
>20.5V | Standby

### 5.8 Safety Requirements

#### 5.8.1 Vehicle Safety regarding Person and Passenger Protection

##### 5.8.1.1 Safety Goals  
**General Requirements**  
The supplier is responsible to actively support the integration of vehicle safety functions. Lifetime relevant laws and ratings of selling markets as well as OEM requirements must be taken into account.

#### 5.8.2 Vehicle Safety
Not applicable.

### 5.9 Alternative and Future Variants
Not applicable.

### 5.10 Mechanical Energy Management

#### 5.10.1 Weight Targets  
Because the vehicle weight is a big influence to the energy consumption of the vehicle, the major goal of the weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight.  

Throughout the whole development, attention must be paid on a weight-optimized design of all components. All weight reduction potentials have to be shown by the supplier, also with their impact to cost, timing, quality, etc.

#### 5.10.2 Fuel Consumption & Driving Performance
Not applicable.

### 5.11 Installation

#### 5.11.1 Installation Location  
**Vehicle Architecture**  
The complete vehicle must pass the requirements from the vehicle layout plans. All changes on parts and modules, which are affecting the vehicle layout dimensions or geometric coherence of the vehicle, have to be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.  

The definition and technical geometric specification regarding complete vehicle dimensions in interior and exterior are based on GCIE 2016 measurement definitions.

5.12 Styling and Design.
**Styling Technique Convergence.**
All changes on parts and modules, which are affecting the Exterior and/or Interior styling surfaces of the vehicle, have to be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.

Part or system-related technical input requirements for styling evolution loops have to be provided from the supplier (e.g., tooling demands, assembly sequence), based on defined requirements from VinFast module leads. Technical input can be provided e.g., as office documents, 3D CAD data, or sections.

5.13 Ergonomics.

5.13.1 Optical Characteristics and Surface Feel.
NA.

5.13.2 Actuation Acoustics.
**Actuation Noises.**
The sound of actuation noises must not be audible respectively representing a high-quality impression integrated into the complete vehicle. Noises perceived by the customers as unpleasant are to be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, and foaming.

The requirements are to be performed in all specified environmental and thermic conditions (temperatures from -30°C to +85°C and relative humidity from 10% to 95%). During serial manufacturing, a capable quality assurance process has to be established to ensure the quality level.

The supplier has to provide components for testing and NVH tuning and ensure the participation of specialists during local testing and troubleshooting processes.
Page 33
### 5.13 Handling

**Ergonomics**  
The complete vehicle must pass the ergonomic tests based on VinFast internal procedure. All dimensional and material changes that affect ergonomics on parts and modules have to be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation.  

All main ergonomic targets (e.g., ingress/egress, seating layout, armrest positions, steering wheel position, roominess definition) are derived by benchmark analysis.  

The final sign-off of all ergonomic targets will be done in close cooperation with VinFast, which is responsible for interior and exterior styling. VinFast ultimately approves targets by evaluations using the styling bucks.

Recycling Scheme.  
This section establishes the general project-wide requirements for the recycling and repair of components in development.
Page 36
5.16 Environmental Compatibility.

**Design for Recycling of Parts and Components.**  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at the end of life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  
The recycling scheme has to be provided to environmental experts team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

**Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization.**  
To ensure a cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided via the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:  
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks/check of deployment per component).  
- After deployment of pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that would classify, according to valid waste legislation, as toxic waste or hazardous substances. Otherwise, the components shall be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances.  
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle/via feedback at the deployment tool).  
- Mark positions of pyrotechnical components (especially “hidden” components, e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest).  
- In case of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is required. If technically possible, pre-dismantling shall be avoided (accessibility of fasteners).  

**Eco-Design.**  
**Parts Marking.**  
Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, consisting of mathematical signs for "more than" (>) and "less than" (<).  

**Lifecycle Analysis.**  
Not applicable.  

**Emissions & Toxicology.**  
**Harmful Substances in Components and Materials.**  
The emission behavior of the E/E product with direct contact to the interior compartment has to be checked on representative components as soon as possible.  
Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment have to be minimized. Required measurements for confirmation of emission characteristics must be performed by the supplier in agreement with the specialist department of VinFast.  

The measurements must be conducted at testing institutes approved by VinFast. Suppliers should obtain a list of approved testing institutes from VinFast. Additional project-specific requirements can be found in related documents, such as the Emission Guideline.
Page 37
5.17 Mechanical Requirements

5.17.1 Load.

**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast.  
The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in Chapter 5.18.  

**Special events:**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.  

**Misuse events:**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned so that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations. Either to the same or neighboring components (principle "deformation before break").

5.17.2 Vibration Behavior.

**NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior:**  
The maximum vibration level is to be defined by the supplier (brackets must be developed to avoid resonances below a certain frequency).  
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 35Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VinFast. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in Chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.  

5.17.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics.  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.
Page 38
### 5.17 Mechanical Requirements

#### 5.17.4 Deformation  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

#### 5.17.5 Pressure  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

#### 5.17.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance

**Fan**  
If the electrical control unit contains cooling fans, no tonal frequency bands are acceptable (adjacent bars must not exceed 3dB).

**Audio Acoustics**  
Leakage and rattle-free mounting of the speakers must be possible through a wide basket mounting interface with a foam ring attached to the basket or rigid basket material. The basket front side must allow a sealed connection to the speaker grille via a flat surface or foam ring attachment.  

The component must remain stable over time. No deformation, shrinkage, or degradation due to temperature, moisture, dirt, UV radiation, or other environmental factors is allowed. Adhesives must maintain specified adhesion, particularly for the components such as the membrane, suspension, voice coil, dust cap, and membrane glue.

**S&R, General**  
Noises perceived by customers as disturbing must be ruled out through appropriate material selection, surface treatment, gap optimization, and forming. The supplier is required to ensure that components will not produce disturbing noises within their vehicle environment under geometrical and climatic integration.  

No squeak or rattle noises are permissible due to excitation of the body through wind, torsional flexing, relative surface movements, or environmental conditions over the component's service life. Testing requirements must be coordinated with the responsible testing team to ensure noise freedom.  

The supplier must support the development of vibration and acoustic behavior, ensuring constant acoustic quality of the subsystem delivered under real-world testing scenarios. Components for comparison, tuning, and evaluation must be provided free of charge as needed.
