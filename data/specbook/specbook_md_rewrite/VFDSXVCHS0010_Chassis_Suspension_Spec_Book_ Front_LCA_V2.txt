### 11 Production Quality  

#### 11.1 In Process Testing  
In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuing improvement. Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan. When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked.

The table below summarizes the various IP tests and the acceptance parameters for each. They form the basis to develop a complete Control Plan for these and their related significant process characteristics. The Control Plan will include frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.

**Table of Tests**  
- Refer DVP for all tests:  
  - Material Test.  
  - Environmental Test.  
  - Component/System Level Testing.  

#### 11.2 Visual Inspection  
All parts will be 100% inspected in the formed condition, after heat treatment, and after machining at the time of packing. No surface defects (cracks, notches, malformed areas, etc.) are allowed. These allowable surface defect standards should be made available to the appropriate inspectors and operators at the various manufacturing facilities. The following applies to all surfaces unless otherwise noted.  

#### 11.3 Dimensional Control  
The production supplier has ultimate responsibility to write the Control Plan and to identify significant characteristics (SC) over and above the significant and critical (SC, CC/) features identified by VinFast. The production supplier is also responsible to establish initial Process Control and ongoing process capability reporting per VinFast requirements.  

The Control Plan will:
- Identify those features requiring process capability.  
- Establish process capability from 30 randomly sampled pieces.

### 11.3 Dimensional Control  

The production supplier is responsible for writing the Control Plan and identifying significant characteristics (SC) beyond those outlined by VinFast, including significant and critical features (SC, CC/). 

Key responsibilities include:
1. Establishing initial Process Control and ongoing capability reporting as per VinFast requirements.
2. Process capability must be demonstrated using at least 30 randomly selected pieces taken from a continuous production run of a minimum of 300 pieces.
3. Meeting AIAG PPAP edition 4 requirements with capability data included in PPAP documentation.

For ongoing control:
- X-bar and R charts must be applied unless VinFast ATI1 specifically waives this requirement. 
- Acceptance of parts through sampling plans or statistical procedures does not absolve the supplier from ensuring all parts meet purchase order requirements and component prints.

If defects are identified during in-process sampling plans:
- The supplier must implement the reaction plan specified in the Control Plan. 

VinFast ATI1 departmental requirements for process capability numbers (Cp, Cpk, etc.) may supersede any standard guidelines. 

A **documented fail-safe system** must be approved and operational within all applicable facilities. This system ensures the permanent removal of any non-compliant subframes from the production flow, particularly in operations involving:
- Sheet metal fabrication
- Heat treating 
- Machining 
- Final assembly

12.3 Surface.

12.3.1 Surface condition.
Component parts are to be further processed to be free of burrs (≤ 0.3 mm as per DIN ISO 13715) and without chips. The requirements as per subsection 2.5.3 apply to the rear axle carrier assembly (before paint finishing). The paint application is to be inspected on the finished part in accordance with subsection 12.3.2. Tool-related markings or defects are permitted up to a depth of 0.3 mm. Minimum wall thicknesses shall not be fallen short of; function shall not be impaired.

12.3.2 Surface treatment.

12.3.2.1 Requirements.

**General Requirements.**
VFDST00003500 shall be applied for the pretreatment and cathodic dip painting of steel components. A continuous processing time of the components shall be met via the total processing time in the pre-treatment and painting unit. There shall not be any subdivision of the processing time over the whole production process due to the risk of basic material corrosion. If this requirement is not adhered to, suitable measures shall be taken to prevent basic material corrosion within the storage time. Verifications to this effect shall be documented.

**Surface State of the Developing Article According to the Pre-treatment Processes, i.e., Before Coating.**
After the pre-treatment processes there may be no residues (e.g., branded oils/lubricants) present on the surface which negatively affect subsequent processes. A check can be made, for example, in accordance with the ASTM standard (water breaking test). Silicate and smoke residues (scaling) and impurities in front and back areas around the welding seams as well as the heat-affected zones must be removed sufficiently to enable the formation of an all-over phosphate layer.

**Phosphating.**
Subsequently, a phosphate surface coat with a coating weight of 5 ±3 g/m² shall be applied to internal surfaces, to external surfaces and to welding seams. For hollow profiles, an immersion process is absolutely required. Thick-layer cathodic dip painting with edge optimization is applied. Coating: as per drawing. The following coating thicknesses must adhere to the specified values:

| Coating Location   | Minimum Thickness | Target Thickness | Maximum Thickness |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Outside            | 35 μm            | 40 μm           | 50 μm            |
| Inside             | 20 μm            | -                | -                |
| Edges              | 8 μm             | -                | -                |

The maximum thickness for external surfaces only applies to the bolting areas marked according to the drawing. Minimum paint coat thickness at the edges shall be verified. Burrs must meet VDI guideline 2906 sheet 1 and sheet 2. There shall not be any defective e-coating locations (e.g., due to missing ventilation holes, output holes, and coating holes). e-coating contact points shall be placed such that they are later covered in the assembly.

**E-coating Drying at Object Temperature.**
Minimum: 165 °C and 15-minute baking duration.
Maximum: 200 °C and 10-minute baking duration.
For details, see the e-coating supplier baking window. The e-coating paint shall be fully cured.

12.5.3 Testing.

a) Visual inspection.  
The individual welds are to be examined by means of visual inspection in accordance with the requirements under subsection 12.5.2 (characteristics for external examination results). Faulty welds can be rewelded (see subsection 12.5.4).  

b) Macrosection.  
The assessment of characteristics for penetration and internal examination results of the weld seams in accordance with subsection 12.5.2 is carried out by means of macrosections; cutting levels according to released weld drawing (Page 2).  

12.5.4 Reworking of defects.  
If parts are singled out during visual inspection (see subsection 12.5.3) that, with respect to external examination results of the welds (inadequate weld, varying leg size, undercutting, end crater pores), are not carried out with weld quality in accordance with the assessment groups in the drawing as per DIN EN 25 817 or with the deviations permitted according to the drawing, these can be manually rewelded by trained welders or by automated means while adhering to the following criteria:

**Weld preparation:**  
- In the event the first weld is interrupted, the seam ends and beginnings of the defects are to be partially ground. Other weld defects are to be removed. Grinding of the base material is not permitted.

**Rewelding:**  
a) Only one rewelding operation is permitted per weld. In the case of surface pores, a second reworking operation by means of manual welding is possible in exceptional cases.  
b) Rewelding must correspond to all requirements according to the drawing and this standard in terms of the welding technique and also the external and internal examination results of the weld.  
c) The drawing dimensions (geometry), with the exception of the "a" dimension, must lie within the dimension tolerances after rewelding.  
d) The bond to the first weld or to the base material must be ensured.
