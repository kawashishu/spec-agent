### Material Requirements & Corrosion
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation.

#### Determination of Corrosion Requirements
The corrosivity position needs to be classified for each system component:

1. **Corrosivity Low**: 
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium**:
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

3. **High Corrosivity**:
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very High Corrosivity**:
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

#### Vehicle Exterior Corrosivity
The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations must be chosen to prevent galvanic corrosion. This requirement applies to fasteners and attached brackets, and when a critical material combination exists, proper coating (e.g. paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers) must be added.

#### Design Considerations
- Avoid water and dirt accumulation; always provide drainage at the lowest positions.
- Avoid dirt traps where sand can act as an abrasive and damage the painted body due to micro movements.
- Contact surfaces to the body shall:
  - Be dry.
  - Be large enough for low pressure.
  - Be made of non-abrasive material.
- Minimize micro-movement.

---
Page 15
Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of more than 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, allowing moisture to enter.

Prevention of stone chipping issues:
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized through design measures:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help prevent severe issues.
- Use part materials and paint in high stone-hitting risk areas with the same color to avoid visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them to prevent stones from easily hitting them.

Test Plan:
The test plan regulates who and when the testing will be done and specifies necessary testing devices. The plan must show the results visually and the progress of testing. Controlling the test results must be ensured continuously. If VinFast demands verification of test results, the SDS is required to deliver the necessary parts free of charge.

Test procedures and documentation must be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. The test plan must be updated weekly or when new data/information due to development changes is required.

The SDS is responsible for the complete safeguarding of their component. Testing must be planned to ensure approval or re-testing in case of negative results. The SDS must provide VinFast with all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and allow VinFast to attend testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures must be agreed upon between VinFast and the SDS.

If testing is conducted using incorrect, missing parts, or with a different testing procedure, the testing must be repeated at the SDS's expense. In the event of negative test results, testing must be re-planned, and the retesting costs will be covered by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

Following data must be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with a declaration of standard, norm, or legal requirement.
- Description of testing, including setup details and pictures.
- Responsible test department.
- Location of testing (internal/external).
- Duration and timeline of testing (provided in project plan).
- Part variant and a description of the part.
Page 16
No. of tested components/parts.

The DVP&R has to be agreed between the T&V (VinFast), SQA (VinFast), and the SDS before concept confirmation. After this concept confirmation, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delays, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule. Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.

Any failure of tests conducted by VF will lead to root cause analysis. If the root cause originates from the supplier, the supplier must take full responsibility, and VF will support closing the issues. Suppliers are free to attend centralized tests.

### 3.3 General CAE Requirements
VFSRXXCVC0201  
VFCAE-001-FEM-GENERAL_Analysis requirement.

### 3.4 Material Requirement
Assemblies and components must be developed to facilitate economical recycling at the end of the vehicle’s life. It is the supplier's responsibility to prepare a recycling concept. Only approved materials for each application from the European automobile industry may be used.

### 3.5 Traceability
For part requirements, follow specifications outlined in VinFast standard VFDST00010501.

### 3.6 Labeling of Parts
Suppliers must adhere to VinFast standard VFDST00000010. They are required to provide labels with positioning figures (setup with pictures).

### 4 Testing and Validation and DVP&R
Testing and validation responsibilities follow the RASIC model. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for System, Sub-system & Component Level must align with the Complete Vehicle Specification Book during the concept phase. 

#### Detailed Test Plan Requirements:

### 12 Appearance Approval Process
The Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is applicable by suppliers to supply components affecting CMF appearance that require VinFast Approval prior to PPAP deliverables. This report verifies that the VinFast Design Quality has inspected the final product and it meets all the required appearance specifications for the design. Harmony review is significantly important to ensure the component's quality or state of being homogeneous with adjacent parts.

Design Quality requires all suppliers to submit non-commercial value sample parts. Suppliers are required to submit complete assembly parts known as purchase parts (P-level) and child parts known as component parts (D-level). The quantity parts to be submitted are as follows. Refer to VFDST00038401 for details.
