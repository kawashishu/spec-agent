Painting.

The secondary surface can, in principle, be painted, but a dedicated analysis and control of the different possible categories of paintings is mandatory to avoid significant performance degradation.

In general, the secondary surface will carry several layers of primer, paint, and varnishes. These layers, in combination with the structural material, will influence both surface reflection properties and the transmission damping.

All kinds of metallic materials prevent or degrade sensor radiation and shall not be used as a second surface.

Elements containing metallic particles must be verified. The applicability of metallic paintings is dependent on:
- The metal content (percentage) in the painting.
- The size and shape of the metal particles in the painting.
- Number and thickness of different layers of paintings and primers.

Material requirements:

- Materials parts marking: Material marking should be present on CAD.
  - Vehicle plastic components and materials having a weight of more than 100 grams and vehicle elastomer components and materials having a weight of more than 200 grams must be marked in accordance with the EU directives on end-of-life vehicles (2000/53/EC, 2003/138/EC) and the Law for Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources to promote their recovery, reuse, and recycling. This standard does not apply to tires.
  - For the labeling and identification of vehicle plastic components and materials having a weight of more than 100 grams, the following nomenclature applies:
    - ISO 1043-1 Plastics - symbols and abbreviated terms. Part 1: Basic polymers and their special characteristics.
    - ISO 1043-2 Plastics - symbols and abbreviated terms. Part 2: Fillers and reinforcing materials.
    - ISO 11469 Plastics - Generic identification and marking of plastic products.
  - For the labeling and identification of vehicle elastomer components and materials having a weight of more than 200 grams, the following nomenclature applies:
    - ISO 1629 Rubbers and latices - Nomenclature. This shall not apply to the labeling of tires.

- Materials Compliance: 100% of IMDS must be delivered (preliminarily accepted).

Other legal requirements to be considered:
- Annex I of Regulation (EC) No.1272/2008 of the European Parliament and Council of 16th December 2008.
- ELV Directive 2000/53/EC: Materials and components for cars and small vans must not contain cadmium, lead, mercury, or hexavalent chromium, unless covered by a specific exemption in Annex II of the ELV Directive 2000/53/EC.
- Directive 2011/65/EU on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RHOS).
- Directive on Waste 2008/98/EC: Regulation (EC) No.1907/2006 on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH): To exclude chemicals with serious and often irreversible effects on health or the environment.
- Directive on Waste 2008/98/EC: Regulation (EC) No.1005/2009 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (ODS). The protocol covers around 100 individual substances with high ozone-depleting potential (ODP), including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride (CTC), and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA).
