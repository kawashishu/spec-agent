VINFAST aims to develop two main vehicle configurations including Front-Wheel Drive (FWD), which uses a Primary EDS in the front, and All-Wheel Drive (AWD), which uses an additional Assistant EDS in the rear. 

Generally, Primary EDS indicates the EDS with higher output power while Assistant EDS refers to smaller output power EDS. However, EDS with smaller output power is also used as Primary EDS in certain vehicle configurations.

Below is level 2 and 3 of Vinfast Bill of Materials (BoM) and Part Numbers (P/N):

Detail BoM with usage per car will be defined once detail design commences. The EDS BoM shall include information under the following columns:

### N Functions and Requirements  

#### Over temperature protection  
- **Requirement:**  
The DCU shall monitor its temperature during ASC and in case of over-temperature, switch off the function and inform the VCU.  
- **Remark:**  
This can be requested by the VCU or DCU when there is a severe error. In this state, the IGBT is short-circuited to generate no voltage due to the rotating E-Motor but as a result leads to some drag torque.  

#### VCU Communication  
- **Requirement:**  
DCU shall send the status of the active short circuit to VCU as:  
  - ASC NOT ACTIVE.  
  - ASC ACTIVE.  
  - ASC ACTIVATION ERRORS.  
  - In the case of high EDS temperature, ASC cannot be done anymore.

#### Oscillation Amplitude  
- **Requirement:**  
The maximum allowed amplitude of oscillation of EDS (output shaft) shall be TBD (@8Hz) & TBD (@15Hz).  

#### Activation/Deactivation  
- **Requirement:**

#### Frequency Counteraction  
- **Requirement:**  
The DCU shall try to counteract powertrain frequencies (typ. range between 8Hz & 15Hz) that are very unpleasant for occupants and which don't have an oscillation node at the location of the DCU.  

#### Torque Counteraction to Vehicle Targets  
- **Requirement:**  
The DCU shall provide oscillatory counteracting torque below a frequency of TBD Hz, so that the vehicle targets for acceleration oscillation of less than TBD m/s² (first acceleration oscillation peak) can be met.  

#### Torque Counteraction to Powertrain Targets  
- **Requirement:**  
The DCU shall provide oscillatory counteracting torque below a frequency of TBD Hz, so that the Power Train targets for torque oscillations of less than TBD Nm (peak-to-peak, first oscillation swing) can be met.  

#### Amplitude Damping Rate  
- **Requirement:**  
The oscillation amplitude shall be damped by 90% in less than 5 oscillations (i.e., 5 half-periods), compared to the case where no damping is applied via DCU.  

#### Enable/Disable  
- **Requirement:**  
The VCU shall have the option to enable and disable this function. This function shall be controllable via communication network (torque, speed gradients).  

---

#### General Note:  
The Anti-Jerk function will be deactivated for specific driver-requested maneuvers (e.g., Tip-In) to improve response time and for all interventions from ESP / ABS systems.
