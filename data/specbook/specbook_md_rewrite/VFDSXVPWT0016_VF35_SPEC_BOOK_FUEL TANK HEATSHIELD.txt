#### 5 Description and Scope of Work

##### 5.1 Technical Requirement
The fuel tank heatshield must provide adequate heat protection to the fuel tank. Heatshield design and material must prevent temperatures exceeding 60°C on fuel tank surfaces. 

The current package provides a 35 mm clearance between the fuel tank surface and the exhaust pipe. The supplier must nominate a heatshield geometry that allows for a 10 mm clearance to the fuel tank surface. Refer to the following sections for more details.
Page 7
5.2 Component description.
The component is visually illustrated in various views, showing the fixing points on the fuel tank, heat shield geometry, and current heat shield clearance scenarios. The diagrams include:
- Two fixing points placed on the fuel tank at strategic locations for proper stability.
- A detailed view of the heat shield design with dimensions, notably showing a 10 mm clearance to the fuel tank surface and a 25 mm clearance with the exhaust pipe.
- Heat shield materials depicted with annotations on temperature management, ensuring no more than 60°C on the fuel tank surface.
- A visualization of the exhaust pipe's proximity in relation to the fuel tank, ensuring thermal safety constraints.

5.3 General CAE Requirements.
Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL for detailed specifications on computational analysis and finite element modeling requirements.

5.4 Material requirement.
- **Prohibited or Restricted Substances, Emissions & Toxicology:** Suppliers must ensure conformance to prohibited and restricted substances through the entire product lifecycle. All parts (new, carry-over, off-the-shelf, and spare) must comply with the specified guidelines.
- **IMDS Material Data Sheets:** Submission through VinFast’s IMDS ID must adhere to the specifications outlined in the VinFast IMDS Guideline and VFDST00007601 standards.
- **Indoor Air Quality:** Specific targets for vehicle indoor air quality must be achieved according to the VFDSXVCVC3401-VIAQ_Testing_Guideline.
