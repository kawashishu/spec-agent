### **3.3 Fundamental requirements**
The requirements and set aims for the component are described in detail in this specification. The components are designed by the supplier taking into account all basic requirements of the complete vehicle and the assemblies.  

This refers in particular to:  
- Installation tests with relevant tolerance considerations.  
- Fitting and ease of fitting.  
- Ease of maintenance.  
- Optical matching with panel parts (interior and exterior).  
- Environmental friendliness.  
- Country variations and the use of modular systems.  

The Supplier may put forward their own proposals, stating risks and potential, for meeting the customer’s functionality and quality demands at the lowest cost. If the Supplier cannot fulfill the provided base requirements or gains this knowledge during the development process, the Supplier must immediately inform DESIGN PARTNER and VINFAST with clarity.  

The Supplier must take into consideration and showcase cost and weight-saving measures throughout the development period. Existing supplier components must be used as far as practical. Special attention must be given to keeping the design of all non-essential customer-relevant components at a very low cost level.  

**The Cinch System Objective:**  
The Cinch system performs the action to open and close the door with a defined movement.  

**Key Fundamental Requirements:**  
- The door cinch system must be designed to be maintenance-free.
Page 15
• Electrical actuation of the system.  
• Emergency release (mechanical).
