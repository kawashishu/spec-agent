### Target Ambient Light Size
As per styling requirements, the maximum width of ambient light is not more than 7.4mm, and the light guide diameter is limited to 4mm. Surrounding parts such as the cockpit or door panel are wrapped with soft material that compresses to follow the ambient light profile. Meeting the target size is compulsory.

---

### Target Illumination
Homogenous light with a center illumination intensity of 30 ± 5 cd/m² is required, based on the ambient light illumination test range.

---

### Target Effects
A minimum of three lighting effects must be provided. The proposed effects require VinFast approval.

#### Door Open Warning (DOW)
The individual door ambient light can issue a warning when the passenger or driver opens a door while a vehicle approaches from behind. This warning is indicated by a red color blinking effect. The blinking rate and brightness progressively increase to reach maximum intensity based on the approaching vehicle's distance. Detailed functional requirements must be separately communicated with VinFast E/E to ensure BCM compatibility.
Page 10
Color Control Via Color Wheel or Pre-programmed Selection.
BCM can send information to the LED Module regarding RGB coordinates or XY, allowing colors to be illuminated based on the color selected by the user on the color wheel. Alternatively, a minimum of 16 pre-programmed colors can be selected by the user. Detailed functional requirements must be communicated separately with VF E/E to meet BCM requirements.

Brightness Control.
BCM can send information to the LED Module regarding brightness levels ranging from 0% to 100%. Detailed functional requirements must be communicated separately with VF E/E to meet BCM requirements.

General Items.

Assembly.
The values will be evaluated during the initiation phase. End of Line (EOL) testing is required to check lighting functions.

Wire Harness/Main Connector.
OEM-free components must be used at the connections on both the lamp connector and the car connector. All wiring and electronics must adhere to VF Common Electrical Specifications (CES). Usage of MOLEX DuraClik 5023520400 connectors or similar sizes is recommended. Suppliers can suggest standard OEM connectors. Component Data Sheets (CDS) must be completed, and approval must be obtained from the VF E/E Department.

Fixing.
Ambient light assembly must be affixed to the door and instrument panel using screws.

Connector – Electrical Connection.
The Body Control Module (BCM) connects to the LED Module via LIN. Brightness adjustments are selected by the user via the Multimedia Head Unit (MHU). The MHU codes the information and sends CAN messages to BCM. BCM receives the CAN messages, packages the information into LIN format, and communicates with the LED Module. 

The LED Modules can be wired individually (LINin, LINout). They can also be controlled individually and simultaneously. PCBA can be flashed when parameters need to change. Below is the system schematic for ambient light functionality.

7 Supplier Responsibilities. 

Supplier is responsible to provide or ensure work completion. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to mitigate the risk of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

### Customer Service Requirements:
- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
  The spare parts provided by the supplier should be available at the start of the whole vehicle production. 

- **Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
  The support period for after-sales spare parts must ensure the life cycle of the project and meet requirements specified in GTC after the end of production of the VinFast vehicle, unless otherwise noted in the SOR.  

- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
  The supplier of the first-level assembly must provide VinFast’s after-sales engineering department with design, usage, and maintenance information before OTS. This includes BOM tables, part structures and function descriptions, fault diagnostics, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).

10 Appearance Approval Process.

The Appearance Approval Report (AAR) is applicable for suppliers providing components affecting CMF appearance. This process requires VinFast Approval prior to PPAP deliverables. The report confirms that VinFast Design Quality has inspected the final product and ensured it meets all required appearance specifications.  

Harmony review is significantly important for assessing the quality or homogeneity of components relative to adjacent parts.  

Design Quality requires all suppliers to submit non-commercial value sample parts, including complete assembly parts (P-level) and child components (D-level). The quantity and specifications of the submitted parts are detailed in **VFDST00038401**.
