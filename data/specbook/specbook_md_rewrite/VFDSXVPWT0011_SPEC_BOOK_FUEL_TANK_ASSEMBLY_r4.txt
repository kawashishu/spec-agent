**5.1.1 Component/System description**  
The Fuel Tank is one of the main parts of the Fuel System. When functioning in conjunction with the complete fuel system, it should be considered a high-level safety module, meeting all legislative and ‘due-care’ requirements before release for vehicle production.

The Fuel Tank Supplier is responsible for integrating sub-system components into their design and completing fuel system testing activities and validation. The design and development of the complete fuel system must consider the physical and performance characteristics of the sub-system.

### FUEL_TANK_ASSEMBLY

#### Components Description
The fuel tank assembly includes various sub-system components, such as the Fuel Pump Module, Carbon Canister Module, and Fuel Lines Assembly, which together achieve the overall physical and performance target of the fuel tank.

Since the fuel system comprises many sub-system components, including the Fuel Pump Module, Fuel Filter, and Carbon Canister, their design and usage affect overall performance. The performance will be judged both on bench testing activities and full vehicle conditions.

If any technical issues arise during the design and development stage of the complete fuel system, VinFast will make the final decision for design and development directions. If a supplier or partnering Component/Module Supplier decides to resolve issues without involving VinFast, they will assume full responsibility for all potential costs incurred.

The definition of “tank complete” varies by project agreement but generally includes the tank body, fuel pump, and all necessary welded or in-molded components, such as blow plugs, weld studs, inner venting pipes, and other intakes. Evaporation pipes and rollover valves are included if welded or fastened to the tank or placed in the tank perimeter by other means.

#### Fuel Tank Definition
The term "fuel tank" in this document refers to the fuel tank body, which includes:
- **Fuel tank components**: venting valves, liquid trap, baffles, etc.
  - Fuel level ventilation valve (FLVV)
  - Roll over valves (ROV)
  - Spit-back valve
  - Inlet check valve (ICV)
  - Fuel inlet
  - Anti-discharge nipple
  - Grade Vent Valve(s) [GVVs]
  - Fill Limit Valve (FLV)
- **Fuel Delivery Module (FDM)**:
  - Pump Electronic Module (PEM)
  - Level sender
  - Filter
  - Pump
  - Permanent magnet motor
  - Safety valve
  - One-way valve
  - Shell
  - Other related components.
- **Additional items**:
  - Sealing between the tank and the FDM.
  - Fasteners for heat shields and crash protections (if necessary).
  - Tank straps (if applicable).
  - Attachments for fuel lines, such as hoses, EVAP lines to the canister, and internal vent lines.

#### Development Considerations
The design of the fuel tank must prioritize:
1. **Zero Maintenance**: Ensuring minimal maintenance requirements.
2. **Minimum Fasteners Quantities**: Limiting the number of fasteners.
3. **Ease of Assembly and Disassembly**: Simplifying assembly and disassembly processes.
4. **Weight and Cost Targets**: Aligning the design with weight and cost objectives.
Page 8
4. Quality Control shall be performed and documented throughout the complete design and development process.

### 5.1.2 Function
The primary functions of the fuel system are to store and distribute fuel to the engine safely and reliably. Additionally, the fuel system acts as a functional subsystem designed to manage the vehicle’s emissions, noise, and performance characteristics. 

The expected lifetime of the fuel system is 15 years or 300,000 km, whichever is longer. 

The tank should be designed for installation in the vehicle to ensure accommodation of level measurement, filling, and safety devices. It must be positioned and designed to allow replacement and repair as a single component. 

To ensure seamless fuel system integration into the designated vehicle platforms, suppliers must outline clear design criteria to prevent misinterpretation during development and production phases. Any queries or changes outside the listed criteria must be communicated and agreed upon before implementing engineering changes.

The functional contents of the complete fuel system must be considered as reusable, either as carry-over systems (units reused from existing vehicles) or ones under development for similar applications. This principle applies to system specifications. Geometrical components may require unique geometry due to packaging constraints and boundary conditions.

### 5.1.3 Storage Module
#### A. Vapor Space:
- Tank Usable Volume: 65 L  
- Assuming Unusable Volume: 0.5 L  
- Assuming Component Displacement Volume: 0.5 L  
- **Target Volume:** 65 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 66 L  
- Tank Core Volume without 5.5mm Wall Thickness: 82 L  
- **Vapor Space:** (82 - 65 - 0.5 - 0.5) / (82 - 0.5) = 19.6%

### D. Height-Volume Curve  

The height-volume curve provides a theoretical representation of the relationship between the height and volume of the fuel tank. It helps in assessing the tank's structural and spatial requirements as volume increases.  

---

### 5.1.4 Variants  

The program team has initially defined three fuel tank variants to support this program:  
- Fuel tank for ASEAN (Euro 5).  
- Fuel tank for EU (Euro 6).  
- Fuel tank for US (LEV III).  

The extent of commonality in solutions to meet different market requirements shall be decided to maximize efficiency, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. The fuel tank supplier must confirm the most cost-performance effective solution.  

---

### 5.1.5 Interfaces  

The components must be designed in a way that functionality is guaranteed in combination with all the adjoining systems and interfaces.  

**Overview of major interface points:**  
- **Fuel Lines and Canister**: Compatibility and secure connections.  
- **BIW (Body in White)**: Clearances, packaging, resonances, and stiffness considerations.  
- **Floor**: Structural alignment and integration with vehicle design.  
- **Chassis**: Clearances to chassis components, including elements like the fuel system, braking system, piping, and rear axle system.  
- **Complete Vehicle Performance Targets**: Ensuring the fuel tank contributes to meeting overall vehicle performance goals.  
- **Electrical Connection**: Maintaining wiring and connections efficiently for fuel system electronics.

Page 12
5.1.6 VF36 Package Layout Overview.

It is the responsibility of VinFast and the supplier to achieve a durable package of the fuel tank within this program, ensuring the fuel tank design and the body package interface with all nearby components and the vulnerable Ground Clearance Line complies with all applicable requirements. 

**Fuel Tank Geometrical Limitations and Boundaries**  
- The pinch line shall not be the closest part of the blow mold to any part sensitive to chafing, e.g., brake pipes and tank straps.  
- The tank may be placed on the vulnerable ground clearance as specified. The straps will be positioned below the vulnerable ground clearance but above the principle ground clearance (including tolerances).  
- The contact between the car body and the tank shall occur on controlled and geometrically secured areas covered with pads to avoid wear on the car body and paint.  
- System and packaging engineers at VinFast must approve installation theoretically initially and later by complete car tests.  

**Clearance to Surrounding Components**:  
- To the floor of the vehicle above the tank, there shall be a minimum of 5 mm clearance, except for standoff surfaces, which must be agreed upon between the responsible Fuel System and Body engineers. Typical stiffness requirements include 3kN/mm.  
- To surrounding components on the sides and bottom, there shall be a minimum clearance of 10 mm.  
- To brake lines, minimum clearance of 15 mm is required.  
- To passing surrounding components during auto decking, a clearance of at least 10 mm is needed to prevent the tank from becoming stuck during installation.  
- Between the fuel tank and prop shaft envelope, there must be a minimum clearance of 19 mm.  
- From the fuel tank to the exhaust system, there must be at least 50 mm clearance if there is a heat shield; without the shield, 100 mm is required.
- Between the tank and heat shield, there shall be a clearance of at least 10 mm.  
- Between the heat shield and fuel lines, there shall be a clearance of at least 35 mm.  
- The clearance between the level gauge floated arm and the inside of the tank and other components shall be at least 20 mm.  
- Clearance between the body and fuel line (including quick connector) shall be at least 15 mm.  
- Clearance between any part of the fuel system and any part of the electrical system shall be a minimum of 100 mm.
Page 13
The release function of the quick connector must face away from surrounding components, e.g., the body, to prevent opening of the QC when installed under the vehicle.

### 5.1.6 Fuel Storage
The fuel tank should support an effective/usable volume of approximately 65 liters. Vented expansion volume shall be 4±1% of the nominal liquid volume. Nominal liquid volume is defined as the non-useful volume plus the drivable volume. Expansion volume is to be tested according to ENVFILL (Japanese filling test excluded). Non-useful volume shall be a maximum of 0.5 liters. The supplier shall test according to SAE J398.

### 5.1.7 Fuel Flow
The function of the fuel pump is to draw fuel out of the tank and deliver it to the inlet of the engine HP pump. Time to bring a volume of 0.4L initially at atmospheric pressure to 5.1 bars does not take into consideration the pressure of the fuel line.

### 5.1.8 Fuel Filter Filtration Performance
Filtration performance is in accordance with DIN ISO 13438 and must address the requirements of contamination at the low-pressure system:
- Admissible contaminants: < 1.18 mg

#### Particle Retention Efficiency
| Larger than X (microns) | Particle Retention Efficiency |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 5 µm                    | >40%                          |
| 10 µm                   | >85%                          |
| 15 µm                   | >95%                          |

#### Internal Fuel Filter (Integrated in Fuel Pump Module)
- The filter must last until the end of vehicle life, or 200,000 km or 15 years.
- Minimum dust capacity: 8 g.

#### External Fuel Filter
- Replacement of the fuel filter is expected every 20,000 km until the end of vehicle life.
- Minimum dust capacity: 3 g.

### 5.1.9 Durability
Safety-related components and systems shall not fail throughout the vehicle’s life. This must be demonstrated either at the component or subsystem level tests, against testing representing a severity level corresponding to 300,000 km. This test applies to extreme customers, often referred to as the 99th percentile customers.

### 5.1.10 Thermal Influences
The fuel system is subjected to heat from the exhaust system, ambient conditions, road surfaces, and other factors that may affect function, properties, and service life. Materials, shielding, and design decisions must undergo careful review and endurance testing.

#### Thermal Aging of Polymers
Safety-related systems or components must provide 20 years or 300,000 km of service, whichever occurs first. Aging temperature for each system or part is calculated with respect to the worst-case drive pattern, ambient conditions, and markets.

#### Tank Temperature Durability
The fuel tank design will account for thermal endurance.

### FUEL_TANK_ASSEMBLY  

#### 5.1.10 Thermal Influences  
- **< 80°C:** All requirements in this document apply.  
- **80-100°C:** The requirement is that the tank shall survive for maximum 8 minutes.  
- **100-120°C:** The requirement is that the tank shall survive for maximum a couple of seconds.  

#### 5.1.11 Liquid Carry Over to Canister  
If liquid fuel enters the evap system, performances such as "Control of fuel evaporative emissions," "Canister purge control," "Leakage detection," and "Fuel refueling" can be seriously impaired. Liquid fuel must remain inside the vent port of the fuel tank during all driving conditions, and under no circumstances contaminate the canister carbon bed.  

Typical acceleration and time figures for the fuel tank that can be used are:  
- **Braking:** 9 m/s² during 6 s.  
- **Acceleration:** 5.5 m/s² during 4 s.  
- **Acceleration:** 7 m/s² during 2 s.  
- **Lateral acceleration:** 8 m/s² during 30 s.  
- **Extreme values (any direction):** 10 m/s² during 30 s.  

#### 5.1.12 Aerodynamics  
The fuel system can contribute to overall airflow under the body of the vehicle. The bottom of the tank shall be designed as flat as possible, any air pockets on the side of the tank shall be filled, and the design shall not have unnecessarily large corners. The front edge shall use soft contours if possible, and the rear edge shall use sharp contours if possible.  

#### 5.1.13 Water Submersion  
All functions of the fuel system shall be maintained during a drive through a 500 mm deep and 10 meters long pool of water, corresponding to 350 mm water height from the bottom of the tank.  

#### 5.1.14 ESD/EMC  
All metal parts must be grounded. The reason for this is ESD protection. The design of the system shall be approved before release. The fuel system, or any of its components, shall not, under any circumstances, show any tendency of charging with static electricity to a level at which a discharge may occur. Parts should be designed and tested according to SAE J1645. Lines containing a flow of liquid fuel or high concentrations of vapor shall be safely separated from electrical cables and harnesses.  

#### 5.1.15 Fuel Vapor Ventilation  
The fuel system must be designed with correct ventilation to keep the pressure level between -20 mbar and +80 mbar under all conditions. Any emission of fuel vapor out of the fuel tank must be absorbed 100% via the Carbon Canister Module.  

The ventilation system for the fuel system has to avoid fire risks. Connections, lines, pipes, and valves of the ventilation system must not be positioned in areas with high thermal radiation, e.g. exhaust system. If necessary, the ventilation system parts shall be protected with corresponding heat shields.  

#### 5.1.16 Fuel Vapor Management  
The complete Fuel System must be able to:  
- Manage vapor by limiting its generation, escape, and transportation for later purge and combustion by the vehicle engine.  
- Limit vapor generation to ensure no vapor loss while running thermal expansion with RVP 12 PSI (83 kPa) from 20°C to 50°C within 3 hours, when the vehicle is parked with a fuel tank inclination of 18° sway in any direction.
Page 15
5.1.16 Fuel Vapour Management  
The complete Fuel System must be able:  
- To ensure no vapour loss due to driving the vehicle over mountain roads with RVP 12PSI (83kPa).  
- To provide minimum odour nuisance while the vehicle is being driven and/or parked after extreme driving conditions, such as high-speed driving at multiple bends, uphill, and downhill. These conditions can be found in environments like Proving Ground or mountain roads.  
- During the bleeding process from the complete system while driving and/or the vehicle is parked, minimum vapour odour nuisance is expected outside the passenger compartment.  

5.1.17 Fuel Quantity Sensing and Signal Accuracy  
The Fuel Tank Assembly in conjunction with the Fuel Pump Module (FPM) must detect fuel level and provide a signal proportional to the stored fuel quantity during the complete vehicle lifetime.  

Precision demands for the fuel quantity signal:  
- ±1.5 liters between 0% and 20% of full capacity.  
- ±3.0 liters between 20% and 80% of full capacity.  
- ±1.5 liters between 80% and 100% of full capacity.  

The vehicle condition shall be stationary and level within ±0.5°. The FPM’s Floater height must cover all possible fuel heights, starting from 3.5 liters to possible refueling volumes at 3rd Nozzle Shut Offs plus 1 liter, adjusting as the possible fuel volume changes.  

5.1.18 ORVR On Board Refueling Vapor Recovery  
Emission of hydrocarbons during tank refilling shall be less than 0.1 g/gallon. The fuel tank supplier must enable optimized recirculation (pressure drops, dimensions, etc.) and meet CARB/EPA integrated system standards by limiting canister loading to less than 5.0 g HC/gallon. Backpressure in the tank venting system shall be minimized during filling to avoid premature shutoff while maintaining unrestricted air/vapor flow.  

5.1.19 Leakage Detection / On Board Diagnosis (USA Market)  
The onboard diagnostic system must ensure tightness of the complete fuel system and detect holes with a diameter of 0.5 mm or larger. The system stability must manage specific pressure curves without deformation or creeping, while avoiding disturbing noises during diagnostics. Liquid locks shall not isolate any part of the fuel system.  

Detection parameters:  
- Leakages of diameter 0.5 mm detectable at 15%-85% filling volumes with inclinations up to 17° in all directions.  
- Large leakages like missing filler caps detectable up to 104% filling volumes with inclinations up to 17°.  

Requirement: Maximum pressure drop between the leakage diagnosis pump (LDP), fuel tank, and fuel filler cap shall not exceed 2.5 kPa at inclinations of up to 17° forward/rear and 10° side-to-side.

**6.25 NVH Requirements**  
The system must not cause any kind of disturbing sound (relative movement, wind noise, squeak, and rattle, temperature, flexural torsion, etc.) during any operation.

The system must not have any annoying noise at vehicle- and audio-system excitation under all environmental conditions and over the fixed component service life. This has to be guaranteed over the whole operating and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity). The free-of-noise requirement and other specific specifications have to be aligned with the responsible testing team.

6.25.1 NVH: Interior noise from fuel pump.

The interior noise level from the fuel pump shall be measured in all seating positions. The interior noise from the fuel pump shall be measured at two conditions:
1. The fuel pump shall be operated at correct voltage, if needed by an external power source of 13.5 V at battery position. All other systems shall be turned off.
2. The interior climate fan shall run at 20% of max speed. All other systems, including the engine, shall be turned off.

When measuring only the fuel pump (case 1), the interior 1/3-octave band noise levels must not exceed NRA 20H. The requirements are valid for both front and rear seats.

When measuring with the climate fan on (case 2), pure tones caused by the fuel pump shall not be too audible. This is defined as follows: Pure tones (defined in the narrow-band analysis) must be at least 6 dB lower than the corresponding 1/3-octave band.

---

6.25.2 NVH: Interior noise from fuel slosh.

Purpose: The purpose of the requirement is to ensure that the assembly will not be designed to avoid any disturbing noises inside or outside the passenger compartment of the vehicle.

Test procedure: The interior noise from fuel slosh shall be evaluated in all seating positions in a complete vehicle, and the vehicle deceleration versus time should also be measured and noted. The noise from fuel slosh shall be approved by VinFast subjective ranking, which is the ultimate judgment for fuel slosh noise acceptance.

Running conditions:
- The test is to be performed outside the vehicle, in optimal weather conditions (i.e. no wind, no rain or other disturbing noise pollution).
- Start with rolling the car down a downhill slope, as well as on flat ground, at 6-7 km/h with the engine and all other systems turned off and gently apply the brake to measure, and record, the fuel slosh noise.

Two typical braking scenarios are most relevant:
1. One gentle braking with a peak deceleration of approximately 0.2g.
2. One slightly tougher braking with a peak deceleration of approximately 0.4g.

**FUEL_TANK_ASSEMBLY**  

**Measurement cases:**  
The interior noise level from fuel slosh shall be measured in all seating positions and for all fuel levels (12 repetitions per fuel level and running condition).

**Analysis:**  
A typical Noise Level versus time for fuel slosh interior noise is displayed, where the first slosh noise event can be distinguished from the following ones. The start point for the investigations is the change of sign in the acceleration profile (x-direction → yellow “time-box”).

a) The measurement part corresponding to the first slosh event is extracted for itself, as well as the measurement part corresponding to the following sloshes.  
b) The 1/3-octave band peak hold noise spectrum for each measurement and each measurement position is calculated and averaged over the 12 repetitions.  
c) The resulting 1/3-octave band peak hold noise spectra are plotted against target levels, as well as the 1/3-octave band noise spectrum of the background noise.

**Requirement:**  
The requirement is subjective evaluation ranking >7.

6.25.3 NVH: Fuel tank isolator pads.  
The static stiffness of the fuel tank isolator pads shall be measured. The fuel tank isolator pads shall have stiffness less than 30 N/mm each.  

6.25.4 NVH: Fuel tank straps.  
The fuel tank straps shall be rubber isolated to the car body for the hybrid vehicles. Between the metal tank strap and the metal car body, the bushing shall be designed to have a minimum distance of >7 mm to allow for adequate isolation. The design of the bushing will be optimized by CAE and testing.  

6.26 Weight Management.  
Because the vehicle weight has a significant influence on the energy consumption of the vehicle, the major goal of weight management is to minimize the complete vehicle weight.  

Throughout the development process, attention must be paid to a weight-optimized design for all components. All weight reduction potentials must be demonstrated by the supplier, along with their impact on cost, timing, quality, etc.  

The fuel tank shall be designed to minimize weight without compromising functionality, service life, or other requirements. The supplier must specify the system's mass on the system drawing. The supplier shall also provide a weight/cost plan to reduce weight during the product's lifetime.  

The Fuel Tank Assembly must not exceed a weight target of 14 kg.  

6.27 Environmental Compatibility.  
Please refer to the VINFAST Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VINFAST Trading and Production LLC (“VINFAST”).  

**Additional Requirements:**  
The minimization of environmental impacts throughout the full lifecycle of a product is a critical factor for developing innovative solutions.  

A product's minimization of environmental impacts requires:  
- Use of recyclable materials.  
- Use of recycled materials and renewable resources.  
- Prevention of hazardous substances.  
- Minimization of compartment emissions, including odor.  
- Minimization of consumption of resources.  
- Strategy for waste prevention.  
- Parts marking for identification at the end of life.  

6.27.1 The requirements of the following standards must be fulfilled.

Page 41
Enable sequential deployment of all components to avoid noise and pressure peaks and ensure deployment checks for each component. After deployment, pyrotechnical components must not leave solid combustion residues classified as toxic waste or hazardous substances per waste legislation. Non-compliant components must be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances. Deployment should be immediately visible acoustically or via feedback at the deployment tool or vehicle directly. Positions of pyrotechnical components (including hidden ones like battery safety terminal clamps and active safety headrests) must be marked. In cases of non-deployment, removal of pyrotechnical components must avoid pre-dismantling if technically possible to ensure fastener accessibility.

### 6.27.4 Recycling:
#### Recycled Materials
Material selection must focus on reducing variety and ensuring compatibility with proven recycling technologies. Preference should be given to secondary raw materials such as post-consumer and post-production recyclates (e.g., recycled PET fibers, textiles, foams, thermoplastics).

#### Recycling Scheme
Design for recycling is required for parts and components to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life. Suppliers must provide a recycling scheme including the recycling process layout, preferred recycling partners, and cost estimates to VinFast's environmental experts team before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### 7 Testing and Validation and DVP&R
The supplier is responsible for the Design Validation Plan (DVP) for components/sub-systems. All DVP activities must be completed prior to the complete vehicle DVP.

**Reference DVP:** VFDSXVPWT0111: CSUV_DVP_FUEL_TANK

A detailed technical report must be delivered by the supplier to VinFast, containing the results of all tests specified within this document. It must include actual measured values for each test, as OK or NOK statements alone are insufficient. All tests must be conducted by the supplier unless agreed otherwise with VinFast in writing. Test tanks must meet all defined requirements in the drawings and related product documents.
Page 42
Includes, but is not limited to, material thickness, materials and blend thereof, and installation of sub-components.

The fuel tank shall not cause any smell of fuel inside the car compartment. The surface of the fuel tank shall be free from unintended pores and blisters. If nothing else is stated, testing is to be done with dry tanks.

If not stated differently in specific tests, the temperature shall be room temperature (RT), i.e., 23±3ºC. The exact temperature is to be recorded. General tolerance for temperature is ±3ºC if nothing else is stated.

The humidity is to be recorded.

Any deviation or differences from the above-mentioned temperature requirements are to be agreed upon with VinFast, and the daily ambient average temperature shall be stated in the technical report.

General pulling speed in testing is 100 mm/min if not otherwise stated.

Differences from production process conditions when producing the tanks and the parts that are used in the tests are to be reported for each test. All tests in this document shall be conducted with samples produced using production-intended tools and machines unless written agreement has been made with VinFast.

### 7. Test Plan
The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. 

The controlling of the test results must be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding validation engineer and the component lead engineer of VinFast.

The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly during the testing phase, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the SDS component is with SDS. Testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule.

SDS must ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers. Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VinFast/SDS.

If testing was done with incorrect parts, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the cost of SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests have to be re-planned, and retesting has to be paid by SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

### Data Required in the DVP&R:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, and legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of testing setup with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
