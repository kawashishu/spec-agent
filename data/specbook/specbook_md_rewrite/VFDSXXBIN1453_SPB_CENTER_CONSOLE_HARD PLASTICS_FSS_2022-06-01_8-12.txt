**NVH and Driving Comfort.**

General: Complete Vehicle NVH and driving comfort targets.  
The vehicle shall enable an acoustics and vibration comfort which is well balanced with vehicle dynamics and drivability so that long distance driving comfort as well as driving over rough road is neither exhausting nor annoying. This requires the absolute absence of squeak & rattle issues under all load cases (speed, maneuver, temperature, etc.).

**Supplier Responsibility.**  
The validation of NVH and driving comfort will be done on complete vehicle level and comprises real customer operation conditions. Before the validation on complete vehicle level takes place, the supplier has to assure readiness of the components respectively the system for durability and general testing. The evidence for the test maturity of the components has to be reported in the DVP&R (Design, Verification and Development Report) at component level.

System suppliers are requested to perform validation activities as specified in respective technical specifications. All parts that are required for the validation activities are specified by DVP&R and shall meet the required maturity level. VINFAST will define quality criteria and validation methods for alignment with suppliers. In general, it is mandatory for the supplier to support the NVH development process and the complete product cycle as well. The support comprises intensive and active cooperation with the development team and manufacturing regarding root cause investigations. 

The supplier has to consider and support the achievement of complete vehicle NVH targets (objective and subjective targets) at component and system level. All components have to be free of squeak and rattle noises to avoid psychoacoustic annoyance during all operation conditions of the vehicle including audio acoustic excitation. 

The robustness of design has to be assured and reported virtually and in the hardware phase before serial release. The sound of actuation noises must not be audible, respectively representing a high-quality impression integrated into the complete vehicle. The requirements are to be performed in all specified environmental and thermic conditions. During serial manufacturing, a capable quality assurance process has to be established to ensure the quality level.

The supplier has to provide components for testing and NVH tuning and ensures the participation of specialists during local testing and troubleshooting processes.

#### Generally:
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, and road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, and road (deicing) salts.
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

---

#### Corrosion Tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

**Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:**
- **Fog Test:** ISO6270 CH (acceptance criteria listed below).
- **Salt Spray Test:** ISO9227 (acceptance criteria listed below).

**Organic Coatings:**
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT):** ISO11997 Cycle B (acceptance criteria listed below).
- Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

---

### Test Criteria:

| **Area**                   | **Corrosivity**        | **Metallic Coatings**     | **Organic Coatings**         | **Pass Criteria** |
|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                  | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227       | 96 h → ISO6270 CH            | No red rust       |
| Exterior                   | Medium               | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227       | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust, CCT: See below |
| High & not visible for customer / High & visible | High                     | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227     | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust, CCT: See below |

---

#### Pass Criteria for Organic Coatings after CCT:
1. **Rust creep (ISO4628-8):**
   - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
   - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.
2. **Blistering:** Blister size max. S2 (DIN EN ISO 4628-2).
3. **Edge corrosion:** ≤ 10%.
4. **Weld seam corrosion:** ≤ 5%.
5. **Degree of rusting:** ≤ Ri 1 (ISO4628-3).

---

#### Additional Points:
- **Interior Corrosivity:** Generally considered a dry area, meaning an area with low corrosivity. Exceptions include the floor area or areas where wetness/abrasion (e.g., from shoes or spilled liquids) might produce corrosion.
- **Galvanic Corrosion:** When combining different metals, avoid galvanic corrosion by applying suitable coating to such parts.
- **Painted Edges:** Edges, especially painted edges, must be burr-free to ensure proper edge coverage and prevent wear.
- **Seat Structure:** Uncoated (blank steel) parts must be corrosion-free. Areas prone to corrosion risk must not be visible to the customer and must ensure full functionality over the vehicle’s lifetime.
- **Vehicle Tooling:** Usually stored in the trunk and considered to have low corrosivity exposure. Tool surfaces with wear may have medium corrosivity.

# Test Plan.

The test plan regulates by whom and when the testing will be done and which testing devices are necessary. This plan also shows the results in good visual state and the progress of testing. The controlling of the test results has to be ensured at all times. If VinFast wants verification of test results on their own, the SDS has to deliver the needed parts free of charge.

The test procedures and the documentation have to be approved by the corresponding test engineer of VinFast. The test plan must be supplemented and updated weekly, or if new data/information due to development changes is needed.

The responsibility for the complete safeguarding of the component belongs to the SDS. The testing has to be planned in due time to ensure approval and/or re-testing in case of negative results on the committed schedule. The SDS has to ensure that VinFast gets all relevant test protocols/reports for verification and that VinFast can attend any testing at the SDS site or their testing centers.

Deviations from approved testing procedures have to be agreed upon between VinFast and the SDS. If testing is conducted with incorrect, missing parts, or different testing procedures, the testing has to be redone at the expense of the SDS. In case of negative test results, the tests must be re-planned and retested by the SDS if they are responsible for the failure.

### The following data must be included in the DVP&R:
- Testing with a declaration of standard, norm, or legal requirement.
- How and with which devices the testing was performed (description of the testing setup with pictures).
- Responsible test department.
- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in the form of a project plan).
- Part variant, description of the part.
- Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by the VinFast testing department. The initial data filling must be completed by the SDS and submitted to VinFast (at least four weeks after the nomination of the SDS).

The SDS must plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage. 

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VinFast. The test plan must be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed upon by the test department, SQA (VinFast), and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS must deliver proposals to meet the committed schedule.

Upon request, the SDS develops a test plan for each component.
Page 40
The information, such as beginning and end of testing, for the test plan required from the SDS is marked as “red” in the attached example test plan.

**Test Plan Example**

**Testing**  
**General**  
The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.17).

It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.

In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS have to be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered from VinFast by the SDS.

Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for only his component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VFDST-requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VinFast.

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved.

All tests must be documented according to VF standard, alternatively to SDS standard, if this is accepted by VinFast.

The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification.

The tests have to be brought in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.

Samples for sample inspections must be made available in time or no later than the agreed date (in coordination with the test department).
Page 41
Even manual samples can provide sufficient information in certain cases. Measures can thus be introduced in time in the event of assembly problems in order to ensure the installability of the test parts.

VinFast "Logistics" determines the number of sample parts, and VinFast "Purchase" orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery.

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS. CAD data models in compliance with VinFast requirements must be provided in time for virtual sample manufacturing.

**Marking of sample parts**  
Marking of sample parts must follow VF Standard VFDST00008700 [41]. Preparation of measurement reports follows VF Standard VFDST00008900 [43], and reference points systems follow VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28].

---

**Release by test-departments**  
The responsible VinFast test department will release components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the SDS and during the complete vehicle integration tests. The SDS must submit positive test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any issues (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the SDS must submit a test report, remain present upon request, and provide proposals for solutions to keep all milestones and targets on track.

The first sheet of the report must state an OK or NOK result.

---

**Analyses, test-reports**  
The SDS must provide measurement reports (VF Standard VFDST00008900 [43]) in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during the prototype generations. After the individual tests, the test samples must be analyzed in detail. The measurement and test results must be proven by means of individual values and documented in a test report, which must be provided to the responsible VinFast department for release.

Upon request, the results and documentation of tests carried out (initial sample inspections and inspections carried out parallel to development) must be submitted to the specialist department responsible for release. Tests carried out parallel to series production must be planned and documented at regular intervals or as required.
Page 42
### Test-report/-information:
- Description/picture of the part with proper documentation (including part number, change index, materials, production process, additives such as grease, and any deviations from the approved serial process).
- All parts must be labeled with a description.
- The reason for testing must be indicated, e.g., negative test results, with the attachment of earlier test reports.
- Testing must include the precise naming of the testing standard, norm, legal requirement, or an exact description of the agreed testing procedure.

- Recommendations.
- A description of corrective measures or further approaches in cases of negative test results.
- Progress of testing status.
- Listing of all tests in a table, indicating the responsible person, part status, and a comparison of target date and due date. If negative test results occur, the SDS is required to provide a new date for re-testing, along with countermeasures, for VinFast's approval. This must include the responsible person and company responsible for conducting the test.

### Progress of Testing Status:
- All tests must be listed in a table, identifying the responsible person, part status, and a comparison of target dates and due dates. Negative test results require the supplier to propose a re-test date and countermeasures for VinFast’s approval, including accountability details (responsible person and company).
- The VinFast test engineer must periodically be updated on actual status and progress.
- If VinFast orders parts for testing directly, the parts’ detailed description must be attached.

### Archival Storage of Tested Parts:
- Tested parts may only be scrapped with permission from the VinFast test department.
- Upon request by the test engineer, all testing documentation (including reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.

### BIW-supports, Testing Devices, and Equipment:
- The number and configuration of testing devices and equipment must be aligned with the VinFast test department.
- BIW supports (from VinFast) are provided for the testing period.
- Testing structures (such as vibration testing devices, devices for environmental testing, and long-term run structures) must also be coordinated with the VinFast test department.

Requirements relating to the mechanical properties of the components, particularly such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, must be assured via FEM calculations.

The tooling dimension for injection molding must be optimized via corresponding simulations. Upon request, operative calculation models that represent the respective development status must be made available to VinFast technical departments for internal calculations and integration work.

The supplier must provide suitable FEM models to VinFast without extra costs. Tests from the supplier according to the evaluation plan must be calculatively documented (e.g., FEM) before tool dimensioning. FEM models must comply with VinFast standards without extra costs.

Page 53
• Basically no distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range is allowed. In particular, by the use of materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficient, the behavior has to be kept.
• The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded.
• These shown component tests are basic required tests. The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VinFast and the SDS, and will be binding.
• If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.
• Parts needed for testing activities at VinFast test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge.

### Geometrical Integration

**General**  
See General Engineering Requirements for Suppliers.

**RPS (reference position system):**  
The classification of the testing range happens in a functional area. The target of the determination concept is a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly determination of the assembly and component parts. A RPS-concept for the design has to be done with the quality assurance in the SE-process. The RPS-determination concept is the basis for the function of components and assembly. The part positioning to adjoining parts has to happen among the RPS-system and VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28], according to interior- and BIW-department.

### Tolerance analyses:

The following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems, including BIW and attachment points:
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms
- Thermal expansion has to be considered

### Interfaces

The components must be designed such that the function is guaranteed in combination with the adjoining systems.  
The interfaces must be worked out in cooperation with VinFast in consideration of a quality method (e.g. FMEA, risk filter).
