- Signal Routing.
- Application Signal Processing.
- Network Management.
- Automatic static headlight leveling.
- Acquisition of status of the washer fluid level switch.

5.3.2 Detailed Functions Description.

5.3.2.1 Message Routing.
The XGW shall route messages between the different bus interfaces (CAN, LIN, FLEXRAY) according to the routing table in [1].
The processing time of the XGW shall not exceed 5ms + the cycle time of the message.

5.3.2.2 Signal Routing.
The XGW shall route signals between the different bus interfaces (CAN, LIN, FLEXRAY) according to the routing table in [1].
The processing time of the XGW shall not exceed 5ms + the cycle time of the message.

If a source ECU discontinues transmitting a signal on the network, the XGW shall use the SNA value of that signal to transmit to the target system. The SNA value of a signal is specified in the routing table [1].

If no SNA value is defined, it will be set to the default value. This means:
1) During the Gateway ECU initialization, it shall send the default value to the target network.
2) If no signal is available on the source network, just before timeout is detected, it shall send the last received value to the target network.
3) After timeout detection, it shall send the SNA value to the target network if an SNA value is defined. Otherwise, it shall send the default value after timeout detection.

5.3.2.3 Application Signal Processing.
The XGW shall perform signal conversion between the different bus interfaces if required from the routing table [1].
