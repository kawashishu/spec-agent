3.8 Product Safety.

The seating system design is developed following the considerations of IATF 16949 section 4.4.1.2 regarding Product Safety and the related steps using dFMEA, with suitable checks and validation as preventative actions to mitigate each potential failure mode. The process was initiated in steps starting with P-diagram and interface matrix to generate a function tree as the index basis for the dFMEA itself:

Interface matrix:
- Numbers in each corner represent interaction types:
  - +2: interaction is necessary for function
  - +1: interaction is beneficial but not absolutely necessary for function
  - 0: interaction does not affect functionality
  - -1: interaction causes negative effects but does not prevent function
  - -2: interaction must be prevented to achieve functionality.

Function tree:
- Protect occupant in passive conditions.
- Protect occupant in crash events.
- Provide comfort and sturdy seating.
- Allow functional adjustability and features.
- Enable easy manufacture and assembly.
- Meet vehicle integration targets.
- Allow serviceability.
- Meet product attribute targets.

The seating system design is developed following the considerations of IATF 16949 section 4.4.1.2 regarding Product Safety and the related steps using dFMEA, with suitable checks and validation as preventative actions to mitigate each potential failure mode.  

The process was initiated in steps starting with the P-diagram and interface matrix to generate a function tree as the index basis for the dFMEA itself.

Included in the dFMEA are the following considerations to mitigate potential product safety concerns:
1. Cross-check of all historical product recall campaign failure causes (NHTSA and Rapex) from the past 10 years, to ensure inclusion in the FMEA’s potential failures and causes.
2. Function group 9 lists every regulatory requirement’s failure-to-comply mode as a line item in the FMEA.
3. Failure causes which extend into component sub-supplier’s scope have been cascaded through Special Characteristic Agreement (SCA) documents for tracking and auditing through their respective organization per IATF 16949 Product Safety standards, as committed within VinFast’s Statement of Requirements at nomination and Purchasing Terms & Conditions agreements.

4 FEATURES, PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERISTICS.

4.1 Sub-systems and Functional Attributes.

4.1.1 Frame Structure.
The second row seat structure consists of two main elements: the cushion chassis and the seat backframe.

The two elements are joined via 4X M12 bolts. As an added safety measure, to mitigate risks of bolts loosening during service life, the bolts include a threadlock patch.

The backframe consists of two sidemembers, two crossmembers, a pair of recliners (power) and a recliner driveshaft.

Materials used for the pressed parts are as follows:
- **Sidemembers (x2):** Material grade CR330Y590T-DP (VDA 239-100), Thickness 1.6mm, Manufacturing source - Vinfast in-house, Vietnam.
- **Upper crossmember:** Material grade HC420LA (EN 10268), Thickness 1.0mm, Manufacturing source - Vinfast in-house, Vietnam.
- **Lower crossmember:** Material grade HC420LA (EN 10268), Thickness 1.0mm, Manufacturing source - Vinfast in-house, Vietnam.
- **Recliners & driveshaft:** Composite material, refer to sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3, Manufacturing source - Imasen, Japan (via HCMF).

The backframe assembly is welded together onsite at Vinfast, Vietnam. The Vinfast assembly drawing provides full details of weld interfaces.

Process control during production is required to ensure:
1. The recliners welded onto either side of the frame are positionally synchronized.
2. The recliners’ fully-locked condition (manual versions) is synchronized before the recliner driveshaft is attached.

4 FEATURES, PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERISTICS

4.1 Sub-systems and Functional Attributes

4.1.3 Fore/ aft adjustment (track slide).

The power track slides, consisting of one inboard assembly and one outboard assembly, include upper and lower slide rails. The lower rails attach to a lower carrier, which provides the tip/tumble kinematics (refer to section 4.2.X). Upper rails have threaded studs attached to them, serving as attachment points for the cushion riser brackets during assembly. The inboard track slides incorporate a rear bracket that anchors the seatbelt buckle.

A threaded rod runs through the assembly and connects to the lower rail, both front and rear. A gearbox is affixed to the threaded rod, enabling fore/aft movement between the two track rails. Ball bearings are located between the rails to ensure smooth articulation.

Materials used for the main components are listed below:
- **Slide rails**: Material grade CR700Y980T-DP (VDA 239-100), thickness 1.0mm, manufactured by Shanghai Mingfang, China.
- **Attachment feet**: Material grade S550MC (EN10149-2), thickness 3.5mm, manufactured by Shanghai Mingfang, China.
- **Upper brackets**: Material grade S550MC (EN10149-2), thickness 2.5mm, manufactured by Shanghai Mingfang, China.

The power track slides are produced by Shanghai Mingfang, China, with the following specifications:
- **Forward locking strength**: >19,000N.
- **Rearward locking strength**: >17,000N.
- **Static load strength**: >713Nm.
- **Travel range**: 110 mm total.

The power tracks are powered by a motor cross brace sub-assembly, consisting of a steel pressing crossmember that carries a motor and two drive splines.

4 FEATURES, PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERISTICS  

4.1 Sub-systems and Functional Attributes  

4.1.3 Fore/aft adjustment (track slide).  
The power track slides, consisting of one inboard and one outboard assembly, feature upper and lower slide rails. The lower rails attach to a lower carrier that provides the tip/tumble kinematics (refer to section 4.2.X). These upper rails include threaded studs for attaching cushion riser brackets, and the rear bracket on the inboard track slides incorporates the seatbelt buckle anchorage.  

A threaded rod runs through the center of the assembly, connecting the front and rear to the lower rail. A gearbox, situated on the threaded rod, drives the fore/aft movement between the two track rails. Smooth articulation is maintained via a set of ball bearings positioned between the two rails.  

Materials used for the main components are as follows:  
- **Slide rails**: CR700Y980T-DP (VDA 239-100), Thickness: 1.0mm, Manufacturing Source: Shanghai Mingfang, China.  
- **Attachment feet**: S550MC (EN10149-2), Thickness: 3.5mm, Manufacturing Source: Shanghai Mingfang, China.
