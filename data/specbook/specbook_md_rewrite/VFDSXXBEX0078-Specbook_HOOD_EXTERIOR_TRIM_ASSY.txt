### 3.4.1 Corrosion
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VinFast Trading and Production LLC (“VinFast”).

For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  

Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in the lowest positions.  
Also avoid dirt traps where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro movements.  

Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.  

**Edge coverage:** Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.  

#### Corrosion tests:  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

- **Component test for metallic surfaces:**  
  - **Salt spray test:** ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.

### Electric Parts
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as control units in wet locations, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (e.g., Gortex).  

#### Guidelines for Corrosion Prevention:
- **Material combinations:** Ensure no galvanic corrosion occurs, including fasteners and attached brackets.  
- Avoid direct contact with noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness.  
- Surface treatment on steel fasteners should provide long-term corrosion resistance and compatibility with other materials.  
- **Installation of electrical components:** Ensure vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  

#### Terminals and Connectors:
- Place terminals away from lowest points.  
- Corrosion protection of terminals is required for tightness to prevent humidity exposure.  

#### Groundings:
- Grounding surfaces must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.  

### Aluminium Sealing Surfaces
Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content > 1% should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces as they are highly prone to corrosion. Corrosion could penetrate the seal quickly, allowing moisture to enter.

### Stone Chipping Issues
This section serves as a prevention guideline for stone damage on components involving seals and painted surfaces.
Page 11
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:  
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.  
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.  
- In areas of high stone-hitting risk, choose part materials and paint which have the same color, to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.  
- Avoid developing parts which have edges pointing in the vehicle’s driving direction.  
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them, so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.  

### 3.4.2 Environmental Compatibility
The minimization of environmental impacts of a product through the complete life cycle is a key factor for future development of innovative products.  

A minimization of environmental impacts of a product requires:  
- Use of recyclable materials.  
- Use of recycled materials and renewable resources.  
- Prevention of hazardous substances.  
- Minimization of compartment emissions including odor.  
- Minimization of consumption of resources.  
- Strategy for waste prevention.
