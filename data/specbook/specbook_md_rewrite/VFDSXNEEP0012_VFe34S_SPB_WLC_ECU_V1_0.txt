Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details have to be reported immediately. The contractor is a ‘System Development Supplier,’ with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

### 2.2 Initial Situation and Objective
The Wireless Charger provides charging voltage for any Qi standard-certified mobile device. The system is planned for use in various vehicle models, for various country-specific packages, and for various combinations of optional equipment. Adaptation of system functions to a given vehicle shall be accomplished by modular component population of the necessary modules and coding via the diagnostics interface. 

The design of the WLC shall avoid noise generation like squeak and rattle, as well as noise generation due to the moving parts. Furthermore, the electronics shall be designed to work without a fan or external cooling under the required temperature conditions.

### 2.3 Classification of the System / Component
There is only one WLC variant.

### 2.4 Execution Regulations
Not applicable.

### 2.5 Development and Supply Scope

Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  
The recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

5.16.3 Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization.  
To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided for via the diagnosis interface / central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:  
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks; check of deployment per component).  
- After deployment of the pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that are classified as toxic waste or hazardous substances according to the status of valid waste legislation. Otherwise, components must be dismantled and disposed of separately.  
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle via feedback at the deployment tool).  
- Marking positions of pyrotechnical components (especially “hidden” components, e.g. battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest).  
- In case of non-deployment, removal of pyrotechnical components is required. Pre-dismantling shall be avoided, and fasteners must be accessible.

5.16.4 Eco-Design.  
Parts Marking.  
Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are enclosed within arrowed brackets, using mathematical symbols for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<).  

5.16.5 Lifecycle Analysis.  

5.16.6 Emissions & Toxicology.

Page 31
5.16.3 Eco-Design.  
**Parts marking.**  
Parts marking should be carried out using the rule "as few characters as possible but as many as necessary." The marking consists of brief type designations defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, consisting of the mathematical signs for "more than" (>) and "less than" (<).

5.16.4 Lifecycle Analysis.  
**Emissions & Toxicology.**  
**Harmful substances in components and materials.**  
The emission behavior of the E/E product with direct contact to the interior compartment must be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment must be minimized accordingly.

Required measurements to confirm the emission characteristics must be conducted by the supplier in agreement with VinFast's specialist department. Measurements must be performed at VinFast-approved testing institutes. It is recommended to obtain an overview of all approved testing institutes from VinFast. Additional requirements can be found in project-specific documents (e.g., Emission Guideline).

Volatile organic compounds of components must be checked according to ISO12219. Conformance to prohibited substances must be ensured throughout the complete product lifecycle. The test results are evaluated by VinFast's specialist department. Harmlessness of volatile compounds for human health must be attested in writing on demand. The supplier must provide VOC and fogging measurement results for the materials before milestone purchase release.

5.17 Mechanical Requirements.  
5.17.1 **Load.**  
**Operating loads.**  
Operating loads are the loads experienced during intended vehicle use. These loads are derived from measurements taken with selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast. The definition of customer usage is based on VinFast's standard for long-distance durability runs. The tested mileage derives from the target for desired customer vehicle mileage as specified in chapter 5.18.

**Special events.**  
Special events are occurrences with a small frequency (approximately < 100) and are part of the vehicle's intended use, such as ABS-braking. Vehicles must be dimensioned such that special events neither affect functionality nor cause any safety-relevant damages. The intended service life must remain unaffected.

**Misuse events.**  
Misuse events refer to occurrences outside the vehicle's usage intention, such as curbstone impacts. The vehicle must be dimensioned to ensure:  
- Damages following misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel or wheel inclined conditions).  
- A defined damage chain is upheld after misuse (e.g., easy-replaceable parts before the body structure).  
- Cracks or damages occur alongside clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or to neighboring components ("deformation before break" principle).
Page 32
5.17 Mechanical Requirements.

5.17.2 Vibration Behavior.  
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 30Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VinFast. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.  

5.17.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics.  
Not applicable.  

5.17.4 Deformation.  
Not applicable.  

5.17.5 Pressure.

5.17.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance.  

**Fan.**  
If the electrical control unit contains cooling fans, no tonal frequency bands are acceptable (adjacent bars must not be exceeded by 3dB).  

**S&R, General.**  
Noises which are perceived by the customers as disturbing have to be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier has to guarantee that components are free of disturbing noises within their vehicle environment and geometrical integration under all environmental conditions throughout the component's service life.  

There must be no squeak and rattle noise due to excitation of the car body (e.g., wind load, torsional flexing), even if real relative movements on the surface occur. This has to be guaranteed under all operating and environmental conditions, including variations in temperature and humidity. To evidence disturbing noise freedom, the requirements must be coordinated with the responsible testing team.  

The supplier is responsible for supporting the development of vibration and acoustic behavior for the subsystem within the complete vehicle environment and ensuring consistent acoustic quality of delivered parts. This includes actively identifying issues and proposing solutions. Necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation must be delivered free of charge upon request.

5.18 Durability / Life Time.

Environmental operating conditions.
The environmental operation conditions for complete vehicle are defined as -30°C to +50°C ambient temperature, 0-100% relative humidity and -100m to 3500 m above mean sea level.

Heat protection.
The development and validation of the heat protection in the complete vehicle ensures that all relevant component temperatures remain below the maximum allowed limits, which are derived from vehicle operation within the environmental operating temperatures. 

Thermal management is very crucial for the WLC. It should show the thermal strategy and simulation result using junction temperature, not only operating ambient temperature.

The heat protection validation tests for the components are performed in the climatic wind tunnel (CWT) and on-road. 

All relevant component temperatures and measurement points have to be defined in accordance with the responsible modules and will be specified in respective component specifications. Vehicle tests have to be completed and followed VF Thermal Testing Standard in the MULE, Super-MULE, and PTO Vehicle Generation.
