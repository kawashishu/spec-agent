6.5 Physical System Environment / Mechanical Interfaces.

The mechanical design elements affecting the safety and reliability of EV battery packaging are outlined. Forces such as mechanical vibration, impact energy, and ambient temperature variations interact with the battery pack through various interfaces. These interactions must be controlled for a safe and reliable battery pack operation. Restricting battery cell movement is identified as one of the effective strategies for achieving a higher degree of protection against these forces. Mechanisms used to restrain battery cell movement are presented.

The battery pack is assembled into the Body in White of the vehicle using bolts M12 and M8 (refer to section 5.3.2). The assembly includes the electrical accessories: HV connector, LV connector, and ground harness cable.

The BMS shall:
- Sense thermal parameters related to the thermal coolant inlet and outlet temperature and pack mean temperature.
- Identify the thermal power demand and coolant flow rate required to operate the battery pack at the target temperature.
- Send this information to the external thermal control unit (VCU).

The HV Battery thermal system shall support:
- Keeping the battery cells in a 20°C – 35°C cell temperature range ideally without running into thermal derating while charging from the grid and driving.
- Bringing cell temperatures into a 20°C – 35°C cell temperature range within 30 minutes after temperature soaking to low/high temperature.

### Recycling
#### Dismantling Scheme
The dismantling scheme which must be provided by the supplier has to show a simple, unmixed dismantling of the component as well as its accessibility when assembled. Additionally, information regarding joining techniques, dismantling tools, etc., must be stated in the dismantling scheme / dismantling concept.

Dismantling schemes must be provided on demand to the environmental specialists at VinFast before milestone PTO (Production Try-Out).

#### Recycled Materials
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  
Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recyclates and post-production recyclates, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) have to be preferred in respect to availability on the market. Recycled materials have to be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance expert’s team at VinFast.

#### Recycling Scheme
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.

Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  
Recycling schemes must be provided to the environmental expert team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### 9.4 Material Requirements & Corrosion
Please refer to the VinFast Request for Quotation and to Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VINFAST TRADING AND PRODUCTION JOINT STOCK COMPANY (“VinFast”). 

#### Corrosion Requirements
The corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
Page 69
2. Corrosivity Medium: Used when the position is moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.

3. High corrosivity: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. Very high corrosivity: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

The vehicle exterior is generally considered an area with high corrosivity. Material combinations shall be chosen to prevent galvanic corrosion, including fasteners and attached brackets. Proper coatings like paint, plastic coatings, or insulating spacers must be applied for critical material combinations. Ensure water and dirt drainage in lowest positions, avoid dirt traps, and minimize abrasive micro movements. Contact surfaces must be dry, non-abrasive, and large enough for low pressure. Paint systems must provide good edge coverage.

### Corrosion Tests:
Parts must pass system/component tests and complete vehicle corrosion tests.

#### Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:
- **Salt Spray Test**: ISO9227, acceptance criteria provided below.

#### For Organic Coatings:
- **Cyclic Corrosion Test (CCT)**: ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria provided below.

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test Criteria:
| Area                     | Corrosivity          | Metallic Coatings           | Organic Coatings         | Pass Criteria      |
|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low                  | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227       | 96 h → ISO6270 CH         | No red rust        |
| Exterior, engine compartment, underbody, wet area | Medium | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227       | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust   |
| High/not visible for customer      | High | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227       | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B | NSS: No red rust   |
| High/visible, very high            | Very High | 720 h NSS → ISO 9227 | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B + stone-chipping protection where needed | NSS: No red rust, CCT: see below |
Page 70
Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:
- Rust creep according to ISO4628-8:
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1 - 2 mm.
- Blistering:
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).
- Edge corrosion:
  - ≤ 10%.
- Weld seam corrosion:
  - ≤ 5%.
- Degree of rusting:
  - ≤ Ri 1 (according to ISO4628-3).

Stainless steel:
Avoid direct contact with other metals (galvanic corrosion); in most cases, an insulating coating is needed. Test criteria for high visible parts: 720 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface. Check especially areas with crevices. Execute component tests with assembled sub-systems, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

Aluminium parts:
- Aluminium parts in high visible areas have to be painted or anodized.
- Test criteria Painted Aluminium: see test criteria for organic coatings.
- Test criteria Anodized Aluminium: 480 h NSS ISO 9227 without change of surface.
- Execute component tests with assembled sub-systems, where possible, and in a position as installed on the vehicle.

Chromed metal parts:
- 240 h NSS ISO9227 without base material corrosion.

Chromed plastic parts:
- CASS-Test according to DIN EN ISO 9227; duration:
  - 48 h for Exterior.
  - 24 h for Interior.
- Acceptance criteria: no surface defects.
- Also: 240 h NSS ISO9227 without surface defects.

Electric parts:
Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness-resistant membrane (type Gortex) when in wet locations. Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets.
Page 71
Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion. Terminals and connectors should not be placed at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness; electrical connections must be protected from humidity.

Groundings: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.

Aluminium/sealing surfaces: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content greater than 1% are highly sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components with sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal very quickly, allowing moisture to enter.

### Prevention of Stone Chipping Issues:
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized using design measures:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone hitting risk, choose part materials and paint that have the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle, deepen them so that they cannot be easily hit by stones.
