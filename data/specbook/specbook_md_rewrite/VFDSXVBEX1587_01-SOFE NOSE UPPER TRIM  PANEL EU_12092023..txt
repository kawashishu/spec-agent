EMC.

NO.

NVH.

1. The acoustic and vibrational behavior has to fulfill the demands needed to reach the complete vehicle targets. Therefore, the overall behavior has to be equivalent or better than the benchmark.  
2. The system has to be designed to be acoustically unobtrusive under all work conditions, including particularly rattling, squeaking, tone noise, whine noise, groaning, whistling, actuation-noise, and grinding noise. Sound pressure level and pitch must not fluctuate (modulation).

Safety.

Product(s) or system(s) comply with applicable regulations: FMVSS, NCAP, ECE.

Serviceability.

Refer to Service Manual.
