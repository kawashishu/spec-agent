3.2.1 General Design and Functionality.

The development object includes the rear wheel support assemblies. The wheel support is a structural component to absorb and transmit forces and torques from the wheel. It is the connection between the wheel bearing unit and the wheel suspension. It also includes interfaces for the wheel speed sensor, dust shield, and brake caliper.

The design concept is an aluminum casted part. The rear wheel support is designed for a multi-link axle with an air spring concept.
