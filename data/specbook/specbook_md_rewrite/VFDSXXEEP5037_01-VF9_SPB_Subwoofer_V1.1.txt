2 General Project Guidelines.

2.1 Development Scope Abstract.
This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the subwoofer. The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics. The Contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements. Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details have to be reported immediately. The contractor is a "System Development Supplier," with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

2.2 Initial Situation and Objective.
The system is planned for use in various vehicle models, for various country-specific packages, and for various combinations of optional equipment. Adaptation of system functions to a given vehicle shall be accomplished by modular component population of the necessary modules and coding via the diagnostics interface. The design of the subwoofer shall avoid noise generation like squeak and rattle as well as noise generation due to the moving parts. Furthermore, the electronic shall be designed to work without a fan or external cooling under the required temperature conditions.

2.3 Classification of the System / Component.
Refer to 5.1 Technical requirement.

2.4 Execution Regulations.
VF9 will be developed for Vietnam, US/Canada, and EU markets. Consequently, all amplifiers should consider the regulations and demands of both EU and US markets.

2.5 Development and Supply Scope.
The supplier status is "System Development Supplier," which means that the supplier has complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.  

This responsibility includes the following:
- Define, develop, 3D-design all parts within the system.
- Create release drawings.
- Ensure the function of the system.
- Perform any required simulations or calculations on a system level.
- Validate the system according to the technical targets and tests stated in this specification.
- System timing (in terms of project management, development, and industrialization).

The agreed work-share is documented in the section “Work interface chart."

5.16.3 End of life treatment  
**Dismantling scheme**  
VinFast requires that suppliers propose dismantling schemes for all parts and systems which address the removal, recycling, and disposal phases of end-of-life treatment.

Suppliers must meet the defined dismantling criteria by considering environmental impact reduction and optimized recycling conditions. The dismantling scheme must identify and evaluate the separation of hazardous substances, consistent with the latest environmental regulations.

**Recycling requirements**  
All components require alignment with national rules for recycling and recovery. The focus must be reduced environmental impact and maximum reclaimable material efficiency through innovative recycling technologies.

Suppliers must ensure proper material separation technologies compliant with VinFast's specifications, especially for multi-component systems.

**Depollution and hazard removal**  
Components must comply with national depollution regulations to avoid environmentally harmful material releases during dismantling. Hazardous substances require identification and separate recycling measures to ensure safe disposal.

Details and official regulations for dismantling, recycling technologies, and environmental standards are defined in Chapter 6 of this specification book.

VinFast Released
Page 26
5.16.2 Dismantling Scheme.  
The dismantling scheme describes the requirements to the contractor in terms of a simple, unmixed dismantling of the component as well as its accessibility when assembled. Dismantling scheme has to be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

5.16.3 Recycling Scheme.  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  

The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. Recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental experts team at VinFast before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

5.16.3.1 Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization.  
To ensure a cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided via the diagnosis interface / central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:  
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks / check of deployment per component).  
- After deployment of the pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that shall be classified, according to the status of the respectively valid waste legislation, as toxic waste or hazardous substances (otherwise the components shall be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances).  
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle/via the feedback at the deployment tool).  
- Marking of positions of pyrotechnical components (especially “hidden” components, e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest).  
- In case of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is required. In this case, pre-dismantling, if technically possible, shall be avoided (accessibility of fasteners).  

5.16.3 Eco-Design: Parts Marking.  
Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations which have been defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<).

5.16.5 Emissions & Toxicology.  
The emission behavior of the E/E product with direct contact to interior compartment has to be checked on representative components as soon as possible. Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment have to be minimized accordingly. Required measurements for confirmation of the emission characteristics have to be done by the supplier in agreement with the specialist department of VinFast. The measurements have to be done at testing institutes approved by VinFast. It is recommended to obtain an overview of all approved testing institutes from VinFast. Additional requirements can be found in project-specific documents (e.g., Emission Guideline).  

Volatile organic compounds of components have to be checked according to ISO12219. The conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured through the complete product life cycle.  

The test result is evaluated by the specialist department of VinFast. In any case, the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health has to be attested in written form on demand. The supplier has to provide measurement results regarding VOC and Fogging for the materials before the milestone purchase release.

5.17 Mechanical Requirements.  

5.17.1 Load.  

**Operating loads**  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VinFast.  
The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.  

**Special events**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g., ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.  

**Misuse events**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g., curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g., easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or at neighboring components (principle “deformation before break”).  

---

5.17.2 Vibration Behavior.  

**NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior**  
The maximum vibration level is to be defined by the supplier (brackets must be developed to avoid resonances below a certain frequency).
Page 28
The eigenfrequency of the component when mounted to the vehicle shall not be less than 35Hz. Thus, the supplier has to align the fixation concept with VF. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.

5.17.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

5.17.4 Deformation  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

5.17.5 Pressure  
No additional requirements from Operational Strength, Stiffness, Fatigue.

5.17.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance  
**Fan**  
If the electrical control unit contains cooling fans so there are no tonal frequency bands acceptable (adjacent bars must not be exceeded by 3dB).  

**Audio Acoustics**  
Leakage and rattle-free mounting of the speakers must be possible (wide basket mounting interface, foam ring attached to basket, rigid basket material). Basket front side must allow sealed connection to speaker grille (i.e. through flat surface or foam ring attached).  
The component must be stable over time. No deformation or shrinkage over time, temperature, moisture, dirt, UV radiation allowed. Glues must keep the specified adhesion. This is especially valid for the membrane, suspension, voice coil, dust cap, and membrane glue.

**Req ID**  
30560  

**Check-in date**  
11.07.18  

**S&R, General**  
Noises which are perceived by the customers as disturbing have to be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier has to guarantee that his components are free of disturbing noise in their vehicle environment and their geometrical integration. Similarly, at vehicle- and audio system excitation under all environmental conditions and over the fixed component service life. There even must not squeak and rattle noise due to excitation of the body (wind load, torsional flexing, etc.) if there evolve real relative movements on the surface. This has to be guaranteed over the whole operating- and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity). To evidence the disturbing noise freedom, the requirements must be coordinated with the responsible testing team.  
The supplier is responsible to support the development of vibration and acoustic behavior of the subsystem within the complete vehicle environment and has to ensure constant acoustic quality of delivered parts. This includes the active support of pointing out problems as well as making proposals to solve it actively. He has to deliver necessary parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation as requested free of charge.
