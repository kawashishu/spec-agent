3.2 Technical requirement.

The ASU Assembly is assembled from general assembly. Its purpose is to provide pressurized air for the air springs and to control their pressure. Its main part is the compressor unit, which is mounted to a bracket via special isolators. The bracket itself is attached to the body. On this bracket also mounted is the valve block for controlling the high pressure, coming from the compressor, separately for each air spring. All parts and technical information are shown below.

Page 10
4 Testing and validation and DVP&R.

Not applicable (carry over parts).

4.1 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts.  
AAR is a PPAP deliverable.  
The AAR process is described in the VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing).  
For each step of the process, the supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval.  
The process will start in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS.  
The supplier has to include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.

5 Function Safety, Homologation, and safety regulations.

Safety is one of the key issues in the development and integration of automotive functionalities. Functional safety is concerned with E/E systems.

5.1 Functional Safety Requirements.  
The supplier shall ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet ISO 9001 standard, Quality management system requirements for automotive production.  
ISO 26262:2018 not applicable, since parts were developed before the introduction of the specific standard.

5.2 Deliverables for Functional Safety.  
ISO 26262:2018 not applicable, since parts were developed before the introduction of the specific standard.

5.3 Homologation and safety regulation requirements.  
Parts are carried over from VN24 (S&S) and originally developed for another OEM. When this development was done, homologation and safety regulation activities had not been part of the supplier's scope. Since the parts are carried over, no homologation and safety regulation activities can be performed or requested from the supplier.
