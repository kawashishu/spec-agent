3.7.4 Interface to vehicle electrical system.

The front seats interface to the vehicle’s overall electric & electronic network via a 24-pin hybrid connector.

The vehicle’s E&E CAN network has two sub-components (ECUs) mounted to the front seats:
1. **PSM_D (Power Seat Memory Module)** mounted within the driver’s seat.
2. **SHVU_F (Front Seat Heating & Ventilation Control Unit).**

Additionally:
- An Occupant Detection Sensor (ODS) is mounted within the passenger seat cushion (Vietnam variants), forming part of the Seatbelt Reminder system (SBR).
- An Occupant Classification Sensor (OCS) is mounted within the passenger seat cushion (North America variants). This sensor provides the same function as the ODS but also assists the Airbag Control Module (ACM) with airbag deployment and suppression logic by detecting the occupancy status of the front seats.

For details regarding CAN communication system inputs and outputs to the front seats, refer to the E&E Network Spec Book.

### 3.8 Product Safety

The seating system design is developed following the considerations of IATF 16949 section 4.4.1.2 regarding product safety and the related steps using dFMEA, with suitable checks and validation as preventative actions to mitigate each potential failure mode. 

The process was initiated in steps starting with the P-diagram and interface matrix, which were used to generate a function tree as the index basis for the dFMEA itself.

### 3.8 Product Safety

The seating system design is developed following the considerations of IATF 16949 section 4.4.1.2 regarding Product Safety and the related steps using dFMEA, with suitable checks and validation as preventative actions to mitigate each potential failure mode.

The process was initiated in steps starting with the P-diagram and interface matrix to generate a function tree as the index basis for the dFMEA itself:

#### P-Diagram
The P-diagram outlines factors such as material property variations, subsystems like vehicle floor and airbag systems, environmental conditions (ambient temperatures, road vibrations), and user-related variables (compression from seated occupants, wear from ingress/egress). It also considers the potential error states such as failing to meet occupant needs or excessive structural fatigue, along with the control factors used in mitigating these risks.

### Function Tree

The function tree illustrates the following key objectives:
1. **Protect Occupant in Passive Conditions**  
   Factors governing occupant sitting mass, occupant head load, and adjustments such as recline and height adjust.
   
2. **Protect Occupant in Crash Events**  
   This covers dynamic conditions like crash events and displacement of luggage, along with crash-related occupant safety mechanisms.

3. **Provide Comfort and Easy Utility Features**  
   Includes lumbar support, heating, ventilation, and forward tilting adjustability.

4. **Allow Practical Assembly and Features**  
   Incorporates features like ease of assembly and alignment specifications.

5. **Meet Vehicle Integration Targets**  
   Ensures compatibility with vehicle designs and operational targets.

6. **Allow Serviceability**  
   Facilitates maintenance and replacement tasks.

7. **Meet Program Attribute Targets**  
   Adherence to styling targets and functional ergonomics.

8. **Meet Regulatory Requirements**  
   Compliance with global regulatory specifications listed for various regions.

#### Interface Matrix

The interface matrix evaluates interactions between the driver's seat, passenger's seat, center console, BIW floor, seatbelts, vehicle occupants, and child seats. It classifies interactions as:
- **Necessary for Function (+2)**  
- **Beneficial but Not Necessary (+1)**  
- **Does Not Affect Functionality (0)**  
- **Causes Negative Effects (-1)**   
- **Prevention Required (-2)**  

Each corner of the matrix specifies the interaction type based on parameters such as physical contact (P), information exchange (I), energy transfer (E), or material exchange (M).
Page 24
Included in the dFMEA are the following considerations to mitigate potential product safety concerns: 

- Cross-check of all historical product recall campaign failure causes (NHTSA and Rapex) from the past 10 years, to ensure their inclusion in the FMEA. 

- Function group 9 lists every regulatory requirement’s failure-to-comply mode as a line item in the FMEA. 

- Failure causes extending into component sub-supplier’s scope have been cascaded through the Special Characteristic Agreement (SCA) document for tracking and auditing within their respective organization, per IATF 16949 Product Safety standards. This is committed within Vinfast’s Statement of Requirements at nomination as well as Purchasing Terms & Conditions agreements. 

### 3.9 Functional Safety

Functional Safety is managed and audited at the system level by a dedicated team in Vinfast to ensure compliance with ISO 26262 requirements. 

Elements of the front seats subject to Functional Safety verification are: 
- Seat Memory ECU (PSM_D) – ASIL A requirement to prevent unintentional seat movement. 
- Occupant Classification Sensor (OCS) – ASIL requirement to ensure the correct occupancy status is signaled to the Airbag Control Module (ACM).

4 FEATURES, PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERISTICS.

4.1 Sub-systems and Functional Attributes.

4.1.1 Frame Structure.
The front seat structure consists of two main elements: the cushion chassis and the seat back frame. The two elements are joined via 4X M12 bolts. As an added safety measure, to mitigate risks of bolts loosening during service life, the bolts include a thread lock patch.

The back frame consists of two side members, two crossmembers, a fixed headrest tube, a pair of recliners (manual and power options), and a recliner driveshaft.

The ends of the crosstubes are permanently affixed to the sidemembers by using a 90-degree flaring process, with a low-friction bush placed in the interface to minimize stiffness in the rotating joint. The lower attachment points on the link arms also contain low-friction bushes, through which shouldered lockbolts + locknuts are installed to permanently attach them to pivot points on the attachment pressings of the track assemblies.

The cross-tube assemblies, with their link arms in the chassis assembly, provide a height adjustment function, which is driven by the height adjust mechanism. The outboard rear link contains a radiused toothed gear face, providing the interface for the geared coupling with the height adjuster.

To counteract the seat occupant’s weight whilst operating the height adjuster, a torsion spring is installed within the rear cross tube.
