### Emissions & Toxicology: Odor
Page 19
The odor behavior of the interior components has to be checked according to VDA 270. The tests must be agreed with the specialist department of VINFAST. The fulfillment of a target value <3 for odor according to this specification book has to be proved by the supplier via measurements. The supplier must provide measurement results regarding odor for components before the milestone purchase release. An optional test procedure to measure odor behavior of components can be defined according to ISO 12219, part 7, in alignment with VINFAST’s experts.

### Interior Parts Emissions (Bag Method)
- The emissions of interior components, semi-finished products, auxiliary means, and surface materials (foils, artificial leather, films) must be checked using the standard ISO 12219, part 2 ('bag method').
- Compliance with target values for interior part emissions per VINFAST’s specifications must be demonstrated by the supplier through defined measurements.

### Harmful Substances in Components and Materials
- The emission behavior of representative components must be checked as early as possible.
- Emissions of volatile organic compounds in the passenger compartment must be minimized accordingly.
- Measurements to confirm emission characteristics must be conducted by VINFAST-approved testing institutes.

Volatile organic compounds of components must be checked according to ISO12219. The conformance to prohibited substances is required throughout the product life cycle. The supplier must provide measurement results regarding VOC and Fogging for materials before the milestone purchase release. Limits for harmful substances emitted by concerned parts and components of the complete interior compartment are explained below:

#### Limits for Harmful Substance Emissions
| Component   | Odor VDA 270, 65°C [mark] | Fogging DIN72501-B [mg] | Bag Size [liter] | TVOC [µg] | Benzene [µg] | Toluene [µg] | Dimethylbenzene [µg] | Ethylbenzene [µg] | Phenyl ethylene [µg] | Formaldehyde [µg] | Acetaldehyde [µg] | Acrolein [µg] |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Headliner   | ≤ 3.0                     | ≤ 2                     | 2000             | Reporting  | 10           | 100           | 100                  | 25               | 30                  | 120               | 50               | 10           |

### Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization
To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, the recycling function for pyrotechnical components must comply with the following:
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks, check of deployment per component).
- After deployment, pyrotechnical components must not produce solid combustion residues classified as toxic waste or hazardous substances. Otherwise, the components must be dismantled and disposed of separately.
Page 20
A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle or via the feedback at the deployment tool. Marking of positions of pyrotechnical components, especially hidden ones such as battery safety terminal clamps and active safety headrests, is required. In the case of non-deployment, removal of pyrotechnical components is required, with pre-dismantling avoided if technically possible to ensure accessibility to fasteners.

### Recycling:

#### Recycled Materials:
When selecting materials, attention must focus on reducing material variety and ensuring compatibility with available recycling procedures (proven recycling technologies). Secondary raw materials, such as post-consumer recyclers and post-production recyclables (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics), are preferred based on market availability. Recycled materials must be marked according to defined parts marking standards in this specification book and reported to VINFAST's environmental compliance expert team.

#### Recycling Scheme:
This chapter establishes general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component. Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at the end of life. The provided recycling scheme needs to outline the possible recycling process of the component, including preferred recycling partners and cost estimations. The recycling scheme must be submitted to VINFAST's environmental experts team before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

### Material Requirements & Corrosion:

Please refer to the VINFAST Request for Quotation.

#### Additional Requirements:

##### Corrosion Requirements Interior:
- Screws, bolts on handles and mirrors
- Key
- Seat belts
- Trunk area
- Seat structure
- Invisible structural parts
- Vehicle tooling
Page 21
Generally: 
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. Corrosively Low: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. Corrosively Medium: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. High corrosively: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. Very high corrosively: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

Corrosion tests: 
The parts have to pass System/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

Component test for Metallic surfaces:
- Fog test: ISO6270 CH, acceptance criteria see below.
- Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria see below.

For Organic coatings:
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.
- Alternative tests possible if proposed by supplier and accepted by corrosion engineer.

Test criteria:

| Area                           | Corrosivity        | Metallic coatings                      | Organic coatings                  | Pass criteria               |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Interior, mounted parts, dry area | Low               | 240 h NSS → ISO 9227                 | 96 h → ISO6270 CH                | No red rust                |
| Exterior                      | Medium            | 480 h NSS → ISO 9227                 | 5 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B    | NSS: No red rust           |
| High & not visible for customer; / High & visible | High/Very High | 480/720 h NSS → ISO 9227          | 10 cycl. CCT → ISO11997 Cycle B  | CCT: See below             |

Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:
- Rust creep according to ISO4628-8:
  - Galvanized steel: d ≤ 4 mm.
  - Steel (non-galvanized) and aluminum sheet: d ≤ 1–2 mm.
- Blistering:
  - Blister size max. S2 (according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).
- Edge corrosion:
  - ≤ 10%.
Page 22
Weld seam corrosion requirements specify a maximum limit of ≤ 5%. Degree of rusting must be ≤ Ri 1, as defined in ISO4628-3.

The interior is primarily considered a dry area with low corrosively exposure. Exceptions include floor areas or locations subject to wetness, abrasions, or exposure to liquids from shoes or drinks that could produce corrosion. Combining different metals requires precautions to avoid galvanic corrosion, which can be achieved through proper coatings. Painted edges must be burr-free to ensure edge coverage and prevent wear.

The seat structure, particularly uncoated blank steel components, must remain corrosion-free, especially where visibility to the customer is possible. Areas prone to corrosion risk must not be visible, and all seat-rest positions must be considered. For other invisible sections, test criteria may be less stringent, but visibility of corrosive products in customer-facing areas must be avoided, and full functionality over the component’s lifetime must be guaranteed.

Vehicle tooling, typically stored in the trunk, is exposed to low corrosively. However, surfaces subjected to wear may experience medium corrosively exposure.

**Corrosion requirements on electric components are referenced separately.**

### Test Plan
The test plan outlines responsibilities, schedules, required testing equipment, and the visual presentation of results for continued monitoring. Control over test results must remain effective at all stages. If VINFAST demands independent verification, the SDS must provide the necessary parts at no cost.

The defined procedures and documentation must be approved by VINFAST’s validation and component lead engineers. The test plan must be supplemented with weekly updates during testing phases, and revisions are required upon development changes.

The SDS holds full responsibility for safeguarding its component, ensuring approval, and planning retesting when negative results occur. VINFAST requires access to all relevant test protocols/reports and may attend tests at SDS facilities. Deviations from approved test procedures must be agreed upon between VINFAST and SDS.

If testing utilizes incorrect, incomplete, or missing parts, the SDS must redo testing and bear associated costs. Negative test results require replanning, and retesting costs must also be borne by the SDS.

### DVP&R Data Inclusion
The DVP&R must include:
- Testing with declaration of standard, norm, or legal requirements.
- Detailed descriptions of test setups, including pictures depicting devices used during testing.
- Identification of the responsible test department.
Page 23
Where the testing was performed (internal/external).

Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).

Part variant, description of part.

Number of tested components/parts.

The SDS is responsible to use the DVP&R template provided by VINFAST testing department. The content of the DVP&R is in the responsibility of the SDS. The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart) and serial stage. 

In principle, the sequence of testing and the number of test specimens are to be determined in cooperation with the corresponding validation engineer and component lead engineer of VINFAST. The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VINFAST departments and the SDS. The DVP&R has to be agreed between the test department (VINFAST), SQA (VINFAST) and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R has to be reviewed weekly. In case of any scheduling delay, the SDS has to deliver proposals to fulfill the committed schedule. 

Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each single component.

**Testing**

**General**

The SDS prepares in time a detailed, backdated testing plan in consideration of the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 0). 

It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested! 

In order to prevent double testing, the mechanical and electrical tests have to be combined as far as possible.

Development parts or partial body structures necessary for testing at the SDS have to be stated in the quotation of the SDS in any case and ordered by the SDS from VINFAST. Unless otherwise expressly agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. 

Parts needed for testing activities at VINFAST test department have to be provided by the SDS free of charge. 

The SDS must assure all relevant legislations for only his component. Moreover, it has to be guaranteed that all internal VINFAST requirements in the performance specification are fulfilled. All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and committed to VINFAST. 

All relevant Vietnamese law obligations have to be achieved. 

All tests must be documented according to VINFAST standard, alternatively to SDS standard, if this is accepted by VINFAST. 

The SDS has to evaluate and perform the tests to be done for the serial development phase according to the specification. 

The tests have to be brought in the attached DVP&R template as an enclosure to the offer.
Page 24
Samples for sample inspections must be made available on time or no later than the agreed date, as coordinated with the test department.

VINFAST “Logistics” determines the number of sample parts, while VINFAST “Purchase” orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be included in the delivery.

The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to the DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS.

### Release by Test Departments
The responsible VINFAST test department will only release the components if the agreed test targets are met by the SDS during the complete vehicle integration tests. The SDS must submit positive test reports for all required tests according to the DVP&R. In case of problems (e.g., negative test results or wrong parameters/processes), the SDS must submit a test report with proposals for solutions to meet all milestones and targets. 

The first sheet of the report must clearly state an OK or NOK result.

### Analyses and Test Reports
The SDS is required to provide measurement reports following VINFAST specifications (VFDST00008900) [43] in electronic format, along with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts. 

After individual tests, the test samples must be analyzed in detail. The measurement and test results must be verified using individual values and documented in a test report. This report must be delivered to the responsible VINFAST department for release.

Both the results and the documentation of the tests conducted (initial sample inspections and any inspections carried out parallel to development) must be submitted upon request to the specialist department in charge of release. Tests conducted parallel to series production must be scheduled and documented at regular intervals or as required.

### Test Report/Information Requirements
- A description and pictures of the part, including documentation (part number, change index, materials, production process, additives like grease, and deviations from approved serial processes).
- All parts must be labeled with relevant descriptions.
- Reasons for testing, including past test reports (e.g., for negative test results).
- Accurate naming of testing standards, norms, legal requirements, or exact descriptions of agreed testing procedures.
Page 25
Documentation of result:
• Short description of the result, including pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of result OK/NOK, and pictures of the parts in testing position.
• Comparison with targets of the specification book, testing specification, legal requirements, etc.
• Recommendation for further actions based on results.
• Description of corrective measures or further approach in case of negative test results.
• Progress of testing status.
• Listing of all tests in a table with responsible person, part status, comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the SDS must provide a new date for re-test with countermeasures for approval by VINFAST, specifying the responsible person and company performing the test.

Periodic communication:
The VINFAST test engineer must be informed periodically with updates on actual testing status and progress. If VINFAST orders parts for testing independently, a detailed description of those parts must be attached.

Archival storage of tested parts:
Test parts can only be scrapped if agreed by the VINFAST test department. On request by a test engineer, the complete testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.

BIW-supports, testing devices, and equipment:
• The configuration and quantity of testing devices must be aligned with the testing department.
• BIW supports, provided by VINFAST, shall be utilized during testing.
• The structures involved in testing, including vibration testing devices, equipment for environmental testing, and long-term run structures, must be aligned with the test department.
• All testing equipment must adhere to corresponding testing instructions, and evidence of compliance must be provided by the SDS.

Test sample documentation requirements:
All test samples and reports must be documented with the following details:
• Drawing Number.
• Part Number.
• Release Number.
• Change Index.
• Production and Delivery Date.
• Documentation and designation adhering to VFDST00008700 [41].
• Tool revision state documentation.
• Measurement Report.
• DSR Development Sample Report VFDST00008800 [42].

Virtual testing:
• Suitable calculation techniques must be employed along with adequately detailed calculation models.
• These models, created by the SDS, should ensure the verification, securing, and optimization of component properties as defined in the technical specification, test procedures, and applicable regulations.
Page 26
Related to the mechanical properties of the component, such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, the properties are to be secured using FEM calculations. 

The tool-dimensioning for injection molding is optimized through corresponding simulations. Upon request, operative calculation models representing the respective development status must be made available to VINFAST technical departments for internal calculations and work integration. Suitable FEM models are to be provided by the SDS, without incurring extra costs, upon request from VINFAST.

Tests conducted by the SDS according to the evaluation plan are to be calculatively documented (e.g., using FEM) prior to tool dimensioning.

### Component Testing
These are basic required tests agreed upon in the DVP. The DVP has to be coordinated between VINFAST and the SDS, functioning as a binding agreement:
- Climatic change test according to VFDST00046100 [35].
- Sunlight simulation according to VFDST00053800 [37].
- Ageing of automotive components in solar simulation units as specified in DIN 75220 [13].

### Mechanical Integration Tests
Mechanical integration tests will be conducted on a complete vehicle:
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100) [35].
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800) [37].
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000) [48].
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00008500) [36].

No distortion or functional disturbance is allowed across the full functional temperature range. Using materials with high or differentiating thermal expansion coefficients must maintain geometric and functional consistency. The tolerances for flush and gap plans after climatic and solar simulation tests must not exceed defined limits.

These component tests indicate essential testing requirements. The detailed testing requirements will be outlined in the DVP agreed upon by VINFAST and the SDS.

Parts required for testing at VINFAST must be supplied by SDS free of charge.

### Geometrical Integration
The Reference Position System (RPS) classification of testing ranges occurs within the functional area. The goal is to maintain a consistent, repeatable, and customer-friendly method for determining assembly and component parts. An RPS-concept must be created as part of the SE-process with the quality assurance team. The RPS determination concept forms the foundation for component functionality during assembly. Adjoining component placement must align with the RPS-system (documented under VFDST00000011 [34]), corresponding to interior and BIW department standards.
Page 27
**Tolerance analyses:** The following tolerance analyses are necessary for single-component and complete systems including BIW and attachment points:  
- Static and arithmetic tolerance analyses.  
- Thermic change tests among all climate terms.  
- Thermal expansion has to be considered.  

Arrangements are necessary in order to ensure the required gap dimension of components.

**Sun visors:** Verification of the sun visor folding.  

**Grab handles:** Verification of the grab handle kinematic.  

**Clearance wiring harness:** A clearance of a minimum of 8 mm to the wiring harness is needed.  
Shape and position tolerances [15] and general tolerances [16] have to be considered.
