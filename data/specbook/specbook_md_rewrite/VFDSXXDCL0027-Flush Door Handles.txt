## Ergonomics

The complete vehicle must pass the ergonomic test based on VinFast's internal procedure. All dimensional and material changes that affect ergonomics on parts and modules must be communicated to VinFast immediately by the supplier for separate evaluation. All main ergonomic targets (e.g., ingress/egress, seating layout, armrest positions, steering wheel position, roominess definition) are derived through benchmark analysis of reference vehicles. The final sign-off of all ergonomic targets will be done in close cooperation with VinFast, which is responsible for both interior and exterior styling. VinFast ultimately approves targets through evaluations using the styling.

### 3.2.2 Functional Characteristics

The following primary function units are integrated into the outer door handle:
- **Door Opening:** This includes mechanical and electrical opening of the door.
- **Keyless Entry:** An electric locking and unlocking function (with button).

The visible part of the door handle should be painted to match the vehicle body color. The painting process will take place at VinFast. Final handle assembly will also be conducted by VinFast.

#### Operating Specifications:
- Via trigger position of defined %PWM with the outer actuating lever pulling, the system conducts opening as electronic sensor signals are sent to the ECU/DCU of the cinch latch.
- **Maximum Transferable Force:**
  - Up to 790N static in the "Y" direction without impairing functionality.
  - Up to 500N static in the "Z" direction without impairing functionality.
- **Operating Forces:** Necessary forces for the opening of the door lock in the vehicle (outer door handle system in the installed state) are specified as 30 ± 10N.
- The handle, without Bowden cable and latch, must have the same operating force as the reference settings.

### Additional Description:
