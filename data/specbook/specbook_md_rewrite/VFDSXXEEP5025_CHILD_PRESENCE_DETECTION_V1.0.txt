### 5 CPD System Description and Specification

#### 5.1 System Concept
The function of CPD is to detect the presence of occupants (including infants or children) in the defined detection area and notify the driver.  
If there is no response from the driver or connected persons, the CPD system sends warnings to the MHU, which activates and controls the alarming mechanism.  

A high-level functional architecture overview of the CPD system is provided. It includes sensing modules such as CPD radar, vehicle motion sensors, and body control inputs. These capture vehicle information and user inputs.  
Raw data is transmitted to the CPD ECU, processed, and forwarded to the MHU ECU to implement the warning strategy if an occupant is detected.  
Finally, warnings are issued through MHU ECU to internal and external systems, such as MHU, BCM, and Diagnostic systems.

---

#### 5.2 System Configuration
The CPD system includes part numbers, usage per car, procurement codes, applicability on VFe36 vehicle variants, and hardware-linked functions through color coding. It specifies the number and function location of components, safety-rated ASIL levels, and part information linked by unique company IDs following the EEPxxx format.  

The CPD system is tailored for BEV vehicles, with no component-level differences. EE integration and software development must adapt the CPD system to each vehicle type.

---

#### 5.3 CPD Function Description
Detailed descriptions of components and system architecture are included, covering functional topology, data structuring, CAN message details, and user-level operations.  

#### 5.3.1 Child Presence Detection (CPD)
Children are particularly vulnerable and often unable to escape locked cars. Heatstroke fatalities are prevalent among children under 4, especially compared to crash-related fatalities. In the US, the phenomenon of hyperthermia has generated strong demand for systems to detect children in cars and alert drivers to mitigate risks.
Page 8
### 5.3.1.1 Elements of Systems

The system consists of one radar mounted on the headliner of the vehicle to detect infants and children in the 2nd and 3rd seats. It is only available in the Plus variant in both US and VN markets.  
To warn the driver of the presence of the infants and children, the MHU shall control the warning strategy. MHU shall use headlamp blinking, T-box signaling, and honking signals to alert the driver of their presence inside the car.

### System Architecture and Operation Components
The system architecture is presented in Figure … The operation involves several components as follows:

#### Sensors:
- One radar scans the areas on the 2nd and 3rd seats and provides feedback on the presence of an infant or child.

#### MHU (Main Head Unit):
- **Control the warning strategy:**  
  - Warn users inside the vehicle via the MHU screen with short and long audible alerts.  
  - In case of no response from the driver, send a message to the BCM to activate external warnings.  
  - Send SMS alerts to connected persons.  
  - Receive input from user interfaces as confirmation (via pressing a button on the MHU).  

#### BCM (Body Control Module):
- **Control external warnings:**  
  - Activate headlamp blinking and honking signals when an external warning is required.  
  - Receive input from user interfaces as confirmation (via door opening or keyfob activation).  
  - Send door state input to initiate radar searching.

#### EMS/VCU (Electric/Vehicle Control Unit):
- Coordination with other modules and systems for signal processing and operational control.

**CPD Radar**  

**Details of System Operation and Alerts:**  
- If an occupant is detected and the vehicle stops through EPB status, the system will initiate a warning mechanism.  
- The MHU will start a timer dedicated to controlling the warning strategy.  
- MHU displays a message: "Please check rear seat" on its screen, complemented by short audible warnings to catch attention effectively.  
- If the driver does not respond after one minute of the timer running, long audible warnings commence to indicate urgency.  
- Lack of driver response during the timer intervals of 3, 4, 5, and 8 minutes triggers:
  - A message sent to BCM for exterior warnings, such as headlamp flashing and honking signals.
  - SMS alerts dispatched to connected persons.  
- BCM reacts by flashing vehicle headlamps and activating honking signals.  
- The system obtains confirmation from the driver through various avenues:
  - MHU screen interactions.
  - Door opening.
  - Keyfob signals.  
- Upon receiving confirmation, the warning process terminates and reinitiates after a 1.5-minute waiting period.  
- If the doors are opened while the timer is running, the timer resets to zero.  
- When the ignition (IGN) turns off, the system continues operation for 10 minutes before entering sleep mode.

5.3.1.5.1 Operational State Flow: UX Design

**OFF**
- Condition Check: CPD function will be switched off after 10 minutes from ignition (IGN) OFF. 
- State Description/Remarks: CPD function will be by default active in every engine start lifecycle.

**Standby**
- Condition Check: CPD function will be in standby state if the speed of the vehicle is greater than or equal to 10 km/h.
- State Description/Remarks: The system remains in standby mode, awaiting additional conditions.

**Active**
- Condition Check: In an active state when the system detects an occupant.
- State Description/Remarks: The system shall send a warning message to MHU. The MHU shall control the warning strategy, providing audible and visual notifications.

Visual Flow of HMI States:
1. **OFF State**: System is deactivated; no feedback provided.
2. **Standby State**: System activated but searching initiated; no feedback during searching state.
3. **Active State**: 
   - Occupant detected: Audible and visual feedback provided in MHU.
   - No occupant detected: No feedback or warning sent.
   - No response received after 3, 4, 5, and 8-minute intervals: Flashing lights, sounding horn, and sending text message to the driver via the T-box.
Page 16
5.3.1.5.1 Operational state flow: UX design.

The CPD system has three operational states defined below:
- **OFF:**  
  The CPD function will be switched OFF after 10 minutes from IGN OFF. By default, the CPD function will be active during every engine start life cycle.

- **Standby:**  
  The CPD function enters standby state if the vehicle speed is greater than or equal to 10 km/h.

- **Active:**  
  In the active state, when the system detects an occupant, it sends a warning message to the MHU. The MHU then controls the warning strategy.

5.3.1.5.2 Warning/Alert mechanisms for CPD.  

The CPD system alerts by combining various mechanisms:  
- **IPC notifications:** A visual "Child Detection - Check Rear Seats" notification icon.  
- **MHU notifications:** Flashing warnings and audible chimes to ensure the driver notices the alert.  
- **Climate area integration:** The alert visually merges and communicates seamlessly with other vehicle system feedback, improving visibility and driver responsiveness.  

The warning system utilizes icons (green), flashing signals (red), and chimes (green) for effective feedback.

Note: ADAS-specific warnings for cases such as RCT, DOW, FCW, LDW, RTS, ISA, BSD, FPS, RDS, DAM, OCD, and AHB fall under QM classifications.  

Diagnostic consideration for system and malfunction prevention:  
As per ISO 26262-4 clause 6.4.3.9:  
- Class C0 may be used for hazards addressing the unavailability of items if they do not affect the safe operation of the vehicle.  
- Control hazards should ensure these malfunctions are latent instead of actively affecting driver operations.  
- If the controllability class is assigned C0 (e.g., for driver assistance systems), no ASIL assignment is required.
