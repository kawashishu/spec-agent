**3.1 System Description**  
The major components of the cooling pack system are as follows:  
- Battery Radiator  
- EDS Radiator  
- Fan with Fan Shroud  

The primary objective is to minimize complexity while maintaining high component commonality. Suppliers are encouraged to use off-the-shelf components.

**Complete Cooling Module**  
The complete cooling module includes the following:  
- Fan  
- Fan Shroud  
- Radiator  
- Condenser  
- Carrier (if required)  

**Image of the Cooling Pack**
A pre-assembled representation of the cooling pack includes all necessary components put together for ease of integration.

**Cooling Circuit**  
The cooling circuit illustrates the system layout, including connections for pumps, tanks, chillers, and HVAC systems to support battery thermal management, EDS cooling, and high-voltage component requirements.

The system developer is responsible for designing solutions based on vehicle and design data, ensuring compliance with technical and commercial releases through change management. This validated cooling module adheres to the project's objectives for BEV variants.
Page 8
- Radiator for Battery cooling.

The objective is to minimize the complexity and high commonality. Suppliers shall prioritize the use of off-the-shelf components rather than developing new ones. The complete cooling module, including the fan, fan shroud, radiator, condenser, and carrier (if necessary), should be pre-assembled by the system supplier.

### 3.1.2 Function
The cooling module is a functional subsystem designed to meet thermal management requirements. Each component should be verified according to the following:

- **Fan:** Sufficient airflow should be provided at all driving conditions to support radiator heat exchange requirements.
- **Radiator:** Sufficient heat rate to air/from coolant while keeping coolant temperature after the radiator below 60°C. The coolant consists of 50:50 water and a long-life antifreeze.

A general requirement is that the air pressure drop should be as low as possible for all heat exchangers to enable a large airflow while minimizing fan power. Additionally, a low fan discharge temperature is required.

It is also important to note that program intentions include providing only a lower grill to support cooling performance. A generic requirement for the grill opening has been established and agreed upon between teams to best optimize cooling. The cooling module supplier is tasked with developing the system based on this requirement.

### 3.1.3 System Requirements
System suppliers must define characteristic curves/values that meet the thermal requirements for EDS, battery, and high voltage components.

The fan design features a multi-speed controlled fan for performance. A control signal is provided by the vehicle, and final specifications will be determined during development. 

#### Fulfilled Requirements:
- Airflow meeting the requirements of the cooling system, considering component temperatures and usage profiles (media and component cooling in all departments and throughout specified areas).
- Geometry compliance.
- Efficient electrical power consumption.
- Charge balance compatibility.
- Acoustic performance, minimizing vibrations and resonances.
- Durability according to operational profiles.
- Ease of service and repair.

Suppliers are responsible for the complete system development and ensuring all performance requirements are met through all development phases. The following activities must be led by suppliers:
- Concept creation system.
- Package refinement.

### Cooling Module
The grill opening projected area should cover more than 15% of the cooling module area.

### Characteristic Curves
System supplier has to define characteristic curve/values matching to vehicle overall resistance airflow. VinFast has to control performance by simulation and complete vehicle testing.

---

### Temperature Profile
A working fan is subjected to ambient temperatures between -40°C and +115°C. Placement of measuring points will be done at half the blade diameter (12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions), located before and after controller 1 cm away. The temperature is the mean value of these points.

#### The system shall withstand the following temperatures:
| **Temperature** | **Part of Lifetime** |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| 70-79°C         | 10%                |
| 80-89°C         | 35%                |
| 90-99°C         | 34%                |
| 100-110°C       | 15%                |
Page 12
Lifetime for the fan module is 10,000h. Electrical components should be chosen to withstand the temperature profile and lifetime.

### Requirements for components under the waterline:
- The cooling fan is located under the waterline and must therefore withstand being submerged during wading without affecting the normal service life.
- Parts from driving in deep water tests should be analyzed jointly by the supplier and VinFast team.
- The component shall have full functionality during and after the tests according to the component specification.
  
#### Purging Areas:
- Purging areas must be located above the waterline and/or be equipped with one-way valves or Gore-Tex type membranes.
- Water, snow, and dirt must not cause problems in any system or component during the vehicle’s entire service life.
- Components must withstand water spray and, in some cases, water splashes from wheels, and be submerged during wading.
- Use watertight connectors and, if necessary, protective shields to safeguard components.
- Earth and plus connections must be situated in dry and clean areas or be capable of withstanding water, dirt, and snow. Sensitive parts and electrical connections must be waterproof.

### Balancing:
- Residual imbalance shall be measured on the complete fan, where the unit shall be softly suspended (resonant frequency of suspension elements must be at least 4 times lower than the fan’s speed) or rigidly suspended in equipment insulated from vibrations from surrounding machines.
- All rotating parts shall be statically balanced.
- For the cooling fan, residual imbalance values may not exceed the specification as per ISO 1940-1:2003. Static balancing can be performed for the complete fan system.

#### Balancing Specifications:  
| **Static imbalance** | **30gmm** |  
- The maximum imbalance of the cooling fan should be controlled to less than **2g-cm**.

### Corrosion Requirement:
As this cooling pack is applicable for US applications, it should meet specific corrosion requirements.
