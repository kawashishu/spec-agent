### 4.3 Discharge Current and Power Limit Tables

The BMS software continuously sends on CAN the maximum discharge current and power that the battery can support. The value sent on CAN is based on the Current and Power Limit Tables, which show the limits according to temperature and SOC. 

Please note that the Current and Power Limit Tables provide the starting value for the BMS calculation for the Current and Power limits sent on CAN. The BMS will subsequently account for instantaneous cell voltages, temperatures, and SOH to calculate the actual current limits. Consequently, the values sent on CAN will often be lower than the values observed in these limits.

There are also additional de-rates applied based on the past actual power usage by the vehicle and on the BDU temperature.

#### Figure 4.1 Pack Discharge Current Limit Table (A)
The table displays allowable discharge current limits across various temperatures (from -30°C to 50°C) and SOC values (from 3% to 97%). Values are split into time-based intervals (10 seconds, 30 seconds, and 60 seconds).

**Purpose:** This figure illustrates the correlation between pack discharge current limits and operational conditions to ensure safe battery usage and optimal functionality under varying conditions.

## 4 Product Overview

### 4.3 Discharge Current and Power Limit Tables
The BMS software sends continuously on CAN the maximum discharge current and power that the battery can support. The value sent on CAN is based on the Current and Power Limit Tables, which show the limits based on temperature and SOC. 

Please note that the Current and Power Limit Tables provide the starting value for the BMS calculation of the Current and Power Limits sent on CAN. The BMS will then take into account the instantaneous cell voltages, temperatures, and SOH to calculate the actual current limits. Therefore, the values sent on CAN will be lower than the values observed in these limits. 

There are additional de-rates applied based on the past actual power used by the vehicle and on the BDU temperature.  

#### Figure 4.1 Pack Discharge Current Limit Table (A)
- The table provides discharge current limits across varying states of charge (SOC) and temperature conditions.
- Key entries specify limits for pulse durations (10 seconds, 30 seconds, and 60 seconds) in SOC ranges from 97% to 3%, under temperatures ranging from -30°C to 50°C.

### 4.4 Charge Current and Power Limit Tables
The BMS software sends continuously on CAN the maximum charge current and power that the battery can support. This is intended for the Regeneration function of the EV. For the Charge request (for DC fast charge), refer to the next chapter.

The Current and Power Limit Tables provide the starting value for the BMS calculation of Current and Power Limits sent on CAN. The BMS considers instantaneous cell voltages, temperatures, and SOH to calculate actual current limits. Therefore, the values sent on CAN will be lower than the values specified in these limits. 

Additional de-rates are applied based on the past actual power used by the vehicle and on the BDU temperature.

#### Figure 4.2 Pack Discharge Power Limit Table (KW)
- The table provides discharge power limits across varying SOC and temperature conditions.
- Entries include pulse durations for 10 seconds, 30 seconds, and continuous discharge in SOC ranges from 97% to 3%, under temperatures ranging from -30°C to 50°C.

### Summary of Current and Power Limit Tables  
The BMS software continuously sends the maximum charge current and power that the battery can support via CAN communication. These limits are crucial for electric vehicle regeneration functionality and DC fast charging capabilities. The values in CAN messages are influenced by instantaneous variables such as cell voltages, temperatures, and state of health (SOH). Consequently, actual limits observed may be lower than the theoretical values in the tables above.

Additional de-rates are applied due to factors such as historical power usage by the vehicle and the temperature of the battery distribution unit (BDU).

### HV Battery Pack Specification Document  

#### **4.5 Charge Request Current Table**  

When charging, the BMS sends to the vehicle system the maximum charging current that the RESS can support. The values are sent on CAN based on the Current Charge Map.  

Please note that the Current Charge Map provides the starting value for the BMS calculation for the Current and Power limits sent on CAN. The BMS will then take into account the instantaneous cell voltages, temperatures, and SOH to calculate the actual current limits. Therefore, the values sent on CAN are expected to be lower than the values observed in these limits.  

There are also additional de-rates applied based on the BDU temperature.  

#### **Figure 4.5 VF9 Current Charge Map (A)**  
The figure depicts a table showing SOC (State of Charge) percentages and corresponding maximum charging current values at different temperature intervals. Temperatures range from -20°C to 55°C, and the charging current limits vary by SOC percentage and temperature. At higher SOC levels and temperatures, the charging current limit decreases.

## 5.3.4 Venting interface

There is a venting interface on the RESS, which includes an air pressure equalization device (APED) and an external vent pipe for the project. The APED serves as a mechanism to prevent water ingress into the RESS when not functioning. If errors occur, such as leakage within the cells or refrigerant leakage inside the RESS, the APED also acts as the opening for degassing (EPED). 

**Key considerations:**
- The venting opening must remain unobstructed to avoid blockages.
- Sufficient distance to adjacent areas must be maintained.
- Escaping gases can be extremely hot and potentially burning.

The venting interface, along with its associated components and specifications, is depicted in Figure 5.7.

### VF Pack Venting Specifications
- **Main Structure:** Al6063 + VQM + SUS304
- **Gas-permeable Membrane:** e-PTFE
- **Ventilation Capacity:** Greater than 300 ml/min @ 2.5 kPa
- **Burst Pressure:** 4 ± 1 kPa
- **Operating Temperature:** -40°C to 85°C
- **Mounting Parameters:** M5*18, 6N.M
- **Flame Retardant Rating:** UL94-V0
- **Level of Protection:** IP68, IP9K

**Primary Function:**
The venting system helps balance the internal and external pressures of the pack. Additionally, the exhaust outlet prevents pressure buildup from internal chemical reactions. 

Figure 5.7 illustrates the venting interface and its placement within the RESS.
Page 26
### 5.3.5 Mounting Interface

The mounting interface of the CATL battery pack is designed to be compatible with the existing VF9 vehicle design, which has mounting points designed for the VinES/SDI battery pack. The mounting points in the side flanges and front corners are the same as the VinES/SDI battery pack. Two mounting points in the middle area are also the same.  

For the other mounting points in the middle area of the battery pack, it was not possible to use the existing vehicle mounting points; therefore, a new bracket was designed to ensure compatibility. The detailed interface is shown in **Figure 5.8**.

**Figure 5.8 Mounting Interface**

Additionally, the battery pack provides interfaces to mount the trust plate at the front, the gap hiders on the side, and the aero shield at the back of the battery pack, shown in **Figure 9**.

For detailed design including fixings, please refer to **VFDSXXBAT1279-VF9 BAT CATL HV Battery to BIW mounting reference document**.

6.2 BMS sw overview.  
The CATL battery BMS software has been designed to be compatible with the existing VF9 vehicle system designed for the VinES / SDI battery pack. This means the same signals in the dbc file are used to interface with the vehicle system. The diagnostics are similar to the VinES battery pack but adapted to the CATL battery pack, therefore there are specific DTCs added, thresholds have been adapted, and not relevant DTCs have been removed. Due to different battery packs characteristics (different energy, power and thermal characteristics), a different VCU cal is expected to be required.

The BMS software shall follow the following VinFast requirements:
- VFDSAAEEP0035_Flash_Specification  
- VFDSAAEEP0036_Coding_Specification  
- VFDSAAEEP0047_CAN_Specification  
- CES_VINFAST_EE_VFDSP50000037_Security_Access_Algorithm

## 8 Thermal Propagation and Runaway Detection.

### 8.1 Thermal Propagation Design.
The CATL battery pack has been designed to minimize the possibility of thermal propagation between cells. There is a gap between cells, and a thermal insulation pad is fitted. Space is provided for venting on top of the cell, along with a Mica protective layer.

*Measurements in the drawing above are indicative only and subject to change.*

### 8.2 Thermal Runaway Detection.
In the CATL B sample packs, thermal runaway was detected by monitoring cell voltages, temperatures, and communication faults in the Cell Supervisory Circuit (CSC). The list of conditions used to trigger the thermal runaway alarm is detailed below. The thresholds are calibratable.

#### Conditions to Trigger Thermal Runaway Alarm:
1. Vmin < xx V (xx s) & Tmax > xx °C (xx s) – Conditions met within 10 minutes.
2. Vmin < xx V (xx s) & Tmax-Tmin > xx °C (xx s) – Conditions met within 10 minutes.
3. Vmin < xx V (xx s) & dT/dt > xx °C/s (xx s) – Conditions met within 10 minutes.
4. Vmin < xx V (xx s) & Switch Circuit Open (xx s) – Conditions met at the same time.
5. Tmax > xx °C (xx s) & within xx s, CSC Communication Circuit Open (xx s).
6. dT/dt > xx °C/s (xx s) & within xx s, CSC Communication Circuit Open (xx s).
7. Tmax-Tmin > xx °C (xx s) & within xx s, CSC Communication Circuit Open (xx s).
8. Pack isolation fault & CSC Communication Circuit Open (xx s) – Conditions met within 10 minutes.
9. Tmax > xx °C (xx s) & CSC Communication Circuit Lost – Conditions met within 10 minutes.
10. dT/dt > xx °C/s & CSC Communication Circuit Lost – Conditions met within 10 minutes.
11. Tmax-Tmin > xx °C (xx s) & CSC Communication Circuit Lost – Conditions met within 10 minutes.

### 8.2 Thermal Runaway Detection

On the C sample design, VinFast requested to add a pressure sensor for thermal runaway detection. CATL utilizes a similar design for another OEM as well. 

The logic details for the new Thermal Runaway (TR) pressure sensor are listed below:
- TR sensor is integrated into the hardware of the BMS and powered directly by the vehicle's 12V power supply.
- When the BMS is active, it receives a pressure signal from the Battery Pressure Sensor (BPS) via SPI.
- In sleep mode, if the battery cell undergoes a thermal runaway, the BPS will hold the alarm signal until the BMS wakes up.
- After waking up, the BMS reviews and decides if there is evidence of thermal runaway.
- If thermal runaway is confirmed, the BMS will wake the VCU to deliver a vehicle warning.

#### Working Current:
- **Case 1: Sleep Mode**  
  Current: 200 µA  
  (Only for reference)
- **Case 2: Active Mode**  
  Current: 250 mA  
  (Only for reference)

Thermal Runaway testing was performed on both B sample and C sample hardware levels.
