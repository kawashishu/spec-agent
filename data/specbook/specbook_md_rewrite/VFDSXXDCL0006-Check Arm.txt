3.2 Technical requirement.  
3.2.1 Functional requirements.
- Operating temperature: -40°C to +80°C.  
- Mean variation of holding, momentum, and friction momentum changes must be smaller than 30% (for the temperature range and tolerance range).  
- Functionality secured by a temperature of up to 90°C for 2 hours.  
- Minimal number of notches: 2.  
- Up to a street angle of 30% (static), doors must remain in position (detent).  
- Doors must not drop back out of the end detent for an opening velocity of 1.2 m/s (measured at the door latch/striker point).  
- The system must have 3 stops in the front door and 2 stops in the rear door.  
- First front detent positioned by measurement W103 +450mm (450mm on each side, with subsequent detents measured similarly).  
- Second front detent located by measurement W103 +620mm.  
- Third front detent positioned at fully open door.  
- First rear detent positioned by measurement W103 +600mm.  
- Second rear detent positioned at fully open door.  
- Specification reference: VFDST00009100.  

3.2.2 Operational safety.
It must be ensured that the design does not endanger vehicle occupants or external persons during a defined crash situation caused by moved or displaced parts. Further, it must be ensured the door can open following the defined crash simulation.
Page 7
3 Requirements.

3.2.3 Product safety.
The door check is to be encapsulated for protection against external influences. The VinFast standard must be met.

3.2.4 Force and torque level.
The holding moment at each notch position will be reconciled on the prototypes in close cooperation with the testing department to ensure a harmonious force characteristic. When the vehicle is level and the door is not engaged, it must not leave the set position due to vibration in an uncontrolled manner. The door may not spring back from the end position at opening speeds of up to 1.2 m/s. At opening speeds up to 2.0 m/s, no noticeable change in system performance or structure is allowed. At operating speeds greater than 2.5 m/s, damage to the check arm is tolerated without influencing customer-relevant functions. Provision must be made for an end position impact damping facility to achieve necessary fatigue strength, and this must be agreed upon with the testing department. Measures should prevent re-swinging of the door by spring effect and pillar conjunction at defined opening speeds.

3.2.5 Weight.
The weight of the object of development must be less than 210 g.

3.2.6 Installation Space and Free Travel.
Adjacent components:
- Door in white (DIW).
- Window guide rail.
- Side windows.
- Body side frame, etc.

Minimum clearances to other components:
- Movable parts (like windows): 10 mm.
- Fixed parts: 5.0 mm.

3.2.7 Specification for design.
For all relevant parts and interfaces, tolerance investigations are to be conducted by the developer/supplier in cooperation with the appropriate MSF department.

3.2.8 Stiffness.
Customer-relevant vibrations of the system during driving operations and door slams are to be minimized by appropriate measures determined within the scope of development.

3.2.9 Ergonomic requirements.
The operation comfort of the door stop must be designed ergonomically.

3.2.10 Tightness.
Please refer to the VINFAST Request for Quotation and Part 1: General Project Requirements for Suppliers of VINFAST Trading and Production LLC.

3.2.11 Acoustics.
No disturbing noises are allowed. Noises perceived as unpleasant should be eliminated through the choice of appropriate material, surface, and design.

3.2.12 Corrosion.
The main requirements are defined in “VFDST00040300 Cyclic Corrosion Testing.”
Page 8
### Corrosion Requirements
Fulfillment of corrosion standards requires no dirt or water retention in installed conditions. Abrasions to the car body must be avoided. To ensure corrosion protection of the components in the complete vehicle, a corrosion durability run is conducted. 

In visible metallic-coated areas, components must withstand conditions without red rust as per "VFDST00041200 Saltspray." The systems should remain free of corrosion failures for a minimum of 10 years. Painted visible areas must pass 10 cycles of the VDA (climatic-change-test) 621-415 criteria.

3.7 Testing and Validation and DVP&R.

DVP and PC test responsibility follow RASIC. DVP (virtual and physical testing) for System, Sub-system & Component Level are aligned with the Complete Vehicle Specification book during the concept phase. A detailed test plan for hardware testing is required in file DVP&R and must be coordinated with the Testing & Validation department:
- Testing must declare standards, norms, and legal requirements.
- Description of testing setup with pictures specifying how and with which devices the testing was performed.
- Identification of the location where testing occurred (internal/external).
- Duration and timeline of testing represented as a project plan.
- Part variants and descriptions.
- Quantity of tested components/parts.

Testing must meet the Mileage Target Life requirement: 160,000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first).

"DVP_for Component" reference: VFDSXXDCL0106.

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for All Visible Parts.

AAR (Appearance Approval Report) is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is defined in VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts and timing). The supplier is responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design for review at each step of the process to ensure OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval. Timing for submission must be agreed upon with VF. This process begins in the early PT build phase to secure AAR approval at LS.

Suppliers must integrate this activity into their development process and ED&D cost considerations.

4 Function Safety, Homologation, and Safety Regulations.

Safety is a crucial element in the development and integration of automotive functionalities, particularly concerning E/E (Electrical/Electronic) systems.

4.1 Functional Safety Requirements.

The supplier shall guarantee compliance of developed/manufactured part(s) with the following standards:
