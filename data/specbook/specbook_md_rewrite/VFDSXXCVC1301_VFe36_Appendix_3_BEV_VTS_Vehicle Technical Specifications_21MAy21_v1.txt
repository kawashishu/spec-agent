**Range of Speed:**  
ACC operates from 0 to 150 km/h.

- Function deactivated by high brake force applied by the driver.  
- Ensures braking response prioritizes driver's braking commands.  

**System Design:**

- **Rear Crash FMVSS305 Requirements**: Measures include HV Battery State of Charge (SOC) and protection against electrolyte spillage and electrical shock. Performance criteria describe electrical isolation for AC and DC HV sources, with resistance and voltage thresholds ensuring safety. Physical barrier protection against shock must meet set resistance and voltage standards.

- **Laws Component Testing**: Covers FMVSS requirements for body block torso impact, seatbelt anchorage, door crush, roof crush, ISOFIX, and ejection mitigation. All test elements report compliance statuses as OK/NOK.

- **US NCAP Tests**: Include front crash (56kph RW impact), evaluating the Head Injury Criterion (HIC), Neck Injury Criterion (Nij), chest deflection, femur forces, and various metrics associated with tibia and foot displacement. EV-specific criteria assess electrolyte spillage, insolation resistance, and battery temperature management post-crash.

- **IIHS Crash Rating**: Evaluations for frontal overlap impacts on left and right sides and side crash barriers determine head injury and body impact metrics, tibia index, and intrusion tolerances.

- **Static Roof Test**: Requires structures to sustain loads exceeding 4 times curb weight with minimal displacement (<127mm). Calculations include plate load values.

- **Rollover Tests**: Encompass dynamic maneuvers (fishhook) and static vehicle rotations across all axes from 0º to 360º within designated durations, while monitoring spillage and structural integrity.

- **EV-specific Criteria**: Add tests for electrolyte spillage (≤5 liters), resistance insulation (>500 Ohm/V), and battery cooling during post-crash monitoring (<25.5ºC over 6 hours).

- **Side Crash Metrics**: Include movable deformable barriers and rigid poles impacting different occupant types. Evaluations focus on rib deflections, pelvic forces, and abdominal impact forces rated under stringent thresholds.

- **Whiplash Protection**: Specific assessments for time-to-head-restraint contact (<70ms), acceleration thresholds (<9.5g), and associated neck force classification.

Testing validation aligns with VTS Ver.06 standards.
