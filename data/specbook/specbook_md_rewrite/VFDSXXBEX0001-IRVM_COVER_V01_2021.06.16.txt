AAR is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is described in the standard VFDST00038401, which outlines the requirements for the quantity of parts and timing. 

At each step of the process, the Supplier is responsible for submitting parts to VF Quality Design as per the agreed timeline in order to obtain OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval. The process initiates in the early phases of the PT build to ensure AAR Approval at LS.

The Supplier must incorporate this activity into their development process and allocate costs to ED&D.

6 Supplier responsibilities.

The supplier is responsible to provide and ensure certain deliverables while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk associated with the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements.**

**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup.**  
The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle.**  
The support period of after-sales spare parts shall not be shorter than ten years after VinFast starts production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts.**  
The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VinFast’s after-sales engineering department with information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS. This includes items such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters (e.g., installation clearance, parts performance parameters).

7 Intellectual Property / Copyright.  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).  

If the supplier proposes using their existing parts, components, or designs, it must be ensured that there will be no intellectual property infringement. The supplier must submit relevant documents and certificates in this regard.

The supplier must notify VinFast if, at any stage, they believe there is a likelihood of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by the manufacture, importation, use, or sale of the part anywhere in the world.

8 Insurance / Warranties.  
Refer to VinFast General Term and Condition (GTC).

9 VinFast GTC & Part Packaging and Incoterms.
