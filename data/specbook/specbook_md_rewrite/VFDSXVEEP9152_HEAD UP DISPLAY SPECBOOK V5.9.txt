4 General Project Guidelines

4.1 Development Scope Abstract.

VinFast (VinFast Trading and Production Limited Liability Company) has started to design and develop a new D-segment vehicle in both BEV and ICE, identified by VF35 (ICE vehicle) and VF35e (BEV vehicle). This technical specification is a written summary of requirements to be taken into account in the development of the Head-Up Display.

The requirements described in this technical specification relate primarily to functional characteristics. The contractor ensures that the development of the components respects all applied standards, characteristics, and project requirements. Any possible cost savings as a result of improvements in design, production, or validation details must be reported immediately. The contractor is a ‘System Development Supplier’ with complete responsibility for the supplied system within the system boundaries.

4.2 Initial Situation and Objective.

The Windshield Head-Up Display (WHUD) is a module for displaying essential driver information on the windshield to help the driver look easily and naturally. The HUD connects to the INFO CAN, which is a high-speed CAN connection.

The HUD is planned to become platform parts to use in further various vehicle models of VinFast, for various country-specific packages, and for various combinations of optional equipment. The adaptation of system functions to a given vehicle shall be accomplished by modular component population of the necessary modules and coding via the diagnostics interface.

The design of the HUD shall avoid noise generation like squeak and rattle as well as noise generation due to moving parts. Furthermore, the electronics shall be designed to work without a fan or external cooling under the required temperature conditions.

To reach an effective night design, it is obligatory that the background dimming of all scales, the display, and the warning lights is homogeneous, and the brightness can be aligned to each other.

To achieve a visible and acceptable contrast ratio (CR) of the visual display content during night time and under different background light brightness conditions of the front road, the HUD shall have auto-dimming functionality based on input light raw values from RLS.

#### 7.2 Block and Principle Diagram  

##### 7.2.1 Elements of Systems  
The Head-Up Display (HUD) is designed to project vehicle computer information onto the windshield or a transparent plastic screen in front of the driver. This feature provides a safer driving experience, particularly at high speeds or during night driving. The HUD displays essential information such as:  
- Vehicle speed.  
- Warning signals.  
- Navigation indicator arrows.  

This allows the driver to focus on driving without needing to look down at the instrument cluster or secondary display.  

A typical HUD consists of three primary components:  
1. **Picture Generating Unit (PGU)**  
2. **Projector Unit**  
3. **Combiner**  

- **Projection Unit**: This unit utilizes an optical collimator setup, consisting of a convex lens or concave mirror paired with display technologies such as Cathode Ray Tube, light-emitting diode, or liquid crystal display. The setup produces images perceived as being at infinity, aiding driver focus.  

- **Combiner and Mirrors**: The HUD incorporates a specialized optical structure with two concave mirrors. These mirrors reflect visible light while allowing infrared radiation transmission. Positioned at a 45° angle of incidence, this configuration minimizes the temperature strain caused by light sources through heat-light separation, which is essential given the proximity of the light source to the mirrors.

### Functional Responsibility

#### HUD Setting - Brightness and Auto-Dimming

**General Description**  
The HUD supports brightness level adjustment of the Virtual Image (VI) via MHU, along with an auto-dimming functionality. The auto-dimming function adjusts VI brightness automatically based on the user-set brightness level and the HUD RLS sensor’s detected brightness of the front road.

Additionally, the HUD auto-dimming function allows delay coding (`HUD_DimmingDelayTime`) at EOL via Diagnostic Command. Calibration for auto-dimming is performed with the HUD supplier, ensuring a designed Contrast Ratio for optimal legibility.

**Input Parameters**  
- **Tx/Rx**: `0x40A`, `MHU_HudSetting`, `MHU_SET_UserBrightnessLvl`  
  - Values: `0` ("No action"), `1` to `21` ("Level 1" to "Level 21"), followed by reserved values from `22` to `31`.  
  - Send Method: `OnWriteWithRepetition`  
- **Tx/Rx**: `0x445`, `BCM_RainLightSnr`, `RS_HUD_illuminance`  
  - Values: `n.a.`  
  - Send Method: `Cyclic`

- **Tx/Rx**: Various inputs for headlight statuses.  
  - Signals: `LDML_LIGHT`, `LDMR_LIGHT`, `BCM_LIGHT` indicating high/low beam states (`ON`, `OFF`, `Fault`, `Signal Invalid`).  

**Output Parameters**  
- **Tx/Rx**: `0x41E`, `HUD_State`, `HUD_UserSetBrightnessLvl`  
  - Values: `0` to `21` representing brightness levels, reserve values from `22` onwards.  
  - Send Method: `Cyclic`  

**Functional Description**  
The HUD brightness adjustment involves 21 levels set by user manipulation of the slider bar. Signals (`MHU_SET_UserBrightnessLvl`) are transmitted from MHU to HUD, which responds with feedback signals. Front road light brightness values are sent via signals (`RS_HUD_illuminance` from Rain-Light Sensor -> BCM -> XGW -> HUD).  
Brightness adapts based on ambient light to ensure visibility (e.g., day/night conditions determined by headlight signals).  
- VF8 detects conditions using `BCM_LowBeamSts` and `BCM_HighBeamSts`.  
- VF9 detects conditions using multiple signals: `LDML_LowBeamSts`, `LDML_HighBeamSts`, `LDMR_LowBeamSts`, `LDMR_HighBeamSts`.  

If Rain-Light Sensor error occurs (`RS_F_HUD_Sensor == 1`), brightness defaults to ensure driver visibility.

#### Functional Description
The vehicle shall provide functionality for the driver to enter Position Edit mode using the MHU for altering the height and rotation of the VI through the Multi-function Switch (MFS) on the steering wheel.

- The MHU shall send a signal, **MHU_SET_HudWorkingMode**, to initiate or exit Position Edit mode for the HUD.  
- The HUD shall provide feedback via the **HUD_WorkingMode** signal.  

In production samples, the values for **EOL Mode** (value = 2) and **Engineering Mode** (value = 3) in the **MHU_SET_HudWorkingMode** signal shall be ignored by the HUD.
Page 33
When the user presses the 'Edit Position' button on the MHU, the HUD shall exit the normal display mode and enter the 'position adjustment mode'. The user can adjust the Height of VI by short press of the Up and Down buttons of the MFS, and adjust the Rotation Angle by short press of the Left and Right buttons of the MFS. A short press of the OK button will confirm the setting.

The HUD shall support 21 steps of Height adjustment, from level 1 to level 21. It shall support 15 steps of Rotation adjustment, from level 1 to level 15.

If the HUD is in Position Adjustment Mode with no adjustment from the driver for a timeout period of 15 seconds, it shall exit this mode and revert back to Working Mode. The timeout parameter (HUD_SettingTimeOut) can be configured via CDS at VinFast EOL.

The settings for height and rotation shall be saved in the MHU user profile. When the driver changes profiles, the MHU shall restore the profile's position by sending signals `MHU_SET_HudRotateLvl` and `MHU_SET_HudHeightLvl`. Refer to the function titled "Restore HUD setting by User profile."

The HUD shall adhere to the latest HUD HMI specifications.

If `VCU_ACTGear == 7` "Fault", R/N/D will flash at 1.25Hz with a 50% duty cycle, using the current gear icon before the value changes to 7 "Fault".  
- For P Gear, a larger icon will be displayed, replacing the Speedometer and matching its size. P Gear remains constantly displayed with no timeout limit, as illustrated in the right image.  

Refer to the latest HUD HMI specification for detailed definitions.

**7.3.3.8.5 Failsafe Behavior**  
If the signal times out in 3 seconds, gear information is invalid (`VCU_ACTGearValid == 1 "Invalid"`) or  
`VCU_ACTGear == 7 "Fault"`, HUD will display the Gear Info icon "—" continuously, matching the current gear icon's size and position until a valid signal is received.  

Signal cyclic rate is 40ms, with a timeout set to 400ms in the DBC.

  **Signal Name:** MHU_MessageNumber  
  **Values:** n.a  
  **Send Method:** OnWrite  

- **CAN ID:** 0x3AF  
  **CAN Name:** MHU_HUD_BASE  
  **Signal Name:** MHU_UTF8Character_Byte1 through Byte6  
  **Values:** n.a  
  **Send Method:** OnWrite  

#### Output Parameters
No output parameters.

#### Functional Description
HUD shall display only incoming call information, not display outgoing call.  
HUD shall receive signals **MHU_TELStatus**, **MHU_MUTEStatus**, and **MHU_TEL_source** from MHU initially to determine incoming call events, telephone source, and mute/unmute status.
Page 44
### 7.3.3.11.4 Functional Description
HUD shall receive call information (phone name/phone number) by multiple message MHU_HUD_BASE, each message contains 6 UTF8 bytes: 
- **MHU_UTF8Character_Byte1** 
- **MHU_UTF8Character_Byte2** 
- **MHU_UTF8Character_Byte3** 
- **MHU_UTF8Character_Byte4** 
- **MHU_UTF8Character_Byte5** 
- **MHU_UTF8Character_Byte6**

HUD shall check the signal **MHU_TotalMessages** to know the total number of CAN messages contained in **MHU_HUD_BASE**, with each message being counted by the signal **MHU_MessageNumber**.

The caller name/phone number shall be divided by sending "ETX" (End of text, Unicode value 0x03). The unused byte, if present, shall be filled with `0xFF`.

#### Example Calculation for Incoming Call Data Transmission
- If the call information is encoded into 18 bytes UTF8, **MHU** shall send `18/6 = 3` CAN messages **MHU_HUD_BASE**, with no unused bytes.  
- If the call information contains only 15 bytes UTF8, **MHU** will still send `ROUNDUP(15/6) = 3` CAN messages to deliver 15 bytes UTF8. The remaining 3 unused bytes will be filled with `0xFF`.

#### Logic for Handling Lost Messages
HUD shall identify if CAN messages are lost based on the following conditions:
1. The signal **MHU_MessageNumber** increases non-continuously (e.g., sequence skips: `1, 3, 4, 5, 8`).  
2. The total message count **MHU_HUD_BASE** does not equal the value of signal **MHU_TotalMessages**.

If **MHU_HUD_BASE** messages are lost:
- HUD will not display the incoming call information due to incomplete data.
  
If HUD receives all **MHU_HUD_BASE** messages:
- HUD will concatenate multiple UTF8 bytes into a UTF8 string and display the information on the Virtual Image (VI).

#### Incoming Call Protocol Diagram Description
The diagram illustrates the flow of incoming call information:
- **Step 1:** Incoming call is received via **MHU_HUD_BASE** messages.  
- **Step 2:** Each message contains 6 UTF8 bytes, and "ETX" is used to separate caller name/phone number.  
- **Step 3:** Concatenated UTF8 data is processed and displayed on the HUD.

#### Data Loss Handling Example
If HUD identifies irregularities such as skipped message numbers (`1, 3, 4, 5, 8`) or mismatched total messages:
- HUD will not display the incoming call, ensuring data reliability.

Refer to the provided diagram for a detailed breakdown of the byte encoding process and incoming call protocol validation.
Page 45
The display of incoming calls shall follow the HMI/UI specification.

7.3.3.13.4 Functional Description. The HUD shall display turn-by-turn (TBT) navigation information if navigation is enabled in the MHU setting. The display of navigation information on the HUD shall be synchronized with navigation information on the MHU (Head Unit). HUD shall show TBT navigation if MHU_Nav_State != Disable. 

The detail of navigation information and the layout shall follow the latest HMI/Styling Specification. HUD shall support different navigation sources such as Native map (embedded map), Google Map, and Apple Map, as indicated by signal MHU_NavSource. MHU shall read the distance to the next turn value and unit from the Map Engine, convert it to a string, and send it to the HUD via one or multiple messages from MHU_NAV_GuidanceDist.

Each message MHU_NAV_GuidanceDist can carry six UTF8 bytes by signals MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte1, MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte2, MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte3, MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte4, MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte5, and MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte6. HUD shall combine all UTF8 bytes and convert them into the string describing the distance to the next turn and the unit, then display it on the HUD. Unused characters shall be set as value EXT with a value of 0x03. If MHU sends MHU_NavDist_TotalMsg == 0, HUD shall hide the distance to the next turn.

Figure 1511: Sending distance to the next turn as a string. This figure visualizes the process of reading the distance data from the Map Engine and constructing the HUD display for navigation.

MHU shall read the short guidance text from the map engine and send it to the HUD via multiple messages using MHU_HUD_NAV_GuidanceCont. Each message can encode six UTF8 bytes. Unused characters will be encoded as “EXT” with a Unicode value of 0x03. HUD shall combine multiple messages and recover the combined guidance string to display on the HUD.

HUD shall display the distance to the short guidance text below the TBT icon, following HMI/UI Specification. If MHU_HUD_NAV_GuidanceCont::MHU_NavGuidance_TotalMsg == 0, HUD shall hide the short guidance text.

Figure 1611: Sending distance to the next turn and short guidance text. This figure illustrates how the data on guidance text and distance is transmitted to and processed by the HUD.

HUD shall follow the same rules as in the function "Display incoming call information" to receive text from MHU. If MHU_NavSource == 0x0 "Here Map (Default embedded map)", MHU_NavSource == 0x3 "Google Map", or MHU_NavSource == 0x2 "Apple Map", HUD shall display Turn-by-Turn icons corresponding to the value of the MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon signal as described below:

7.3.3.13.4 Functional Description. 
The HUD shall display turn-by-turn (TBT) navigation information if Navigation is enabled in the MHU setting. The display of navigation information on HUD shall be synchronized with navigation information on MHU (Head Unit).

HUD shall display TBT navigation if MHU_Nav_State != Disable. The detailed navigation information and layout shall follow the latest HMI/Styling Specification.

HUD shall support different navigation sources such as Native map (embedded map), Google map, and Apple map as indicated by the signal MHU_NavSource.

MHU shall read the distance to the next turn value and unit from the map engine, convert the result to a string, and transmit it to HUD via one or multiple MHU_NAV_GuidanceDist messages. Each MHU_NAV_GuidanceDist message contains six UTF8 bytes specified by the signals:  
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte1
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte2
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte3
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte4
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte5
- MHU_NavDist_UTF8_Byte6  

HUD combines all transmitted UTF8 bytes into a string to display the distance to the next turn and its unit on the HUD. Any unused characters are encoded as "EXT" with a value of 0x03. If MHU sends MHU_NavDist_TotalMsg == 0, HUD shall hide the distance to the next turn.

**Figure 1511: Sending Distance to the Next Turn as a String.**  
The figure illustrates how map engine data is transformed into a protocol and transmitted to HUD using encoded bytes.

MHU shall read short guidance from the map engine and send it to HUD via multiple MHU_HUD_NAV_GuidanceCont messages. Each message encodes six UTF8 bytes, and unused characters shall be encoded as "EXT" with unicode value 0x03.

HUD shall combine these messages into a string and display the short guidance text below the turn-by-turn icon according to the HMI/UI Specification. If the signal MHU_HUD_NAV_GuidanceCont::MHU_NavGuidance_TotalMsg == 0, HUD shall hide the short guidance text.

**Figure 1611: Sending Short Guidance.**  
The figure provides an example of sending short guidance text to HUD, demonstrating how multiple messages are encoded and sent.

HUD shall follow the existing rules used in the "Display incoming call information" function to handle received text messages from MHU.

If the MHU_NavSource signal indicates "Here Map (Default embedded map)" (0x0), "Google Map" (0x3), or "Apple Map" (0x2), HUD shall display Turn-by-Turn icons corresponding to the values of the signal MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon.

83. Roundabout enter and exit at the 19th street. HUD shall generate the roundabout icon dynamically with junction information.

If the map engine is Apple map, and MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon == 63 (Decimal), the HUD shall display the Turn icon as a dynamic signal intersection icon with additional junction information.

If MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon == 64 (Decimal) to 83, the HUD shall display the dynamic roundabout icon with additional junction information.

HUD shall determine right-hand side traffic and left-hand side traffic by signal MHU_DrivingSide. HUD shall generate the roundabout icon in an anti-clockwise direction (right-hand side traffic) and in a clockwise direction (left-hand side traffic).

- Roundabout for right-hand side traffic.
- Roundabout for left-hand side traffic.
Page 77
HUD shall support two kinds of roundabout: Roundabout without specific exit number and Roundabout with a specific exit number.

If HUD receives signal MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon == 64 (Dec), HUD displays the roundabout without an exit number.

If HUD receives signal MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon == 65 (Dec) to 83 (Dec), HUD displays the roundabout with an exit number in the center of the roundabout icon. For example, if MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon == 76 (dec), HUD will generate the roundabout with the exit at the 12th street as shown below:
- HUD shall display roundabout icon dynamically with junction information based on received signals.

HUD shall receive 1–3 NAV_JUNC_INFO messages. The graphic of dynamic single intersections (Apple map) and dynamic roundabouts shall be generated dynamically with junction information.

If HUD doesn’t receive NAV_JUNC_INFO messages, HUD shall display only the Turn-by-Turn icon without junction information.

At the first NAV_JUNC_INFO message (MHU_Junction_MsgNum == 1), signal MHU_JunctionElement0 is implied to be the exit junction.

If there are multiple junctions, MHU sends multiple NAV_JUNC_INFO messages as illustrated in the diagram. Each NAV_JUNC_INFO message encodes up to seven junctions. The system shall support up to 19 junctions in maximum.

**Figure 1713:** Junction information protocol.

There are 19 types of junctions (junction #1 to junction #19) supporting 21 angles. These junctions are drawn on the coordinate system as visually represented below.
Page 78
HUD shall support two kinds of roundabouts: roundabout without a specific exit number and roundabout with a specific exit number.

If HUD receives the signal `MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon == 64 (Dec)`, HUD will display the roundabout without an exit number.
If HUD receives the signal `MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon == 65 (Dec)` to `83 (Dec)`, HUD will display the roundabout with the exit number in the center of the roundabout icon. For example, when `MHU_Nav_TBT_Icon == 76 (Dec)`, HUD will generate the roundabout with the exit located at the 12th street.

HUD shall receive 1–3 messages `NAV_JUNC_INFO`, and the graphic for the dynamic single intersection (Apple map) and dynamic roundabout shall be generated dynamically with junction information. If HUD does not receive the `NAV_JUNC_INFO` message, HUD shall display only the turn-by-turn icon without junction information.

- At the first `NAV_JUNC_INFO` message (`MHU_Junction_MsgNum == 1`), the signal `MHU_JunctionElement0` implies the exit junction.
- If there are multiple junctions, `MHU` will send multiple messages `NAV_JUNC_INFO`. Each message `NAV_JUNC_INFO` supports encoding seven junctions. The system shall support up to 19 junctions in total.

7.3.3.15.3 Output parameters. Display Traffic sign board icon in the VI.

7.3.3.15.4 Functional Description. Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) is a driver assistance system that displays drivers the current speed limit and any other traffic signs on the road from which is possible to infer speed limit. Speed limits will also be inferred from ISA Maps. It will issue a warning when the driver crosses these speed limits. The system might also detect and display non-speed related relevant traffic signs to the user.

If TSR is ON (ADAS_TSR_Mode_Feed == 1 "ON"), HUD shall receive the TSR signals and display the recognized traffic sign indicator accordingly.

If ADAS_TSR_Mode_Feed == 0 "Off", HUD shall hide Traffic sign in HUD VI.

If ADAS_TSR_Mode_Feed == 2 or 3, HUD shall ignore and keep the latest state.

The HUD shall support display only speed limit traffic sign (Type 1: General maximum speed limit sign).

HUD shall display the Traffic sign Icon which is contained in HMI/UI specification.

HUD shall display Traffic signal corresponding to the target market.

HUD shall receive the signal ADAS_TSR_Typ1 and signal ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value from ADAS ECU to display the Type 1 ICON as below definition:
- Icon Display: Speed value ADAS_TSR_Typ1. Icon Definition: [Details provided in the table/form specifications].
Page 87
If no speed limit sign is detected, the display shall show "No detected." This applies to speed limit signs in Vietnam (VN), European Union (EU), the United States (US), and Canada. 

When a speed limit is detected, ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value will display the icon "Speed limit" with the detected value. This function supports displaying speed limits for VN, EU, US, and Canada. 

If the end of the speed limit is detected, ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value will display the "End of the speed limit" icon. The detection applies to VN and EU traffic signs or US signs.

In Vietnam SOP (CAN DBC v9.2.x), the HUD will calculate and display the speed limit value as ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value minus 5 units. In Global SOP software, the HUD will directly display ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value without adjustments.

A flashing Type 1 traffic sign icon will appear at 1.25 Hz frequency with a 50% duty cycle when ADAS_TSR_Typ1_Flashing_Warning is set to "ON." If ADAS_TSR_Typ1 indicates "Maximum Speed Limit" or "End of speed limit sign" but ADAS_TSR_Typ1_value equals 0, the HUD will hide the Type 1 icon.

The HUD shall fetch sales country information from the Vehicle Onboard Diagnostics (VOD) written by End-of-Line (EOL) systems to display accurate TSR icons. If the sales country data is not implemented, the HUD will use the signal MHU_STAT_DetectedCountry for country encoding based on ISO 3166-1 numeric identifiers.

The default country is EU if MHU_STAT_DetectedCountry equals 0 or 1023.

### Table: Country Encoding and Default Settings
| ID  | Country      | MHU_STAT_DetectedCountry |
|-----|--------------|--------------------------|
| 1   | Viet Nam     | 704                      |

### 7.3.3.20.4 Functional Description
Forward Collision Warning (FCW) is a driver assistance system that warns drivers when an imminent collision is expected at the front of the vehicle with objects, including vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles, or motorcycles, potentially on the ego-vehicle’s driving path.

The display of this feature shall comply with the latest HMI/Styling Specification. MHU shall determine the state of the FCW function using the signals: ADAS_FCW_state, ADAS_FCW_warning, and ADAS_FCW_check. FCW operates according to the defined state diagram.

#### Signal Control Conditions:
- If `ADAS_FCW_state != 2 "Active state"`, HUD shall not display FCW warnings in VI.
- If `ADAS_FCW_state == 2 "Active state"`, HUD shall display FCW warnings in VI.

HUD shall display three levels of FCW warning and the corresponding chime based on the following:

**Warning Levels:**
| **Pop-up Description** | **Signal Check Condition**              | **Definition**                                | **Chime/Sound**                              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| No display             | `ADAS_FCW_warning == 0 "No Warning"`   | Precondition not satisfied/activation not allowed (not active). | None |
| Refer HMI/UI spec       | `ADAS_FCW_warning == 1 "Warning stage-1"` | FCW Warning Stage-1.                          | Warning Lv1 |

### Visual State Representation
The FCW HMI State Flow diagram indicates the operational states. States include:
- **OFF**: No feedback. System deactivated.
- **Standby**: No feedback. Transitional mode based on speed and wiper conditions.
- **Active**: Armed or warning stages activated based on driving conditions.

HUD displays escalating stages based on system feedback. Warnings are visually indicated on VI, with chime alerts corresponding to severity.

7.3.3.20.4 Functional Description.  
Forward Collision Warning (FCW) is a driver assistance system that warns drivers when an imminent collision is expected at the front of the vehicle with objects (vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcycles) potentially intervening with the ego-vehicle’s current driving path.  
The display of this feature shall be defined by the latest HMI/Styling Specification.  
MHU shall determine the state of FCW function by signal ADAS_FCW_state, ADAS_FCW_warning, and ADAS_FCW_check. FCW shall operate by the following states:  

If ADAS_FCW_state != 2 "Active state," HUD shall not display FCW warning in VI. Otherwise, HUD shall display FCW warning HNI in VI.  
HUD shall display three levels of FCW warning and the warning chime according to the below definition:  
- **No display**: ADAS_FCW_warning == 0 "No Warning." Precondition not satisfied/activation not allowed (not active). No chime/sound.  
- **FCW Warning stage-1**: ADAS_FCW_warning == 1 "warning stage-1." Warning Level 1.  
- **FCW Warning stage-2**: ADAS_FCW_warning == 2 "warning stage-2." Warning Level 2.  
- **FCW Warning stage-3**: ADAS_FCW_warning == 3 "warning stage-3." Warning Level 3.  

Figure 1915 illustrates the FCW HMI State flow. The system transitions between Off, Standby, and Active states based on conditions such as speed, gear shift, and wiper speed. System malfunction or faults are indicated by IPC notifications.

7.15 Resistance to Media and Chemical Requirements.

7.15.1 Contamination.  
Must follow VF standard.  

7.15.2 Cleaning.  
Must follow VF standard.  

7.15.3 Corrosion Protection.  
Generally:  
For determination of corrosion requirements the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:
1. **Corrosivity Low**: Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
2. **Corrosivity Medium**: Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.
3. **High corrosivity**: Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.
4. **Very high corrosivity**: Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

Electrically functional units in casings and boxes with enclosed air volumes, such as different types of control units, shall be ventilated via a moisture/wetness resistant membrane (type Goretex), when in wet locations.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes also fasteners and attached brackets.  
Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners etc., that are long-term corrosion resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.  

**Terminals, connectors**: Don’t place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is first of all a requirement for tightness – electrical connections must be protected from humidity.  
**Groundings**: Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight, if placed in a corrosive environment.  
**Aluminium/sealing surfaces**: Aluminium alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Reason: Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.

**Corrosion tests**:  
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.  
Before and after corrosion testing, a functional testing is to be carried out:  
- Component test for metallic surfaces: Salt spray test (ISO9227), acceptance criteria see below.  
- For organic coatings: Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria see below.
Page 119
Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

**Test criteria:**

**Area:**  
Interior, mounted parts, dry area.  
**Corrosivity:**  
Low.  
**Metallic coatings:**  
240 h NSS à ISO 9227.  
**Organic coatings:**  
96 h à ISO 6270 CH.  
**Pass criteria:**  
No red rust.

**Pass criteria for organic coatings after CCT:**  
- Rust creep according to ISO 4628-8: galvanized steel, d = 4 mm.  
- Steel and aluminum sheet, d = 1 - 2 mm.  
- Blistering: Blister size max. S2 (Assessment according to DIN EN ISO 4628-2).  
- Edge corrosion: ≤ 10%.  
- Weld seam corrosion: ≤ 5%.  
- Degree of rusting according to ISO 4628-3: Ri 1.

**Steel structural components (brackets, etc.):**  
- Metallic surfaces: Neutral Salt spray test (NSS) ISO 9227 according to corrosivity level.  
- Organic coatings: Cyclic corrosion test ISO 11997-1 cycle B according to corrosivity level.  
**Pass criteria:**  
No red rust; slight corrosion on edges and threads acceptable. Further details according to the table above.

**Aluminum components:**  
- **Aluminum painted:** See requirements and criteria for painted steel.  
- **Aluminum anodized:** Component test 240 h ISO9227 NSS.  
**Pass criteria:**  
No visible changes.  
**Position:**  
Position of the anodized parts in the test chamber shall always be as in the vehicle.  
**Rubber connection testing:**  
Anodized aluminum parts that are connected to rubber parts shall be tested together with them as in the vehicle.

**Pass criteria for functional units in casings and boxes:**  
- The specimen has to be tested in a similar position as installed in the vehicle. Connections should be installed as original.  
- No base metal corrosion along sealing planes; Exemption: Rust extension max. 2 mm from steel edges.  
- No surface changes inside the housing.  
- No functional limitation.

- The conformance to prohibited substances must be ensured by the supplier throughout the complete product life cycle.  
- For PPAP material data sheets (MDS) in IMDS according to IMDS Rules and Guidelines IMDS 001 and IMDS Recommendations 002 - 022 are required. Updates are required for changes.  

Material data sheets have to be provided by the supplier to VinFast:  
**Project VinFast IMDS-ID**: **214435**.  
All materials and components must meet the latest legal requirements of the UN regulations regarding restricted and prohibited materials and substances for automotive applications. At least all materials and substances used for automotive products must meet the Global Automotive Declarable Substances List (GADSL).  
Further information: [GADSL Guidelines](https://www.gadsl.org/)  

##### Recycled Materials
- When selecting materials, attention must focus on reducing the variety of materials and ensuring compatibility with available recycling procedures ("proven recycling technologies").  
- Secondary raw materials (e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics) must be preferred based on market availability.  
- Recycled materials must be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and reported to environmental compliance experts at VinFast.  

#### 7.16.2 End-of-Life Treatment
##### Dismantling Scheme
The dismantling scheme describes the requirements to the contractor in terms of simple, unmixed dismantling of the component and its accessibility when assembled.  
The dismantling scheme must be provided to environmental experts at VinFast before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.  

##### Recycling Scheme
This chapter establishes general project-wide requirements for developing a component's recycling and repair scheme.
Page 122
7.16.2 Recycling Scheme Requirements.

Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at the end of life. The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation. 

Recycling scheme must be submitted to the environmental experts team at VINFAST before the PTO (Production Try-Out) milestone. 

### Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization.

To ensure cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, the following requirements must be met for pyrotechnic initiators:

- Enable sequential deployment of all components to avoid noise/pressure peaks and check deployment per component.
- Post-deployment, no solid combustion residues should remain. Any remaining residues must not be classified as hazardous or toxic waste per applicable legislation (otherwise, these components shall be dismantled and disposed of separately).
- Successful deployment of pyrotechnic components must be immediately and clearly visible (audibly and visually at the vehicle or through feedback on the deployment tool).
- Marking of positions for pyrotechnic components is required, especially for hidden components like battery safety terminals or active safety headrests.
- Non-deployed pyrotechnic components must be removable without requiring pre-dismantling when technically possible.

---

### 7.16.3 Eco-Design.

#### Parts Marking.
Parts marking should follow the principle of "as few characters as possible but as many as necessary." Markings must adhere to DIN, EN, or ISO standards (with ISO taking precedence). Codes should be enclosed in arrowed brackets (“>” and “<”).

#### 7.16.4 Lifecycle Analysis.
Details for this section are TBD.

---

### 7.16.5 Emissions and Toxicology.

#### Harmful Substances in Components and Materials.
The emission behavior of E/E products directly contacting the interior compartment must be verified on representative components as early as possible. Specific requirements include:

- Volatile organic compound emissions in the passenger compartment must be minimized.
- Emissions confirmation testing must be conducted by suppliers at approved institutions authorized by VINFAST.
- Testing should follow VINFAST-approved guidelines and align with additional project-specific requirements, such as the Emission Guideline.

It is advised for suppliers to acquire information about VINFAST-approved testing institutions to ensure compliance.
Page 123
Volatile organic compounds of components have to be checked according to ISO12219. The conformance to prohibited substances has to be ensured through the complete product life cycle. The test result is evaluated by the specialist department of VINFAST. In any case, the harmlessness of the volatile compounds for human health has to be attested in written form on demand. The supplier has to provide measurement results regarding VOC and Fogging for the materials before the milestone purchase release.

### 7.17 Mechanical Requirements

#### 7.17.1 Load

**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the selected benchmark vehicles on tracks defined by VINFAST. The definition of the customer usage is based on the Vinfast standard for the long-distance durability run. The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car as specified in chapter 5.18.

**Special events:**  
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g. ABS-braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur and the intended service life will not be reduced.

**Misuse events:**  
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g. curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned that:  
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g. steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.)  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g. easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations, either to the same or at neighboring components (principle "deformation before break").

#### 7.17.2 Vibration Behavior
**NVH/Acoustics - Vibration Behavior:**  
The maximum vibration level is to be defined by the supplier (brackets must be developed to avoid resonances below a certain frequency).  
The supplier has to align the fixation concept with VINFAST. Additional structural dynamics requirements may be specified in chapter 5.17.6 if necessary.

#### 7.17.3 Stiffness and Cushioning Characteristics
TBD.
Page 124
7.17.4 Deformation  
TBD  

7.17.5 Pressure  
TBD  

7.17.6 NVH / Acoustic Performance.  
Noises which are perceived by the customers as disturbing must be ruled out through the selection of suitable materials, surfaces, gaps, and forming. The supplier must guarantee that the components are free of disturbing noise in their vehicle environment and geometrical integration. Similarly, at vehicle- and audio system excitation under all environmental conditions and over the fixed component service life, there must not be squeak and rattle noise due to excitation of the body (e.g., wind load, torsional flexing). This is required even if there are real relative movements on the surface.  

This requirement must be guaranteed over the whole operating and environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity. The supplier must coordinate the disturbing noise freedom requirements with the responsible testing team.  

The supplier is responsible for supporting the development of vibration and acoustic behavior of the subsystem within the complete vehicle environment. They must ensure constant acoustic quality of delivered parts. This includes actively supporting problem identification and proposing solutions. The supplier is also responsible for providing parts for comparison, tuning, and evaluation, as requested, free of charge.  

7.18 Durability / Life Time.  
The lifetime mileage of the complete vehicle shall be at least 160,000 km, and the vehicle lifetime shall be at least 10 years.
