3. Additional Technical or Functional Descriptions.

For BEV vehicles, cooling hoses and pipes provide coolant flow (YA-992 is a mixture of ethylene glycol, unique inhibitors such as organic acid salts and tolyltriazole, and water, consisting of approximately 93.3% ethylene glycol, 3.9% inhibitors, and 2.8% water) for DCDC, EDS (Electric Drive System), OBC (On Board Charger), and battery. The function of coolant hoses and pipes in a vehicle is to provide a flexible connection between moving components (e-motor) and fixed connections in the car, including the radiator, expansion tank, and pumps. The lines allow coolant flow at high temperatures while maintaining flexibility to absorb movements of the e-motor without ruptures, transmitting loads, or causing significant flow restrictions. These lines are shaped and sized based on system requirements.

The cooling lines distribute coolant between various components in the cooling and heating systems of the vehicle. It circulates coolant within the system, enduring continuous pressure and temperature fluctuations. Functional requirements for coolant hoses are as follows:

- The hoses shall be secured to the connections with POPP-clamp (Pre Open Pre Position) clamps or quick connectors.
- Cooling lines must operate efficiently in stressful environments with heat, pressure/vacuum, and blow-by gases — conditions that induce rapid heat aging in plastic and rubber materials.
- Flexible connections are required to isolate e-motor vibration and noise from the ducting system. Connections should be configured to prevent early failure or excess forces on turbochargers and air inlet components while allowing maximum allowable offset and compression.
- Certain hoses shall accommodate movement between e-motor and other components in the cooling system. Cooling lines must remain flexible to withstand e-motor rolling conditions.
- Cooling lines must be cleaned of debris. Hose material should prevent loose debris during prolonged operation. The outside of the hose should be cleaned with available washing agents.
- Hoses should have Fluorosilicone coating on the interior surface, providing strong resistance against oil and coolant, and ensuring protection against deterioration.
- Quick connectors mounted on cooling lines should be readily available as complete hose assemblies at car service stations or, when necessary, repairable or replaceable with the highest degree of accuracy and care.

**Temperatures and Pressures.**

The coolant temperature in BEV E-drive and heating loops may range between -30°C and 95°C. Ambient air temperature may range between -40°C and 105°C. Normal operating temperature is below 90°C. During soak, ambient temperatures may reach up to 105°C and coolant temperatures up to 90°C. Pressure variations may range from -10 kPa to 100 kPa overpressure.
