5.1.5.15 Environmental Compatibility.

The minimization of environmental impacts of a product through the complete life cycle is a key factor for future development of innovative products.

Additional Requirements:
The minimization of environmental impacts of a product requires:
- Minimization of consumption of resources.
- Strategy for waste prevention.
- Parts marking for identification at end of life.

The requirements of the following standards have to be met:
- Reuse, Recycling & Recoverability obligations for vehicles, components and parts according to UN Regulation No. 133.
- Parts marking for identification of materials at end of life of vehicles, components, and parts per ISO standards.
- Prohibition & restriction of substances according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including national chemical inventory 2017).
- Prohibition & restriction of substances per Global Automotive Declarable Substances List “GADSL.”

Material Information, Parts Marking & Substance Information:
- The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification must be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier.
  - The conformance to prohibited substances must be ensured by the supplier through the complete product life cycle.
  - For PPAP material data sheets (MDS) in IMDS according to IMDS Rules and Guidelines IMDS 001 and IMDS Recommendations 002-022 are required. Updates are required for changes.
- Material data sheets must be provided by the supplier to VINFAST under Project VINFAST IMDS-ID @ XXXX.

Parts marking should be carried out using the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations which have been defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). The codes are put into arrowed brackets, which consist of the mathematical signs for “more than” (>) and “less than” (<).

Material safety data sheets (SDS) according to Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including national chemical inventory 2017) must be provided for milestone concept confirmation. Consider local rules for SDS creation and UN-guidelines according to GHS Globally Harmonized System of Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Chemicals.

Recycling:

**Recycled materials:**  
When selecting materials, attention is to be focused on reducing the variety of materials and on compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  

**Recycling scheme:**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements on the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component.  
Design for recycling of parts and components is required in order to enable cost-effective recycling at the end-of-life.  
The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  

Recycling scheme has to be provided to the environmental experts’ team at VINFAST before milestone PTO Production Try-Out.
