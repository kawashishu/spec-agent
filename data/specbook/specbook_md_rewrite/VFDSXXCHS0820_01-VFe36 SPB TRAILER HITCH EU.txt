VF9 EU Ground Plane Data:

The diagram illustrates the mounting clearance requirements for the VF9 EU trailer hitch system. It specifies alignment points such as ground clearance, coupling point dimensions, and clearance space at vertical planes relative to vehicle limits. Key measurements include angular clearances, such as 45° and 65°, and linear distances like 140 mm minimum and 250 mm maximum. This detailed schematic ensures compliance with UNECE R55 standards.
