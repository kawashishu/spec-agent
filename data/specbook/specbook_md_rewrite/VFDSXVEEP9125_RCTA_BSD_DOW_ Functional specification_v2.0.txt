FS-226418  
Type:  
Information  
Status:  
New  

The Door Opening Warning (DOW) function alerts the driver about approaching objects when the vehicle door is open or about to be opened. The function is designed to mitigate potential hazards caused by objects approaching the vehicle from behind when passengers enter or exit the vehicle. The system uses sensors to monitor the surrounding area and provides a warning to the driver in cases of identified risks.

The DOW function relies on accurate sensor data but may encounter false or missed warnings due to sensor tolerances, transient input changes, or operation near boundary conditions.

8.4 / 4 Feature Overview

Requirement ID: FS-226415. Type: Information. Status: New.

The RCTA, LCW, and DOW functions are provided with corner SRR and ADCU. The system detects objects from the rear-left, rear-right, and back sides of the host vehicle. The system doesn't take automatic action to prevent collisions; the driver remains responsible for safe vehicle operation.

Note: Target accuracy tolerances of radar and transient input signal changes (speed, angle, etc.) may lead to false or missed warnings. Acceptance checks are based on the performance of SRR against test cases. This document serves as a reference.

Requirement ID: FS-226428  
Type: Functional  
Status: New  

8.6.1.1 / 6.1.1 General Description  

Requirement ID: FS-226429  
Type: Functional  
Status: New  

The RCTA Function assists the driver with optical and acoustical warnings to prevent collisions with rear traffic when backing out of parking spaces, by warning the driver for incoming target objects from the left, right, and center, relative to the back of the ego vehicle.  

The RCTA Function detects and predicts the path of the following target objects:  
- Cars  
- Motorcycles  
- Bicycles  
- Shopping carts  

The RCTA Function shall predict the path for all "target objects" and shall not generate false warnings for stationary "target objects." For instance, it shall not generate false warnings for stationary elements of the environment that are not other road users. Examples are light poles, garbage containers, etc.  

Considering whether the function is triggered or not is sensitive to the precise location of the target vehicle. The middle point of the object's front edge is defined as the reference point in the RCTA feature.
Page 14
Figure: Representing the Rear Traffic Alert Function.

The RCTA Function generates left-side or right-side warning according to left or right target object conditions. If target objects are coming from the back side, left and right-side warnings shall be generated at the same time. The back-side use case can be disabled via the dataset.
Page 15
Figure: representing the Rear Traffic Alert Function.  

The RCTA Function generates left or right-side warning according to left or right target objects' condition. If target objects are coming from the back side, left and right-side warnings shall be generated at the same time. The back side use case could be disabled via the dataset.

Figure: representing the RCTA 2 level “TTC Warning Zones” and “Front Extension Zone.”  

For the specific warning strategy, this RCTA function shall define a 2 Level “TTC Warning Zone” directly behind the ego vehicle and a front extension zone forward from the rear edge of the vehicle.
Page 16
For "TTC Warning Level_1 Zone", RCTA must define the width and rear length of this zone and also the minimum TTC of the tracked "target objects" using the following parameter values:
1. Target object TTC is between 2s and 2.5s.
2. The warning zone has a length of 3500mm < length ≤ 5000mm and width equal to the vehicle's width.

For "TTC Warning Level_2 Zone", RCTA must define the width and rear length of this zone and also the minimum TTC of the tracked "target objects" using the following parameter values:
1. Target object TTC minimum is ≤ 2s.
2. The warning zone length is between 0mm < length ≤ 3500mm, with a width equal to the vehicle's width.

For "Front Extension Zone", RCTA must define the width and length of this zone and also the minimum TTC of the tracked "target objects" using the following parameter values:
1. Target object TTC minimum is ≤ 2.5s.
2. The warning zone length dynamically changes between 1500mm and 3000mm, with the width equal to the vehicle's width.

RCTA warning will be generated when the extension of the object's speed direction intersects with the "Front Extension Zone" edge.

The Time to Collision (TTC) for a "target object" is calculated as:
1. "Target object" distance to the Critical Zone divided by "target object" closing speed.

The RCTA Function shall limit the relevant part of the "RTA Detection Zone" as follows:
1. Maximum range on the x-axis: 35 m.
2. Maximum range on the y-axis: from -90 to +90 degrees; typical 35m functional range decreases when angles exceed +/-90 degrees based on vehicle integration.

The RCTA Function shall define the minimum and maximum velocity of the tracked "target objects" using the following parameter values:
1. Target object minimum velocity: 1 m/s.
2. Target object maximum velocity: 30 m/s.

RCTA feature will generate warnings based on the location of the intersection of the object's velocity direction extension with the TTC warning zone:
1. If an object approaches from the left side, its velocity extension intersects the left edge of RCTA’s TTC warning zone, triggering a left-side warning.
Page 17
Figure: representing the RTA Zones and the scenario where objects are approaching from the left side. 

The scenario demonstrates how the RCTA Function defines its detection zones, including rear warning levels and a front extension zone. The detected object, located on the left side, intersects with the TTC Warning Zone, triggering a left warning. The visualization highlights the RTA Detection Zone parameters such as maximum range on the x-axis (35m), dynamic front extension zone length (1.5m to 3m), and rear length specifications. The left mirror LED flashes to provide an indication corresponding to the detected object's location and movement path.
Page 18
1. If the detected object is approaching from the right side, its velocity extension intersects with the right edge of the RCTA-defined TTC warning zone. The RCTA feature will trigger a right warning.

Figure: representing the RTA Zones and the scenario2 where objects are approaching from the right side.
This figure illustrates the RTA Detection Zone, TTC Warning Zones, and the object path extending to the intersection point triggering the right warning. The dynamic change of the front extension zone’s length is displayed (1.5m~3m), along with the RTA Detection Zone’s X-axis range of 35m and configurable width based on the vehicle dimensions. The warning light on the right mirror indicates the activation of the right-side warning.
Page 19
1. If the detected object is approaching from the rear side, its velocity extension intersects with the rear edge of the RCTA-defined TTC warning zone. In this case, the RCTA feature will trigger warnings on both sides.

Figure: representing the RTA Zones and the scenario3 where objects approach from the rear side.
Page 20
1. Once the object has entered the designed warning zone from one side, the alarm will last for a further 1 second before being terminated.

Figure: representing the warning duration for objects entering the designed warning zone.  
This illustration shows the sustained warning for 1 second after the front edge of an object enters the designated zone. The activated warning zone alerts based on the object’s position relative to the vehicle.
Page 21
1. Once the object has entered the designed warning zone from one side, the alarm will last for a further 1 second before being terminated.

Figure: representing the RTA Zones and the scenario3 that objects approaching from rear side.

The TTC for a target object is calculated as target object distance to the warning zone / target object closing speed.  
TTC can be simply accounted as distance in the velocity direction (from car to warning zone) divided by the velocity magnitude when the extension of the velocity direction intersects with the warning zone.  

The RCTA Function has a limited view in case a stationary object is present in the close vicinity of the sensors, as shown in the figure below.
Page 22
Figure: representing the RTA view limited by stationary object.

The figure illustrates an example where the RTA Function's view is restricted due to the presence of stationary objects near the sensors. This scenario demonstrates how stationary objects can obscure the detection range and impact the effectiveness of the warning mechanism. Object 1 creates a physical obstruction, while Object 2 represents a moving element whose path intersects with the TTC Warning Zone despite limitations in detection caused by Object 1.

8.6.2.1 / 6.2.1 General Description  

Requirement ID:  
FS-226432  
Type:  
Functional  
Status:  
New  

The LCW Function monitors the lanes next to the own vehicle and warns the driver if a lane change manoeuvre has the risk of a collision. The LCW Function is composed by the Blind Spot Warning (warns for objects the driver cannot see) and the Close Vehicle Warning (warns for objects that approach fast from behind).  

The LCW Function fulfils the requirements for a Type III "Lane Change Decision Aid System (LCDAS)", according to ISO 17387.  

The LCW Function detects the following target objects:  
- All big double-tracked vehicles: trucks, buses, vans.  
- All small double-tracked vehicles: passenger cars and passenger cars with trailer.  
- All powered two-wheelers: motorcycles, mopeds, scooters.  
- All non-powered two-wheelers: bicycles.  

The LCW Function will not generate warnings for stationary target objects or stationary elements of the environment.
Page 29
The LCW Function could generate two types of warnings to inform the driver of a possible collision:
• "Warning level 1" (standard warning)
• "Warning level 2" (critical warning)

**Figure: representing the Lane Change Warning Function.**

The LCW Function in accordance with ISO 17387 is classified as a Type III System and it comprises the Blind Spot Warning Function and the Closing Vehicle Warning. The LCW Function is implemented as a combination of the BSW Function and the CVW Function.

The LCW Function in accordance with ISO 17387 meets the Class C Requirements for the Closing Vehicle Warning.

**Figure: representing the ISO 17387 classification of a Lane Change Decision Aid System.**

Considering that whether the function is triggered or not is sensitive to the precise location of the target vehicle, the middle point of the object front edge is defined as the reference point in the LCW feature.

8.6.2.1.1 / 6.2.1.1 BSD.

Requirement ID: FS-226433.  
Type: Functional.  
Status: New.  

The BSD Function has a dynamic extendable back side of the Blind Spot Zone (BSZ) dependent on the Ego Vehicle's velocity.

The BSZ of the BSD system uses the following parameter values:  
- **The dynamic extension is started from 3.5m behind the rear bumper:**  
   - Blind spot zone extension in the x-direction: 3.5m.  
   - Warning zone extension in the y-direction (urban): 4.2m.  
   - Warning zone extension in the y-direction (interurban): 4.2m.  

- **Sensor will distinguish scenarios (urban/interurban) according to the Ego Vehicle's velocity:**  
   - When the velocity of the ego vehicle is greater than 70kph, the warning zone extension in the y-direction will use the parameter of the interurban mode.  
   - Otherwise, the parameter of the urban mode will be used.

Warning zones start on the x-axis: 0.5 m.  
Warning zones start on the y-axis: 0.3 m.  

Figure: representing the Geometric definitions for the BSZ.  

The BSD Function uses hysteresis in order to avoid the potential toggling of the warnings. This hysteresis is set as follows:  
- Hysteresis at the front (BszFrontHysteresis): 0.2 m.  
- Hysteresis at the rear (BszRearHysteresis): 1.0 m.  
- Hysteresis at the side (outer border) (BszSideHysteresis (Outer Border)): 0.6 m (must be the same as CVZ).  
- Hysteresis at the side (inner border) (BszSideHysteresis (Inner Border)): 0.2 m (must be the same as CVZ).

Requirement ID: FS-226433  
Type: Functional  
Status: New  

The BSD Function shall have a dynamic extendable back side of the Blind Spot Zone dependent on the Ego Vehicle's velocity.  

The BSD Function uses the following parameter values:  
- Warning zones start on the x-axis: 0.5 m.  
- Warning zones start on the y-axis: 0.3 m.

The BSD Function uses hysteresis to avoid potential toggling of the warnings. This hysteresis is set as follows:  
- Hysteresis at the front (BszFrontHysteresis): 0.2 m.  
- Hysteresis at the rear (BszRearHysteresis): 1.0 m.  
- Hysteresis at the side (outer border) (BszSideHysteresis (Outer Border)): 0.6 m (must be the same as CVZ).  
- Hysteresis at the side (inner border) (BszSideHysteresis (Inner Border)): 0.2 m (must be the same as CVZ).

Figure: representing the Geometric definitions for the BSZ.  

The BSW Function shall hold a warning in case of more than one "target object" overtaking the "ego vehicle". This avoids toggling warnings.  
- The designed minimum warning duration is 2s.  
- Warning shall be held if the second target's measured time to enter the Blind Spot Zone is below 1s.

Figure: representing the Hysteresis system for the BSZ.  

The BSD Function generates a warning for a target object if this target object is located inside of the BSZs (in accordance with ISO 17387). Otherwise, no warning will be generated.  

Figure: representing the platoon behavior of the system.
Page 33
The blind spot warning will be suppressed or triggered based on the relative velocity conditions of the target vehicle entering the adjacent zone from the front. The conditions are as follows:

- If the relative velocity of the target vehicle is greater than 3 m/s when it enters the warning zone, the warning will be suppressed until its velocity decreases to 2.5 m/s within the warning zone.
- If the relative velocity of the target vehicle is less than or equal to 3 m/s, the warning will be triggered immediately as the target enters the warning zone.
- If the relative velocity of the target vehicle increases to 6 m/s while in the warning zone, the warning will be suppressed.

### 8.6.2.1.2 / 6.2.1.2. Closing Vehicle Warning (CVW)

**Requirement ID:** FS-226434  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** New  

**Description:**  
The Closing Vehicle Warning (CVW) Function generates warnings for target objects based on their Time-to-Collision (TTC) values. The TTC is calculated as the distance from the bumper to the target vehicle divided by the relative velocity, using the formula:

`TTC = distance from bumper to target vehicle / relative velocity`

The CVW Function will generate warnings if the TTC of a target object is equal to or less than a certain threshold (typically defined as 3.5 seconds in projects and ISO 17387 Type III Class C). If the TTC exceeds this threshold, no warnings will be generated.

The dimensions of the Closing Vehicle Zone (CVZ) are based on adjacent lanes near the ego vehicle, independent of lane markings. Radar sensors do not detect lane markings; they are used only in diagrams for illustration.

**Parameter Values:**  

- The sensor adapts according to the ego vehicle's velocity to differentiate between urban and interurban scenarios.  

**Figures:**  
- A diagram illustrates how the CVW function operates with visual examples of the radar sensor detecting target vehicles.
Page 34
When the velocity of the ego vehicle is larger than 60kph, the warning zone extension in the y-direction will use the parameter of interurban mode; otherwise, it will use the parameter of urban mode.
- Warning zones start on the y-axis: 0.3 m (must be the same as BSZ).

**Figure:** Representing the geometric definitions of the CVZ.

The front side of the Closing Vehicle Zone (CVZ) corresponds to the back side of the Blind Spot Zone (BSZ). The back side of the CVZ corresponds to the detection limit of the Radar Sensor (approximately 90m, the maximum detection range of Hella 5G3 radar) and is therefore not configurable.

The CVW Function uses hysteresis to avoid potential toggling of the warnings. This hysteresis is configured as follows:
- Hysteresis at the side (outer border): 0.6 m (must be the same as BSZ).
- Hysteresis at the side (inner border): 0.2 m (must be the same as BSZ).

Requirement ID: FS-233040  
Type: Functional  
Status: New  

The DOW Function assists the passengers of the vehicle with optical (ambient light) and acoustical feedback to prevent a collision with an opened vehicle door from rear traffic. It informs all the passengers of incoming target objects from the left and right.  

The DOW Function detects and predicts the path of the following target objects:  
- Cars  
- Motorcycles  
- Bicycles  
- Shopping carts  

The DOW Function will not generate warnings for stationary target objects and elements of the environment.
Page 43
The DOW Function holds the warning as long as the target object fulfills the warning conditions (plus specific additional hold time).

Figure: Geometric definitions for 'EAF Detection Zone'.

The illustration demonstrates the geometric parameters and detection zone of the EAF system. It includes the maximum and minimum detection ranges along the X and Y axes for the rear left and right sensors. These geometric definitions clarify the placement and orientation of sensors relative to the vehicle's coordinate system (origin at the center of the front axle).

The following shall apply for the mounting positions of the left and right sensors:
- Rear Left Sensor Mounting Azimuth Angle.
- Rear Right Sensor Mounting Azimuth Angle.
- Rear Sensor Positions along X and Y axes.
- Rear Left Sensor Mounting Elevation Angle.
- Rear Right Sensor Mounting Elevation Angle.
- Rear Sensor Positions along Z axis.
Page 45
1. The x-positions are identical.  
2. The y-positions are symmetrical to the x-axis.  
3. The z-positions are identical.  

**NOTE:**  
The installation position of the system "EAF" in a specific vehicle influences the 'EAF Detection Zone' and as a result, the system performance in any case has therefore to be examined and discussed with Hella for each specific vehicle type.  

Considering that whether the function is triggered or not is sensitive to the precise location of the target vehicle, the closest corner point of the object is defined as the reference point in the EAF feature.  

**Figure:** The defined Reference point in EAF feature.

     - WidthTTC.  
   - TTC thresholds:
     - Vmin-out.

Page 48
Figure: representing the EAF warning zone.

The EAF Function shall generate a warning for "target objects" detected inside the "Immediate Warning Zone” and “TTC Warning Zone.”

The EAF Function shall limit the relevant part of the "EAF Detection Zone" on the x-axis and on the y-axis by using the following parameter values:
1. Maximum range on the x-axis: 40 m (begin from the rear bumper).
2. Maximum range on the y-axis ≤ 90° : 30 m (begin from the side edge of the ego vehicle).

The EAF Function shall define the minimum and maximum velocity of the tracked "target objects out of TTC" for which to generate a warning by using the following parameter values:
1. target object velocity min: 2.8 m/s.
2. target object velocity max: 30 m/s.

The EAF Function shall define the minimum and maximum velocity of the tracked "target objects in IWZ" for which to generate a warning by using the following parameter values:
1. target object velocity min: 1 m/s.
2. target object velocity max: 30 m/s.

The EAF Function shall define the minimum time to collision of the tracked "target objects" for which to generate a warning by using the parameter value:
1. target object TTC min: 2.5 s (default value).

The Time to Collision (TTC) for a “target object” is being calculated as:
1. TTC = distance from bumper to target vehicle DIV Relative Velocity.

For objects with an angle between the velocity direction of the object and the X-axis of the vehicle greater than 30°, the relevant warning should be suppressed. However, warnings will not be affected by the 30° angle suppression when objects are in the TTC zone.
Page 49
The DOW Function generates a warning with the tracked object that has an intersection point with the TTC warning zone and whose TTC is within 2.5s. The TTC for a target object is calculated as distance from bumper to target vehicle divided by relative velocity.

The DOW Function monitors vehicle door ajar and driver door lock status and could generate a door lock request along with two levels of warnings (the system will send these warnings but only if VF9 door is locked):
- **Level 1 Warning:** Standard optical warning that generates a door lock request if the driver door status is unlocked and the preceding warning state is no warning.
- **Level 2 Warning:** Critical optical and audible warning triggered when the door is ajar or the driver door lock action is detected during Level 1 Warning. In the latter case, the level 2 warning will last for 2 seconds, which is a tunable parameter.

### 8.6.3.2 / Typical Scenario Description

**Requirement ID:** FS-513026  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** New  

#### Typical Scenarios:
**Scenario 1:** The warning is triggered when a moving object enters the EAF Detection Zone and intersects with the TTC Warning Zone. The object's path is monitored relative to the vehicle.

**Scenario 2:** The warning is triggered similarly, but the object path now intersects with the Immediate Warning Zone. This indicates a more critical scenario requiring closer monitoring for collision prevention.

The diagrams illustrate the EAF Detection Zone, TTC Warning Zone, Immediate Warning Zone, and Back Zone, demonstrating typical moving object paths that generate warnings.
Page 50
### 8.6.3.2 Typical Scenario Description

Requirement ID: FS-513026  
Type: Functional  
Status: New  

#### Typical Scenarios:
1. **Typical scenario 1**: A moving object intersects the TTC Warning Zone and generates a warning.  
2. **Typical scenario 2**: A moving object intersects the Immediate Warning Zone and generates a warning.  
3. **Typical scenario 3**: A moving object is outside the TTC Warning Zone and Immediate Warning Zone, resulting in no warning.  
4. **Typical scenario 4**: A moving object is outside the Immediate Warning Zone, with an angle greater than 30°; no warning is generated.  
5. **Typical scenario 5**: A moving object is outside the TTC Warning Zone and Immediate Warning Zone, resulting in no warning.  
6. **Typical scenario 6**: A moving object is outside the Immediate Warning Zone, with an angle greater than 30°; no warning is generated.
Page 51
The DOW Function generates a warning with the tracked object that has an intersection point with the 'TTC warning zone' and whose TTC is within 2.5 seconds. The TTC for a target object is calculated as the distance from the bumper to the target vehicle divided by relative velocity.

The DOW Function monitors vehicle door ajar and driver door lock status, and can generate door lock requests along with two levels of warnings (only for the VF9 when the door is locked):
- **Level 1 warning:** A standard optical warning that generates a door lock request if the driver door status is unlocked and preceding warning state is "no warning."
- **Level 2 warning:** A critical optical and audible warning triggered when the door is ajar or a driver door lock action is detected during a level 1 warning. In the case of a door lock action, the level 2 warning lasts for 2 seconds, which is a tunable parameter.

### 8.6.3.2 / Typical Scenario Description
**Requirement ID:** FS-513026  
**Type:** Functional  
**Status:** New  

#### Typical Scenario 1  
The velocity direction of the target object intersects with the 'TTC warning zone.' When the object meets the relevant TTC threshold, the warning is triggered.

#### Typical Scenario 2  
The object is in the 'Immediate warning zone,' and its velocity direction intersects with the 'TTC warning zone.' When the object meets either the relevant TTC threshold or velocity threshold, a warning is triggered.

#### Typical Scenario 3  
(Information for this scenario continues on subsequent pages.)

Page 52
When the Object is approaching from the side and rear and only intersects with the ‘Immediate warning zone’, warning should be suppressed.

**Typical scenario 4:**  
When the object is approaching from the rear and intersects the 'TTC warning zone', the angle between the velocity direction of the object and the X-axis needs to be taken into account. When the angle is greater than 30°, the warning will be suppressed even if the object meets the relevant warning conditions. Otherwise, the warning should be triggered.

**Typical scenario 5:**  
When the target's velocity direction only intersects with the 'Back warning zone', the warning should be suppressed.

**Typical scenario 6:**  
This scenario is similar to Scenario 4, and the angle between the velocity direction of the object and the X-axis should be judged. When the angle is greater than 30°, the warning will be suppressed even if the object meets the relevant warning conditions. Otherwise, the warning should be triggered.

**Typical scenario 7:**  
When the object is outside the ‘Back warning zone’ and its velocity direction is pointing from the rear towards the ego vehicle, the warning should be suppressed.

**Typical scenario 8:**  
It is similar to Scenario 7, where the object is inside the ‘Back warning zone’ and its velocity direction is pointing from the rear towards the ego vehicle. The warning should be suppressed.

**Typical scenario 9:**  
When the object is inside the ‘Back warning zone’ and its velocity direction isn’t directed towards the ego vehicle but intersects with the ‘TTC warning zone’. The warning should be triggered when the angle between the velocity direction of the object and the X-axis is less than 30° and the related TTC threshold has been met.

**Typical scenario 10:**  
When the object is inside the ‘Back warning zone’ and only intersects with the "immediate warning zone", the warning should be suppressed.
