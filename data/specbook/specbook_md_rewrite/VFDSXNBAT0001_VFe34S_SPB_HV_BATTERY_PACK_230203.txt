2.7.4 Thermal System Interface.

The thermal system interface provides the connection between the coolant connector on the housing tray and cooling pipes from the cooling system on the vehicle side. Each cooling connector includes a protection cap to prevent particles from entering the cooling channel. The detailed interface is shown in Figure 28.

Figure 28 Cooling Pipes Interface.

2.7.5 Venting Interface.

A venting interface is included in the RESS. This includes a device known as the air pressure equalization device (APED), and an external vent pipe on the APED for this project. When the APED is not operational, there is a risk that water could enter the RESS. If failures such as cell leakage or refrigerant leakage occur within the RESS, the APED serves as the opening for degassing (EPED). Therefore, the opening must not be blocked, and sufficient clearance to adjacent areas must be maintained. Additionally, it should be noted that the escaping gases can be very hot, posing a burning hazard. The venting interface is depicted in Figure 29.
