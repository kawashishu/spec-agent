### 3.7.3.3 Analyses and test-reports 
The B2P SUP must provide measurement reports (VFDST00008900) in electronic format following agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during prototype development. After individual tests, analysis of test samples is required.

Measurement and test results are to be proven through individual values and documented as part of a test report. This report must be submitted to the responsible VF department for approval. Upon request, the test results and accompanying documentation must be presented to the relevant department to obtain approval.

Tests conducted parallel to production must be planned, documented, and performed regularly or as specified.

### 3.7.4 Test-report/-information

6. Supplier responsibilities.  
Suppliers are responsible to provide/ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements.**

- **After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup:**  
  The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.  

- **Spare Parts Support Cycle:**  
  The support period of after-sales spare parts shall ensure the life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST ends production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SOR.  

- **Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts:**  
  The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc.).
