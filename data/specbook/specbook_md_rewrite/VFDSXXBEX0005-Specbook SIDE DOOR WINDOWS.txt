3.7.2.5 Component testing.
The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed upon between VF, VinFast, and the B2P SUP, and will be binding.

3.7.2.6 Mechanical integration tests.
The following tests will be conducted as mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle:
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100).
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800).
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000).
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600).

No distortion or functional disturbance is allowed across the complete functional temperature range according to VTS. Particular attention must be paid to materials with high and significantly differing thermal expansion coefficients to maintain behavior. The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sun simulation must not be exceeded. 

If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, a detailed description of the parts must be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at the VinFast test department must be provided by the B2P SUP free of charge.

Appendix 2: Reflection inspection method.

**Test equipment:**
- Reflection grid on the room ceiling. Size of grid cell: max 50mm X 50mm.
- Light source.
- Digital camera.
- Rotatable and tiltable frame.

**Test setup:**
- The reflection grid shall have sufficient size to provide the reflection on the complete specimen.
- The center line of the specimen has to be coincident with the gridlines.
- The center line of the camera has to be coincident with the center line of the specimen.
- The inclination of the specimen measured on the center line: 45°.
- Settings of the camera (e.g., zoom, resolution, and so on) have to be notified and used for future inspections.

---

**Reflection grid on the room ceiling illustration:**
The illustration displays the reflection setup, including:
- A tilt angle of 45° for the specimen.
- Horizontal alignment of the camera at a distance of 3m from the specimen.
- Vertical segmentation indicating the upper glass edge, lower glass edge, and the middle H/2.

---

**Definition of master sample:**
- The reflection assessment of the part and definition of the master sample will be made in the presence of customer SQA.
- The defined and signed master samples have to be stored.
- A black-and-white picture of the reflection appearance has to be made and reported in A4-format.
- Serial production control: 3 parts per shift.
