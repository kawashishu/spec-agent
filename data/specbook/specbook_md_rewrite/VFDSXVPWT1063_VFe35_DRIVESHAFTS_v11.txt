- Where the testing was performed (internal/external).
- Duration and time flow of the testing (in form of project plan).
- Part variant, description of part.
- No. of tested components/parts.

Ensure Mileage Target Life: 160000 km or 10 years (whichever comes first).

**4.1 Function Safety (FUSA).**
The supplier shall ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet IATF 16949:2016 standard, Quality management system requirements for automotive production.  
The supplier shall ensure that the developed/manufactured part(s) meet ISO 26262:2018 standard, Road vehicles – Functional safety.

**4.2 Operational strength.**  
**4.2.1 General.**  
Verification of design regarding operational strength of the complete vehicle and all sub systems.
- Ensuring sufficient operational strength concerning the intended, vehicle-typical operational conditions.
- Consideration and verification of product-typical characteristic, derived from the application profile.

All contents are fully applicable for the respective subsystem unless stated otherwise.  
Validation activities which are specifically required for the respective subsystem are defined in this section.
Page 26
DVP&R on component level to be created by the supplier in accordance to fulfillment of complete vehicle targets.

**4.2.2 Static Load Cases**  
Static load cases are defined to calculate the cross-sectional forces within the front and rear axle for specific maneuvers. The applied loads, so-called input loads, are forces and torques which occur in the event of the respective maneuver. The input loads, boundary conditions, and maneuvers are subject to adaption.

**4.2.3 Operating Load**  
Operating loads are the loads occurring during the intended use of the vehicle.  
- Basis for the dimensioning of the operating strength is the maximum load and overall damage target, valid for all components and systems not defined as wearing parts.  
- The statistic proof must be performed on a component level with the defined dimensioning load spectra. Environmental impacts (temperature, corrosion, wasted water among other factors) must be considered.  
- For safety-relevant components, additional safety factors must be considered (pending on material and loading type). Appropriate definitions must be considered in the system and component technical specification books.  

The relevant test tracks for testing of operational loads are for example:  
- Rough road durability run  
- Drive train shortened durability run  
- Lateral force durability run  
- On-road durability run  

The vehicle must be dimensioned so that operational loads can be withstood without any damage for the entire target life.  

The drive shafts, as part of the system, must withstand the testing items defined in the DVP&R under the sections:  
- Complete vehicle durability testing  
- System tests durability  

Critical failures which may lead to a loss of vehicle control must not occur. Testing details, evaluation criteria, and loading programs are outlined in the respective testing standard.

**4.2.4 Load of Exceptional Maneuvers and Misuse Loads**

*Exceptional Maneuver*  
Exceptional maneuvers are occurrences of small quantity (approximately < 100) and are part of the intended use of the vehicle, such as abs-braking, μ-Split/μ-sprung start, etc.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned such that exceptional maneuvers can be withstood without any negative effect on functionality.

*Misuse Maneuver*  
Misuse maneuvers are not part of the intended use of the vehicle. Examples include:  
- Curbstone impact  
- Bump and pothole test  

The vehicle must be dimensioned such that:  
- Damages after misuse must be clearly recognizable for the driver (e.g., steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).
Page 27
A defined damage chain is to be kept in the event of misuse.

A clearly recognizable plastic deformation of the concerning part or neighboring part must occur along with cracks and damages. It is aimed for a deformation before breakage.  
The definition of exceptional maneuvers and misuse loads are stated in the referred document above.  
The subsystem rear axle has to withstand the testing items as defined in the DVP&R under the sections:  
- Complete vehicle exceptional maneuver and misuse.

Testing details, evaluation criteria, and loading programs are to be found in the respective testing standard.

### 4.3 Function Test

Functional testing is performed to ensure the functionality of the system under certain environmental conditions and loadings. The drive shafts as part of the subsystem must undergo the testing items as defined in the DVP&R in the section "Complete vehicle functional testing."
The test items listed are not exhaustive as the complete vehicle performs a large number of functional tests during the development process, which are of different concerns. The rear axle and its single parts must not fail in their function and fulfill the required functional target values if the nature of the test is considered as intended use of the vehicle.  
Testing details, evaluation criteria, and loading programs are to be found in the respective testing standard.

#### Complete Vehicle Testing

All physical testing must be performed in accordance with released testing standards.  
Following tests are done by VinFast:

##### Complete Vehicle Durability Testing
- The Rough road durability run.
- Lateral force durability run.
- Drive train shortened durability run.
- Long-distance durability run (mixed circuit).
- Ambient temperature assumption between -40°C to 50°C.

#### Exceptional Maneuver

The design and development process covers the following maneuvers:
- ABS braking forward/rearward.
- Vehicle towing.
- Vehicle jacking.
- Bump and pothole test (at lower speed).
- Shift down test.

#### Scope of Exceptional Maneuvers and Evaluation Criteria
- Must be agreed upon in the operational strength integration team for the respective vehicle project.
- Vehicle towing.
Page 28
The results of the exceptional maneuvers have to be evaluated in cooperation with the operational strength integration team concerning the number of occurrences and load heights.

### Misuse maneuver
The design and development process covers the following misuse maneuvers:
- Curb stone impact test
- Jump start
- Bump and Pothhole test (at higher speed)
- Extreme braking
- Drive shaft misuse test

#### Scope of misuse maneuvers and evaluation criteria:
- Must be agreed upon in the operational strength integration team for the respective vehicle project.

The results of the misuse maneuvers have to be evaluated in cooperation with the operational strength integration team concerning the number of occurrences and load heights.
