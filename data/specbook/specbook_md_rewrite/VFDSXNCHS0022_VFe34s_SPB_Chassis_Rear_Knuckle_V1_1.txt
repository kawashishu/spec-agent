4 Production quality.

4.1 In Process testing.
In-Process (IP) tests are used to further understand the relationship between significant design and process characteristics and to establish a basis for continuing improvement. Tests must be completed with production parts on an ongoing basis. Sampling plans for both IP testing and evaluation of the significant process characteristics must be included in the Control Plan.

When the process is found to be out of control or the test acceptance criteria are not met, the reaction plan approved in the Control Plan shall be invoked. 

The table that follows summarizes the various IP tests and the acceptance parameters for each. They form the basis on which to develop a complete Control Plan for these and their related significant process characteristics. The Control Plan will include frequencies, sample sizes, and reaction plans.

4.2 Visual Inspection.

All forgings/casting will be 100% inspected in the as-forged/cast condition, after heat treatment, and after machining at the time of packing. 

No surface defects (cracks, notches, malformed areas, etc.) in excess of this table are allowed. These allowable surface defect standards should be made available to the appropriate inspectors and operators at the various manufacturing facilities. 

The following applies to all surfaces, unless otherwise noted.
Page 6
4.2 Visual Inspection.
All forgings and castings will undergo 100% inspection at the following stages: as-forged/cast condition, after heat treatment, and after machining at the time of packing. Surface defects (cracks, notches, malformed areas, etc.) exceeding the defined standards will not be acceptable. These allowable surface defect standards must be made accessible to inspectors and operators at all relevant manufacturing facilities. Unless otherwise stated, the standards apply to all surfaces.

Item standards for discontinuities:
1. Cracks & Hot Tears:
   - Allowed area: None.
   - Allowed zone: None.
   - Standard: Not allowed.

2. Cold Shuts:
   - Allowed area: None.
   - Allowed zone: None.
   - Standard: Not allowed.

   - Allowed area: Locators and all other areas.
   - Allowed zone: Only allowed in green and yellow zones; none in the red zone.
   - Standard: Strict prohibition except acceptable zones.

4.5 Damage thresholds & Figure Visual Guide:
Visual Example correlating.
Page 7
A documented fail-safe system must be established by the supplier approved by Vinfast and be in place at all forging/casting, heat treating, machining, and final assembly facilities/operations to ensure that any non-compliance rear knuckles are removed permanently from the product flow.

4.4 X-RAY Inspection for Porosity, Voids, & Cracks (Applicable only for Casting).
1. X-ray testing for internal discontinuities must be performed after casting as identified in the process control plan. During the PV and IP-I stages, the supplier is responsible for developing specific acceptance standards for all critical areas susceptible to internal discontinuities, such as porosity, shrink, inclusions, etc. These locations and standards must be approved by Vinfast and be consistent with ASTM E155 & E505 references and standards, and be referenced in production control plans.

2. Operators must receive appropriate training in interpreting potential flaws with the particular equipment chosen for the production x-ray inspection procedures. This training must follow EN 473 (General principles for qualification and certification of NDT personnel) or ISO 9712 (Non-destructive testing - Qualification and certification of personnel). Evidence of this training shall be held on file for inspection by Vinfast.

3. Test equipment must be capable of detecting discontinuities greater than or equal to ASTM E155 & E505 Plate 1 in defined critical areas. Film or real-time x-ray may be used provided that the system has proven capability to resolve defects of the minimum standard detailed above.

4. The x-ray inspection equipment must have the capability to allow the inspector to manually inspect any or all areas of the component as deemed necessary. Automatic defect recognition systems may be used after proving capability to resolve defects during the ‘run at rate trial’ on the applicable component with the same efficacy as a trained inspector.

4.5 Fluorescent Dye Penetrant for Surface Defects (Castings/Forgings) (Crack Check).
1. A fluorescent dye penetrant test for cracks and surface discontinuities will be performed on all exterior part surfaces as per ASTM E165 (method A) and ASTM E433.

2. Operators must receive appropriate training in interpreting potential flaws with the equipment chosen for the production dye penetrant inspection procedures. This training must follow EN 473 (General principles for qualification and certification of NDT personnel) or ISO 9712 (Non-destructive testing - Qualification and certification of personnel). Evidence of this training shall be held on file for inspection by Vinfast.

3. Specified defects may be checked for severity by grinding removal if the following conditions are met:
   a. The removal method must be proven not to mask the defect to the fluorescent dye penetrant detection.
   b. The depth of removal must not create stress raisers, thin out wall thickness below the as-cast print specified minimum, or create surface finishes such that no notches are formed which could initiate fatigue cracks. This is defined as any feature not shown on the part drawing with a depth greater than or equal to 1mm and/or root radius less than or equal to 5mm.
   c. The depth of removal must not violate the part print tolerances.

4. If any defects exceed the maximum allowable values or acceptance standards, refer to the reaction plan within the Process Control Plan.

5. All parts inspected during the IP-II phase must be defect-free for 90 production days in order to revoke this requirement. Otherwise, dye penetrant inspection shall continue until Vinfast is satisfied that this process is no longer necessary.

4.6 Feature Removal Standards & Surface Finish (Castings/Forging).
- The maximum allowable flash will be no greater than 0.5 mm. A chamfer allowance of 2 mm (maximum) is acceptable to accommodate this requirement.
- Controlled grinding operations are approved for flash and sharp edge removal to ensure safe part handling. Flash or defect removal must maintain the minimum wall thickness detailed on the part model. Surface finishes after material removal must be fine enough to avoid notches which could initiate fatigue cracks. Notches are defined as features not shown on the part drawing with depth ≥ 1mm and/or root radius ≤ 5mm.
- Material removal should not compromise part function.
- As-cast surface roughness should be ≤ Rz < 65 for cast surface, web, and fettled areas. Equivalent specification applies to forged surfaces.

4.7 Microstructure (Casting) [Aluminium].
- The microstructure must meet silicon eutectic modification, grain size, and secondary dendrite arm spacing to satisfy minimum mechanical requirements.
- Eutectic silicon particles must be rounded and included within an aluminium alloy matrix.
- Aluminium-Silicon eutectic modification must be ≥ class 4 according to the Microstructure Control in Hypoeutectic Aluminium-Silicon alloys chart by the American Foundry Society.
- Secondary Dendritic Arm Spacing (SDAS) must be < 30 micrometers. Frequency of checks is once per heat treat batch using sections from tensile samples.

Forging/Casting [Aluminium].
- Microstructure checks include grain size, grain orientation, grain extension ratio, and end-of-flow lines to achieve mechanical requirements.
- End-of-flow lines should not terminate on sharp corners or radial features.

4.8 Mechanical Properties (Casting/Forging).
- Mechanical properties should follow ASTM B108 and B557 procedures or relevant ASTM standards for forgings/castings.
- For batch furnace heat treat lots, two (2) test bars from three (3) pairs (12 total components per heat treat lot) must be taken from specified component areas post-heat treatment as shown in FIGURE 4.4. Upon agreement with Vinfast and sufficient replicable data, the sample size can be reduced to two (2) test bars from one (1) pair (4 total components) per heat treat lot.
- Tensile bar sizes and types must comply with BS-EN 10002-1 standards. Testing requires 6mm gauge diameter specimens, with other dimensions derived from BS-EN standards.
