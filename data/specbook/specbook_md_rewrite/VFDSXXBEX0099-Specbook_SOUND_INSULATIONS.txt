Should tests be conducted on incorrect parts or with incorrect procedures, retesting must be performed at the cost of B2P SUP. Negative test results necessitate re-planned tests, also at B2P SUP's expense if they are responsible for the failure.  

3.7.2 Test Plan Example.  
DVP must be updated weekly with the following points:  
- Declaration of standards, norms, legal requirements.  
- Description of testing device and setup.  
- Responsible test department.  
- Testing location (internal/external).  
- Test duration and timeline (project plan format).  
- Part variant descriptions.  
- Number of tested components/parts.  

3.7.3 Testing.  

3.7.3.1 General.  
The B2P SUP must provide a detailed plan ensuring testing is performed in accordance with the vehicle timing chart. Testing must guarantee the worst-case component/system variant is included.  

Mechanical and electrical tests should be combined where possible to prevent duplicate testing.  

The supplier is required to download VinFast test standards via the Supplier Collaboration Portal/TC. A measurement report for each sample part must be included with delivery unless otherwise agreed.  

Component developers must ensure compliance with all relevant legislations for their components, as well as conformity to VinFast performance specifications.  

All test results must be documented in reports with supporting photos and submitted to VF. Testing must satisfy target market law obligations and adhere to either VinFast standards or accepted B2P SUP standards.  

A DVP&R template must accompany the offer, specifying tests for all development phases, and sample inspections must meet the agreed dates.  

Samples for form and surface evaluation must be presented at VF approval offices alongside the Cubing and Appearance Approval reports.  

Marking, preparation, and evaluation of sample parts must comply with VF standards (VFDST00008700, VFDST00008900, VFDST00008300).  

3.7.3.2 Release by Test Departments.  
The VF test department only releases components upon successful achievement of test targets by B2P SUP. Positive test reports must be provided for all required tests. In case of issues, a detailed problem report along with proposed solutions must be submitted.  

Reports must clearly state OK or NOK results on the first sheet.  

3.7.3.3 Analyses and Test Reports.  
B2P SUP must deliver electronic measurement reports (VFDST00008900) in agreed formats and concepts for all prototype parts. Test samples must undergo detailed analysis following individual tests.
Page 16
3.7.4 Test-report/-information.  
- Description/picture of the part with documentation (part no., change index, materials, production process, additives like grease, and every deviation from the approved serial process).  
- All parts have to be labeled with a description.  
- Eventually, the reason for testing, in case of e.g. negative test results, and attachment of earlier test reports.  
- Testing with exact naming of testing standard, norm, legal requirement, or exact description of agreed testing procedure.

3.7.5 Documentation of result.  
- Short description of the result (pictures, tables, detailed results, photo documentation, comparison with earlier test reports, evaluation of result OK/NOK, pictures of the parts in testing position, etc.).  
- Comparison with results of the specification book, testing specification, legal requirements, etc.  
- Recommendation.  
- Description of corrective measures or further approach in case of a negative test result.  
- Progressional testing status.  
- Listing of all tests in a table with the responsible person, part status, and comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the B2P SUP has to provide a new date for re-test with countermeasures to VF for approval along with a responsible person and company to perform the test.  

The VF test engineer must be informed within two working days in the event of negative test results.  
The VF test engineer must be informed in periodic intervals with the actual status and progress.  
If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts has to be attached.  

3.7.6 Archival storage of tested parts.  
Testing parts are only allowed to be scrapped if the VinFast test department agrees to that. On-demand of the test engineer, the complete testing documentation (reports, parts, and descriptions) must be presented.  

3.7.7 Virtual testing.  
Suitable calculation methods are to be used and adequately detailed calculation models created by the B2P SUP for the purpose of securing, verifying, and effectively optimizing the component properties defined in the technical specification, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations.  

The requirements related to the mechanical properties of the component in particular, such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, are to be secured by means of FEM calculations.

3.7.7 Virtual testing  
Suitable calculation methods are to be used and adequately detailed calculation models created by the B2P SUP for the purpose of securing, verifying, and effectively optimizing the component properties defined in the technical specification, test procedures, and valid laws/regulations. The requirements related to the mechanical properties of the component, in particular such as rigidity, strength, dimensional stability under heat, and passive safety, are to be secured by means of FEM calculations.

The tool-dimensioning for the injection molding is to optimize by corresponding simulations. On request, the operative calculation models that represent the respective development status are to be made available at any time to the requesting technical departments of VF for the purpose of internal calculations and integration work.

On request from VinFast, the B2P SUP has to provide suitable FEM models without extra cost. The tests from the B2P SUP, according to the evaluation plan, must be calculatively documented (e.g., FEM) before the tool dimensioning.

3.7.8 Component testing  
The detailed required testing will be defined in the DVP. The DVP has to be agreed between VF, VinFast, and the B2P SUP, and will be binding.

3.7.9 Mechanical integration tests  
The following tests will be performed as mechanical integration tests in a complete vehicle:
- Climatic change test (VFDST00046100)
- Sunlight simulation (VFDST00053800)
- Mounting/dismounting (VFDST00009000)
- Vibration combined with temperature (VFDST00062600)

No distortion and no functional disturbance on the whole functional temperature range according to VTS is allowed. When using materials with high and very different thermal expansion coefficients, their behavior has to be kept. The tolerances of the flush and gap plan after the climate test and sunlight simulation must not be exceeded.

If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts must be attached. Parts needed for testing activities at the VinFast test department must be provided by the B2P SUP free of charge.

3.8 Appearance Approval - Applicable for all Visible Parts  
AAR is a PPAP deliverable. The AAR process is described in VFDST00038401 (quantity of parts, timing).  

For each step of the process, the supplier has the responsibility to submit parts to VF Quality Design following agreed timing with VF to get OK Shape, OKTG, and AAR Approval. The process will start in the early phase at PT build to secure AAR Approval at LS.  

The supplier must include this activity in their development process and ED&D Cost.
