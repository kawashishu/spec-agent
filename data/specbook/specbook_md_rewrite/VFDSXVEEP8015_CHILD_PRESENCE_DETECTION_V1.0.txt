Definitions and applicable documents.

4.1 CAD Data/Transfer data-CAD Requirements.
All CAD data must be designed with CATIA V5 following VF standard VFDST00000014. CAD data transfer from VinFast to the supplier will be done through the Supplier collaborative module. For more details, refer to the Supplier collaborative module in the RFQ package.

4.2 Change Documentation and Part History Documentation.
During the development and production process, all changes within the framework of the contractor must be documented and provided to VinFast and OEM/Supplier by the contractor (e.g., entries in a project manual). The form of the data can be defined by the contractor. Vehicle Documentation Systems or components that must fulfill safety regulations of authorities or legal requirements must be remarked on the drawings. The reasons and the characteristics that must be documented are listed by authorities. These demands will be requested during the development of the part and latest in the PTO phase.

Description and scope of work.

5 Description and scope of work.

5.1 Technical requirement.
The technical information should display: VinFast designated part number, usage per car, procurement code, part applicability to C-SUV ICE and C-SUV BEV. Technical requirements include part design, functional requirements, and performance requirements at the VinFast level. For details, refer to Table 1:

**Table 1: Technical information table**  
| No | Part Name                       | Part No.     | Qty | Material | Purchase Level | ICE | BEV |

5.2 Functional requirement.
The mid and premium versions of VinFast vehicles shall feature several ADAS capabilities strongly enhancing road safety and driving comfort. The ADAS system targets level 2 automated driving, assisting drivers with daily tasks and improving safety for passengers. To meet ASEAN NCAP 5* standards (road map 2025), the system must adhere to NCAP testing protocols and satisfy requirements. Suppliers are expected to study NCAP requirements to achieve target points.

VINFAST aims to score their vehicles for U.S. NCAP 5* (2022–2025). Suppliers developing ADAS system architecture for SOP 2020 must allow scalability and feature additions for future compliance. In absence of U.S. NCAP documents, EU-NCAP guidelines can be adapted. System descriptions and supplier clarifications are essential. Refer to appendices for brief NCAP overviews. Requirements for features, variants, markets, and ASIL level are outlined below:

**Feature Table:**  
| Domains    | Ab. | Feature                 | Responsible         | Vietnam | Vietnam | U.S.  | ASIL |  
|------------|-----|-------------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|-------|------|  
| In-Cabin Monitoring | CPD | Child Presence Detection | Phuong Dinh Le       | YES     | YES     | YES   | QM   |  

Suppliers are responsible for proposing comprehensive solutions comprising components, system architecture, etc., to implement the designated features.

5.2.1 Child Presence Detection (CPD).
Children are vulnerable and unable to escape from locked cars, risking fatal heatstroke (hyperthermia). In the U.S., there is increasing demand for systems detecting children in vehicles to alert drivers to risks.

**Table—Child Presence Detection:**  
| Part Name                   | Part No.      | Quantity | Task                              | Requirements |

| CHILD_PRESENT_PROTECTION_RADAR | EEP30008015 | 1        | Detect if there are children left in the car | TBD          |  

5.2.1.1 Elements of Systems.  
Various mechanisms exist to detect child presence in vehicles, including pressure-sensing pads under seat fabrics, visible and infrared light-based vision detection, and radar technology. Suppliers must define complete system components and confirm specifications with VINFAST.
Page 9
**5.2.1.2 Function definition:**  
The function shall detect the presence of infants or children in general and make the driver aware of their presence inside the car. In case the driver or connected persons do not respond, the system shall activate various warning/alarming mechanisms such as lamp flashing or horn beeping.

**5.2.1.3 Performance requirement:**
- The system shall be able to detect the presence of children under varying lighting conditions, ranging from normal daylight to a fully dark cabin.
- The detection mechanism shall remain functional despite varying temperatures, up to 60 degrees inside cars. This may pose challenges.
- The system shall be capable of detecting life under fabric covers, which often happens when children are placed on car seats.
- The system shall comply with or account for the requirements of the E-NCAP 2022 and ASEAN NCAP 2021-2025 protocols.
- Compliance for US and Canadian markets must address legal and consumerist requirements. Performance should enable VINFAST to obtain maximum CPD scoring based on consumerist protocols.
- Additional requirements may be discussed between VINFAST and the Supplier.

**Shortfall of Function:**  
The indication of system malfunction shall be communicated to the driver.

**5.3 General CAE Requirements:**  
Please refer to Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL.

**5.4 Material requirement:**  
Material details must include weight, grade, and density.

**5.5 Traceability:**  
For part requirements, follow specifications outlined in VinFast standards VFDST00010502 and VFDST00010501.
