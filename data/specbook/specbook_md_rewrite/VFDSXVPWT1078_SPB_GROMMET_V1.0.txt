## 5 Deliverables

### 5.1 Technical Deliverables

**Work Interface Chart (RASI):**  
The main supplier obligations are outlined in the Work Interface Chart (RASI). The supplier's role as a "System Development Supplier" is defined in the relevant System or Component Specification.

#### RASI Roles and Definitions:  
- **R: Responsible**  
  Accountable for proper execution of activities to fulfill requirements. May request support from project team members.
  
- **A: Approval**  
  Has the authority for decision-making and release. If no decision-maker is defined, the Responsible person will act as the decider.

5.2 Details deliverables and RASI.

S: Support. Obligated to active support (even if this requires capacity, expenses, and/or transfer of know-how). This project team member must proactively assist the person responsible for execution R in achieving the targets.

I: Information. Right to information. This team member is entitled to demand information from R.

The RASI table provides a structured overview of deliverables required in various project stages, highlighting the roles and responsibilities of VinFast Engineering, Purchasing, Suppliers, SQE, and Manufacturing teams. The table aligns project phases, including concept development, production preparations, and testing phases, with specific obligations and expectations for all parties involved.

For example:
- During the Concept Phase (Gate PV), the supplier plays a Responsible role (R) for creating the "List of Concept in Commodity," with active Support (S) from VF Purchasing and Information (I) shared with other departments.
- In the PPS stage, detailed deliverables include "Supply chain strategy - Deliver Sourcing Strategy" for which VF Purchasing holds the Responsible role (R), while Suppliers provide Support (S).

Detailed testing and validation protocols (Gate PPS) define accountabilities for "DVP (virtual and physical testing) for System, Sub-system & Component Level." Here, the supplier has the Responsible role (R), with VF Engineering offering Approval (A), highlighting the collaborative yet hierarchical structure of responsibilities.

The deliverables phase concludes with milestone contributions such as "Package study to support B-class surface development" in Gate TA, managed with a balanced distribution of Approval (A), Responsibility (R), and Support (S) roles.

Note: Suppliers must align RASI revisions with the latest Master Timing from PMO side.
