All possible measures must be taken to prevent operating noises (e.g., wind noise and whining noise) completely or deaden them to the greatest extent possible to achieve acceptable noise levels.

The gas-tightness and water-tightness are essential for acoustical tightness and must be appropriately achieved. Chattering or squeaking effects occurring during high-speed driving, particularly under certain humidity levels, must be avoided through a suitable profile design and by choosing the right surface coating process of high-quality material pairing. High-quality materials must offer adequate durability as well.

All components of the seal system must be designed to reduce aerodynamic resistance and optimize aero-acoustic characteristics. Subcomponents must not have any burrs related to manufacturing processes unless approved by the function specialist. All fixation points (i.e., screws, clips) must be airtight sealed, except upon approval by the function specialist.

Components must remain mechanically stable even at the highest possible speed ranges. No deformation of the component is permitted, and flat surfaces must be supported by an appropriate stiffening structure underneath. Components must remain stable over their lifetime, without deformation or shrinkage due to temperature, moisture, dirt, UV radiation. Adhesive materials must retain their specified adhesion.

The supplier must guarantee:
- No amplification of wind noise and vibrations on BIW.

3.7.1 Test Plan.
The test plan dictates individuals responsible for testing, the timeline of testing, and necessary devices. It reflects testing results visually and tracks testing progress. Testing outcomes must be controlled consistently.

Tests are delegated to the contracted B2P SUP. Test procedures and documentation require the approval of VinFast's validation engineers and component lead engineers. The plan shall be weekly updated or supplemented with additional data/information based on development changes.

The B2P SUP must ensure VinFast receives all relevant test protocols/reports and allow VinFast participation in testing at B2P SUP sites or centers. Any deviations to testing procedures must be mutually agreed upon between VinFast and B2P SUP. If tests were executed using incorrect or missing parts, or under improper procedures, the tests must be repeated, with costs covered by B2P SUP. In the case of negative test results caused by supplier failures, B2P SUP must reorganize and fund the retests.

The following data must be included in the DVP&R:
