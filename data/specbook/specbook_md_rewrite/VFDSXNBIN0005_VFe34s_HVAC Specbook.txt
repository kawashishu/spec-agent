**Interior Airflow Quantities Test Condition**

- **Description:** Interior Ventilation Air Management (Unit only)  
  - Air volume at total vent: (RECIRC) 500 m³/h  
  - Air volume at total FDOT circulation (OSA): 300 m³/h  
  - Air volume at total DEF circulation (OSA): 370 m³/h  
  - Test condition: Back pressure: 0kPa  
  - Test voltage: 12V  
  - **Remark:** HVAC test equipment and test room cannot control the air temperature.  
    - Refer to other room ambient temperature.  

---

**Interior Cooling Performance Test Condition**

- **Refrigerant Heat Rejection Capacity:**  
  - Test Condition:  
    - Refrigerant: R134a and R1234yf.  
    - Heat Exchanger Air velocity: 1.2-1.4 m/s.  
    - Coolant temperature: Air Out: <2°C; Air In: 50%.  
    - FDOT: Air circulation volume: 500 m³/h, Back pressure: 0kPa.  
  - **Remark:** If set with absolute pressure, the refrigerant will be frozen, so should be gauge pressure.  
    - If oil separation in the system less than 15%, there is a possibility that the compressor will be broken.

**Evaporator Core + Pipe Test Conditions**

1. **Leak Test Criteria:**  
   - **Testing methodology:** Small leak detection via: helium pressure (0.7-1.2 MPa), leak detector, or mass spectroscopy.  
   - Refrigerant leakage: Leakage is less than 5g/year for R134a.  
   - **Remark:** Proposed AITS's method with hydronic oil.  

2. **Pressure Cycle Test Condition:**  
   - Hydraulic test pressure: 1.4 MPa (reference point 1 MPa).  
   - No leakage after 100,000 pressure cycles under these conditions.  
   - **Remark:** Proposed AITS's method with hydronic oil for cycle test compliance.  

3. **Burst Test Condition:**  
   - Measure serious deformation or leakage. Pressure is over 70 MPa.  
   - **Remark:** Proposed AITS's method with hydronic oil for burst pressure evaluation.
