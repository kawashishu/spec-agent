For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low:**  
   Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

2. **Corrosivity Medium:**  
   Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  

3. **High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  

4. **Very High Corrosivity:**  
   Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.  

The vehicle exterior is generally considered as an area with high corrosivity.  
Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. In case of a critical material combination, a proper coating must be added (e.g., paint, plastic coating, insulating spacers).  

- Avoid water and dirt accumulation, always provide drainage in lowest positions.  
- Also avoid dirt traps, where sand can work as an abrasive and damage the painted body by micro-movements.  
- Contact surfaces to the body shall be dry, large enough for low pressure, and made of non-abrasive material. Minimize micro-movement.  
- Edge coverage: Ensure burr-free edges and a paint system with good edge coverage.  

### Corrosion Tests
The parts must pass both System/Component tests and a complete vehicle corrosion test.  

**Component Test for Metallic Surfaces:**  
- Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria are provided below.  

**For Organic Coatings:**  
- Cyclic corrosion test (CCT): ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria are provided below.  

Alternative tests may be proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.  
**Test Criteria:** (Details not included in the image but would be listed separately.)

Material combinations shall be chosen so that galvanic corrosion does not occur. This includes fasteners and attached brackets. Avoid direct contact with more noble metals like steel, stainless steels, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners, etc., that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.

**Terminals and connectors:**
Do not place terminals on lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is first of all a requirement for tightness. Electrical connections must be protected from humidity.

**Groundings:**
Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.

**Aluminium/sealing surfaces:**
Avoid aluminium alloys with copper and iron content greater than 1% for components with sealing surfaces, as they are very sensitive to corrosion. Corrosion may penetrate the seal very fast, opening it for moisture to enter.

**Prevention of stone chipping issues:**
The risk of damage to the bodywork and related parts by stone chipping must be minimized by design measures:
- Wherever possible, provide shielding parts for easily damageable parts.
- Enlarging radii of parts in high-risk areas can help to prevent severe issues.
- In areas of high stone-hitting risk, choose part materials and paint with the same color to avoid easily visible abrasion marks.
- Avoid developing parts with edges pointing in the vehicle's driving direction.
- For chromed styling elements on the lower areas of the vehicle: deepen them so that they cannot be hit easily by stones.

Page 21
5.9 Operational Strength (Stiffness/Strength/Durability)
- Mounting force must be lower than dismounting force.

Operating loads:
Operating loads are the loads which occur during the intended use of the vehicle. These loads are derived by measurements with the base reference vehicles on tracks defined by VF.  
The definition of the customer usage is based on the VinFast standard for MCE (mixed circuit Europe = long distance durability run). The tested mileage is derived from the target for the desired customer mileage of the car, which is 160,000 km.  
The vehicle lifetime shall be at least 10 years. 

The environmental operating conditions are:
- -30°C to +50°C ambient  
- 0–100% relative humidity  
- -100 m to 3500 m above mean sea level  

Special events:
Special events are occurrences of small frequency (approx. < 100), which belong to the intended use of the vehicle, e.g. ABS braking.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned in a way that special events do not affect the function while no safety-relevant damages occur, and the intended service life will not be reduced.  

Misuse events:
Misuse events are events that are not included in the vehicle usage intention, e.g. curbstone impact.  
The vehicle must be dimensioned so that:
- Damages after misuse are clearly recognizable by the driver (e.g. steering wheel inclined conditions, wheel inclined conditions, etc.).  
- A defined damage chain is kept after misuse (e.g. easy replaceable parts before body structure).  

Cracks or damages only occur together with clearly recognizable plastic deformations—either to the same or at neighboring components (principle “deformation before break”).
