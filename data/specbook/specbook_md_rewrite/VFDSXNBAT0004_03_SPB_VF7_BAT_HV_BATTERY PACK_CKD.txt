3.5.2 Pyro-Fuse Description.
The basic function of the Pyro-Fuse component, shown in Figure 6, is the controlled creation of permanent galvanic isolation for high-voltage safety applications. Similar to a circuit breaker or fuse, this component is a normally closed device, enabling current flow between its two high-voltage contacts (copper busbars). Upon receiving a specific trigger signal, it interrupts current flow and isolates the two HV contacts permanently.

The operation principle is illustrated in the figure: when triggered, the pyrotechnic igniter propels a piston that cuts the copper busbar at two distinct points. The severed section is fixed in the end position.

Below is a table listing the key functional specifications of the CB500-2. More stringent requirements than those listed are possible, but extensive testing must confirm their feasibility.

3.5.2 Pyro-Fuse Description.  
The basic function of this component is the controlled creation of a permanent galvanic isolation for HV-safety applications. It operates akin to a circuit breaker or fuse and is normally a closed device conducting current via its two HV contacts. When triggered, its pyrotechnic component propels a piston to cut the copper busbar, permanently isolating the HV contacts.

### DC Charge

The DC charge section utilizes a structured table showcasing charging parameters at various SOC levels and temperature ranges. This allows precise charging adjustments based on specific conditions, ensuring optimal performance and safety.

### AC charge

#### 3.8.3.2.1 Charge Start Condition:
When the external charging conditions are met (e.g., CCCP is valid), and there is no relevant warning on the battery, and the battery SOC is not 100%, the BMS starts the charging process.

#### 3.8.3.2.2 Charging Process Control:
During the charging process, the BMS detects voltage, current, and temperature in real time, estimates the SOC, and assesses related warnings. Based on voltage, SOC, and temperature conditions, the charging request current is adjusted dynamically.

#### 3.8.3.2.3 Charge Completion Condition:
During charging, when the highest voltage of the cell reaches the "cell charge cut-off voltage", or the battery pack voltage reaches the "battery pack charge cut-off voltage", the charging current begins to decrease. Charging is completed once the voltage exceeds the "charge cut-off voltage of the battery pack", and the charging current falls below the "charge cut-off current". When this condition is met, the SOC is corrected to 100%.
