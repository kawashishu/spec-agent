1 General Document Guidelines.

1.1 Purpose and Legal Binding.
This version is legally binding.

This document is based on the VDA component requirement specification structure. It consists of universal requirements for the “General Project Requirements for Suppliers” (Part 1 - level 1), Common Electric Specifications (applicable documents of Part 1 - level 1), the “System / Component Specification Book for Supplier” for mechanical and mechatronic systems/components (Part 2 - level 2), and general “Further Applicable Documents” (Part 3 - level 3).

Requirement documents are divided into three levels, which are complementary to each other (e.g., what is not included in Part 1 can be included in Part 2, and so on). All three levels are legally binding. If there is a conflict with regard to content, the higher level is applicable (e.g. level 3 vs level 2 → level 2 is applicable).

1.2 Language.
This document is written in English.

All official project documentations have to be done in English. If documents are bilingual, the English text is binding.

1.3 Obligation of Requirement Wording.
The following wording rules are used throughout this document.

**Shall.**
The word “shall” is used to state a binding requirement. Such requirements are externally verifiable by manipulation or observation.

**Should.**
The word “should” is used for preferences or desires in implementation that are not strictly binding.

**May.**
The word “may” is used to denote options that are left to the implementer.

### 9.3 Resistance to Media and Chemical Requirements

#### 9.3.1 Contamination  

#### 9.3.2 Cleaning  
Covered in DVPR.  

#### 9.3.3 Corrosion Protection  
**Corrosion Requirement Determination:**  
Corrosivity position classification for each system component is required:  
1. **Corrosivity Low:** Not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
2. **Corrosivity Medium:** At most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, road (deicing) salts.  
3. **High Corrosivity:** Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.  
4. **Very High Corrosivity:** Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

**Enclosure Design:**  
Electrically functional units in enclosed air casings and boxes must be ventilated with a moisture-resistant membrane (type Gortex) in wet locations.  

**Material Considerations:**  
Material combinations shall prevent galvanic corrosion, which includes fasteners and attached brackets.
Page 30
Avoid direct contact to more noble metals like steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, nickel, and conductive or anti-static rubber in environments affected by wetness. Use surface treatment on steel fasteners that are long-term corrosion-resistant and fully compatible with other materials.

The electrical components must be installed so that vibrations do not generate fretting corrosion.

**Terminals, connectors:** Do not place terminals at the lowest points. Corrosion protection of terminals is primarily a requirement for tightness—electrical connections must be protected from humidity.

**Groundings:** Connecting surfaces of grounding must be water-tight if placed in a corrosive environment.

**Aluminum/sealing surfaces:** Aluminum alloys with copper and iron content of > 1% are very sensitive to corrosion and should be avoided for components that have sealing surfaces. Corrosion may penetrate the seal very quickly, allowing moisture to enter.

---

### Corrosion Tests
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test. Before and after corrosion testing, a functional testing is required to be conducted.

- **Component test for Metallic surfaces:** Salt spray test: ISO9227, acceptance criteria detailed below.

9.5 Mechanical Requirements.

9.5.1 Load.  

**Operating loads:**  
Operating loads arise during normal use, determined from benchmark vehicles tested on VinFast-designated tracks. Test mileage from these measures reflects target distances for customer usage as in chapter 5.18.  

**Special events:**  
Occasional events (approx. < 100 occurrences), like ABS-braking, require the vehicle to withstand without impairing its function or lifecycle.  

**Misuse events:**  
Events not intended for normal usage, like curbstone impacts, must meet these requirements:
- Damage is immediately recognizable: bent steering/wheel alignment.  
- A defined damage sequence allows prioritization for replaceable parts over structural damage.  
Plastic deformation is preferred over breakage ("deformation before break").
