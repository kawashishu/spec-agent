---

### Integration of Add-on Parts
- Ensuring proper assembly of additional components and functionality.

### Providing Full Functionality over Lifetime
- Guaranteeing continued usefulness and reliability throughout the lifespan of the components.

---

**Overall Function**

#### Development Targets:
- Prevention of functional and qualitative problems stemming from known systems.
- Usage of standard and common parts where practical or feasible.
- Achieving process reliability in production, packaging, transport, and assembly.
- Minimizing effort across the overall production sequence, including production, packaging, transport, and on-line assembly.
- Prevention of displacement during various processes.
- Integration of all involved partners in the comprehensive process of the part package (Simultaneous Engineering) starting from the concept phase. Early collaboration with developers of neighboring components (e.g., body shell, finishing systems).
- General reduction of costs compared to previous models.
- Enhancement of acoustic, optical, and functional features.
- Ensuring functionality under a temperature range of -30°C (-5°C for the Vietnam market) to +85°C for areas above the beltline, and -30°C (-5°C for the Vietnam market) to +85°C for areas below the beltline.

---

**Stiffness / Rigidity / Stability of Shape**
- Operational elements and bracket design must ensure absence of noticeable instability.
- Irregular joint shapes, excessive clearance, and visible waviness caused by climatic change loads are strictly prohibited.

---

**Trim Parts Requirements**
- Detaching, fracturing, or splitting of parts is strictly forbidden, including during crash tests and airbag deployment, even at low temperatures.

---

**Product Characteristics**
- Components of trim parts must account for all tolerances of parts and assemblies, including heat expansion.
- Components' functionality must be proven under all existing tolerances, includes heat extension.
- Material-specific thermal expansions must be calculated when defining gap tolerances.
- Post-climate test deformation must stay within the specified tolerance for flush and gap dimensions.
- Tolerance analyses must be provided to the relevant development personnel or departments.
- Compatibility and assemblability with adjacent components must be prioritized.
- Bolt mountings must employ metallic inserts.
- Functional performance must be guaranteed under all specified load conditions, as defined by drawings, test specifications, quality standards, and legal documents.
- Noise generation due to unfavorable tolerances in components or joints must be eliminated.

5.2 General CAE Requirements.  
Please refer Appendix 2: CAE-FEM-GENERAL.  

5.3 Material requirement.  
Detailed material specifications must be defined, including weight, grade, and density, and should be input in Table 1 (see Section 5.1).

Material and production-compliant design layouts of components should avoid production-related surface flaws/defects such as tool parting points/lines, streaks, flow marks, wall thickness irregularities, or stress zones.  

Material-compliant fits, curvatures, corners, and edges should allow visual parallel alignment of joints and offset-free surfaces.  

Uniform, proportionally accurate, and material-compliant run-out of component edges, corners, and ribs must be ensured.  

Concepts and production methods should facilitate homogeneous structures and grain consistency.  

Visible screw points, screw point covers, and dummy covers should be avoided.  

Surfaces should be free of burrs in the visual and tactile zone.  

No view of other parts is allowed; it should not be possible to recognize other components through grilles, trim covers, indentations, joints, or cavities. A neat and tidy overall impression must be maintained.
Page 14
Ensuring correct material pairing, surfaces, structures, and connection concepts with regard to disturbance noise. Free of disturbing noise and odor in contact with the environment at all temperatures and driving conditions. Surfaces have to be designed due to DINENISO 1302 [14]. Quality requirements at the supplier from production material are defined under “N85065” [40].

In order to coordinate the form and the surface, corresponding samples including Cubing reports and Appearance Approval reports (see VFDST00038400 [12] for color matching/appearance approval and VDA 280 part 1 [47]) must be presented by the supplier to the corresponding approval offices of VINFAST.

Matching parts must be submitted by the supplier in accordance with timing requirements from the matching department.

### Environmental Compatibility
The minimization of environmental impacts of a product through its complete life cycle is a key factor for future development of innovative products.

#### Environmental impact minimization requirements:
- **Use of recyclable materials.**
- **Use of recycled materials and renewable resources.**
- **Prevention of hazardous substances.**
- **Minimization of compartment emissions, including odor.**
- **Minimization of consumption of resources.**
- **Strategy for waste prevention.**
- **Parts marking for identification at the end of life.**

### Material Information, Parts Marking & Substance Information for VinFast
- The conformance to prohibited and restricted substances and obligations in terms of notification must be ensured for new parts, modified parts, carry-over parts, off-the-shelf parts, and spare parts by the supplier.
  - The conformance to prohibited substances must be ensured by the supplier through the complete product life cycle.
  - For PPAP material data sheets (MDS) in IMDS, adherence to IMDS Rules and Guidelines IMDS 001 and IMDS Recommendations 002-022 is required. Updates are mandatory when changes occur. 
  - Material data sheets must be submitted by the supplier to VinFast IMDS-ID 214435.
- Parts marking should follow the rule “as few characters as possible but as many as necessary.” The marking consists of brief type designations defined by DIN, EN, or ISO standards (ISO takes priority). These codes are enclosed in arrowed brackets composed of mathematical signs for “greater than” (>) and “less than” (<).
- Material safety data sheets (SDS) must comply with Vietnam Law on Chemicals No. 06/2007/QH12 (including the national chemical inventory 2017) and must be provided to VinFast as part of the milestone concept confirmation. Local rules for SDS creation and UN guidelines (GHS—Globally Harmonized System of Classification, Labelling, and Packaging of Chemicals) must be considered.
