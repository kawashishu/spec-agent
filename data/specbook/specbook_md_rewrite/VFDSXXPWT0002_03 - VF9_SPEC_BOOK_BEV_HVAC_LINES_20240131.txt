2 Specification summary.

**Technical requirements summary (1):**  
Refer to DVP for Targets and acceptance criteria.  

**Material:**  
Al3103 / GY4882 / GY4890 / Al 6061 – T6 / EPDM / Al 5052 – H32 / PA66 / 10B21 / DC01.  

**Functional / Performance:**  
In these pipe installations, freon (e.g., R134a, R1234yf) mixed with compressor oil (e.g., PAG/POE synthetic oil) acts as a refrigerant. It circulates in the system where it undergoes continuous pressure and temperature fluctuations.  

**Part quality:**  
See in 2D drawing.  

**Figure Description:**  
This section contains diagrams of two HVAC Line assemblies:  
1. **PWT80111105:** The image depicts a detailed view of the high-pressure and low-pressure pipe assembly designed for VN Plus configuration.  
2. **PWT80111106:** The image represents the high-pressure and low-pressure pipe assembly for US Plus configuration.  

Both assemblies show distinct pipe bends and connectors with colored markings for differentiation of line functions and materials used.
