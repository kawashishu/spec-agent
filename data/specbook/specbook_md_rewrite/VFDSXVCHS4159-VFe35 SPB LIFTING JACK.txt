**Testing Specification of Scissor Type Jack.**

1. **Performance Test** (Procedure Title: JIS-D-8103)  
   Requirement: Operate the Jack for 03 times repeatedly from the center position to the max position and back at 120% of rated capacity. After the test, cool the test part and inspect thoroughly throughout the operating range.  
   Sample: 3  

2. **Load Withstand Test** (Procedure Title: JIS-D-8103)  
   Requirement: Apply vertical static load equal to 150% of nominal load at the max stroke of the Jack for 03 minutes. There should not be any deformation, breaking, or other abnormalities to be observed.  
   Sample: 3  

3. **Compound Angle Load Test** (Procedure Title: JIS-D-8103)  
   Requirement: Raise the Jack to the center of stroke and set it at 6X45° w.r.t. direction of inclined surface. Then apply vertical static nominal load on the center of top for 03 minutes. The Jack must be free from permanent deformation, breakage, and other abnormalities.  
   Sample: 3  

4. **Inclined Load Test** (Procedure Title: JIS-D-8103)  
   Requirement: Raise the Jack to the center of stroke and set it at 6° w.r.t. direction of inclined surface. Then apply vertical static nominal load on the center of top for 03 minutes. The Jack must be free from permanent deformation, breakage, and other abnormalities.  
   Sample: 3  

5. **Operating Torque Test** (Procedure Title: JIS-D-8103)  
   Requirement: Operating Torque must be ≤ 25 Nm when raised from middle to max height with 100% nominal load.  
   Sample: 3  

6. **Durability Test** (Procedure Title: AS/NZS 2693:2007)  
   Requirement:  
   - Set the Jack at the position of fully lowered position + 10% height of full stroke for safe working.  
   - Place the Jack under Test Rig and raise the Jack at fully raised position, checking that the maximum force transmitted through the Jack is equal to the nominal capacity of the Jack.  
   - Operate the Jack from the lowest to the highest Stroke for 50 cycles (set interval of 03 minutes between Upper & Lower Position for Cooling the Jack).  
   - Take off the load and check the Jack if it is functioning or not.  
   Sample: 3  

7. **Neutral Salt Spray Test** (Procedure Title: ISO 9227)  
   Requirement: No Red Rust on the part up to 132 hours.  
   Sample: 3
