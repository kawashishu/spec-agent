3.2 Technical requirement.

The supplier is requested to provide different pipes and hoses for the air spring system. The Aeration Pipe and Intake hose are mounted to the Body or the ASU bracket and will provide atmosphere to the compressor unit. Furthermore, they will hinder the compressor from taking in water. The Gallery Hose connects the compressor unit to the valve block and provides pressurized air (maximum approx. 18 bar) to it.

7 Supplier responsibilities.
The supplier is responsible to provide or ensure while completing the work. Supplier responsibilities are itemized to help mitigate the risk to the organization of an employer-employee relationship arising under the contract.

**Customer service requirements:**  
**After-sales spare parts should be ready at startup:** The spare parts provided by the supplier should be ready at the start of the whole vehicle production.

**Spare Parts Support Cycle:** The support period of after-sales spare parts shall ensure life cycles of the project and requirements in GTC after VINFAST ends production of the whole vehicle, except as specified in this SPB.

**Maintenance Information of After-Sale Spare Parts:** The supplier of the first-level assembly should provide VINFAST after-sales engineering department information about the design, use, and maintenance of the assembly before OTS, such as BOM table, parts structure and function description, fault diagnosis, special tools for maintenance, and relevant technical parameters (installation clearance, parts performance parameters, etc).
