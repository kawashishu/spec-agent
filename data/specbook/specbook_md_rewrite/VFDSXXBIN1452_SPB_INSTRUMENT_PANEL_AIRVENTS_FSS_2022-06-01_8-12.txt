Requirements: During the stiffness- and rigidity testing there must not be any permanent deformations, no breakage, and no customer-relevant modifications.

Most important functions of the Cockpit:
• Optical trim.
• Absorption of noises.
• Absorbing properties in case of head impact.
• Integration of add-on parts.
• Must fulfill all functions over its lifetime.

**Crosscarbeam IP:**
• The cross-car beam (CCB) should be used as the main fixation of the IP.
• Master Reference Point between IP's main carrier and CCB is in Y=0.
• Input regarding the kind of fixation and stiffness defined from SDS IP.
• Technical CCB specifications are defined in the spec book CCB.

**Airbag door:**
The airbag door includes an invisible breakup solution. The lid-carrier is horizontally divided, if possible, symmetrically. If the supplier believes another airbag door solution is better, the supplier must inform, present, and discuss the concept with VinFast.

• The split line must be invisible on the dashboard skin (A-surface). Hinge lines should not leave marks on the skin.
• All break lines of the airbag door must be invisible. They may be produced by cold knife cutting or laser cutting.
• The airbag door must undergo testing at all temperatures, including room temperature (+20°C), low temperature (-30°C), high temperature (+85°C), and all generator load levels (Minimum/Nominal/Maximum load). The tolerance for testing temperatures is ±2.5°C.
• VinFast recommends incorporating an airbag shooting channel on the backside of the IP, potentially created through vibration welding, ultrasonic welding, or infrared welding. An injection-molded dashboard with an integrated shooting channel is also acceptable provided no split line is visible on the A-surface of the dashboard and all technical specifications are met.
• The development goal is to eliminate a separate door for the passenger airbag.
• The integrated airbag door must be firmly attached to the dashboard to prevent any risk of tearing during or after deployment. No injuries caused by the instrument panel or airbag door must be possible during or after a collision.

**Opening Force of the Airbag Door:**
• The opening force must be agreed upon with the airbag supplier and specified in the production drawing. Generally, the maximum opening force should be less than 2.3 kN.
• For the testing program of the airbag door, refer to the safety and restraint system specifications. The validation program for all development phases is detailed in the appendix of the subsystem technical specification for safety and restraint systems.

Functional Responsibility  

**Pyrotechnic Initiator Neutralization:**  
To ensure a cost-effective recycling of end-of-life vehicles, a recycling function (central ability for inflation) shall be provided through the diagnosis interface/central data interface for pyrotechnical components, complying with the following requirements:  
- Enable sequential deployment of all components (avoidance of noise and pressure peaks/check of deployment per component).  
- After deployment of the pyrotechnical components, no solid combustion residues shall remain that could be classified, according to the status of the respectively valid waste legislation, as toxic waste or hazardous substances (otherwise, the components shall be dismantled and disposed of separately as hazardous substances).  
- A successful deployment of pyrotechnical components shall be immediately and clearly visible (acoustically and/or directly at the vehicle/via the feedback at the deployment tool).  
- Marking of positions of pyrotechnical components (especially “hidden” components, e.g., battery safety terminal clamp, active safety headrest).  
- In cases of non-deployment, the removal of pyrotechnical components is required. Pre-dismantling must be avoided, if technically possible (accessibility of fasteners).

**Recycling:**  

**Recycled Materials**  
When selecting materials, attention must focus on reducing the variety of materials and compatibility with available recycling procedures (so-called ‘proven recycling technologies’).  
Secondary raw materials (post-consumer recycles and post-production recycles, e.g., recycled polymeric PET fiber, recycled textiles, recycled foams, recycled thermoplastics, etc.) need to be preferred, based on market availability. Recycled materials must be marked according to parts marking standards defined in this specification book and must be reported to the environmental compliance experts team at VinFast.  

**Recycling Scheme**  
This chapter establishes the general project-wide requirements for the recycling and repair scheme in the development of a component:  
- Design for recycling of parts and components is required to enable cost-effective recycling at end-of-life.  
- The recycling scheme provided by the contractor has to show a simple layout for the possible recycling process of the component, including information about preferred recycling partners and cost estimation.  
- Recycling schemes must be provided to the environmental compliance experts team at VinFast before the milestone PTO Production Try-Out.

**Material Requirements & Corrosion**  

**Corrosion Requirements Interior:**  
- Screws, bolts on Handles, mirror.  
- Key.  
- Seat belts.  
- Trunk area.  
- Seat structure.  
- Invisible structural parts.  
- Vehicle tooling.
Page 26
For determination of corrosion requirements, the corrosivity position needs to be classified for each component in the system:

1. **Corrosivity Low**: 
    Used when the position is not affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

2. **Corrosivity Medium**: 
    Used when the position is at most moderately affected by macro wetness, mud/dirt, or road (deicing) salts.

3. **High corrosivity**: 
    Default for all exterior positions directly affected by road spray.

4. **Very high corrosivity**: 
    Default for all positions directly affected by road spray, stone chipping, and dirt accumulation.

### Corrosion tests:
The parts have to pass system/component tests as well as a complete vehicle corrosion test.

#### Component test for Metallic surfaces:
- **Fog test**: ISO6270 CH, acceptance criteria as defined below.
- **Salt spray test**: ISO9227, acceptance criteria as defined below.

#### For Organic coatings:
- **Cyclic corrosion test (CCT)**: ISO11997 Cycle B, acceptance criteria as defined below.

Alternative tests are possible if proposed by the supplier and accepted by the corrosion engineer.

### Test criteria:

# Corrosion Requirements and Testing on Interior Components

The interior is primarily considered a dry area with low corrosivity. Exceptions may include floor areas or zones prone to wetness or abrasion caused by shoes or spilled drinking juices, which could lead to corrosion.

### Corrosion Prevention Guidelines:
- Different metals should be coated to prevent galvanic corrosion.
- Painted edges must be burr-free to ensure good edge coverage and avoid wear.
- Uncoated seat structure (blank steel): Corrosion-free condition must be met for new parts, especially in areas with visible corrosion risk. Extreme positions of seat-rests should be considered.
- Invisible areas may have relaxed criteria, but visible areas should be free of corrosive products while ensuring full function throughout the vehicle’s lifetime.

### Vehicle Tooling Corrosion Guidelines:
- Tooling, typically stored in the trunk, experiences low corrosivity exposure. However, surfaces prone to wear may encounter medium corrosivity.

# Test Plan Details

### General Test Plan Specifications:
- **Purpose:** Specifies the testing responsibilities, including who performs the tests, the necessary testing devices, and the outcomes displayed visually (progress monitoring).
- **Control:** Tests must be tracked constantly, with all results verified and available for review.

### Testing Verification:
If VinFast chooses to validate test results independently, the SDS must provide parts free of charge.

### Testing Documentation and Approval:
Test procedures and documentation must receive approval from VinFast's corresponding test engineer. Weekly updates to the test plan or immediate supplementation based on development changes are required.

### Testing Responsibility:
The SDS holds full responsibility for ensuring the safeguarding of components, including:
- Timeliness of testing for approvals or re-testing after negative results.
- Submission of all protocols and reports for VinFast verification.

### Testing Costs:
- Improper testing (e.g., using incorrect parts or procedures) necessitates retesting, at the cost of the SDS.
- Retests for negative results will also be financed by SDS if responsibility for the failure lies with them.

• Part variant, description of part.  
• Number of tested components/parts.  

The SDS is responsible for using the draft DVP&R provided by VinFast's testing department. The SDS must initially fill in the data and submit it to VinFast no later than four weeks after nomination.  

The SDS has to plan a DVP for each development stage, prototype (if defined in the master timing chart), and serial stage.  

The sequence of testing and the number of test specimens must be determined in cooperation with the validation engineer and component lead engineer at VinFast. The test plan is to be coordinated and jointly approved by the responsible VinFast departments and the SDS.  

The DVP&R has to be agreed upon between the test department, VinFast SQA, and the SDS before concept confirmation (milestone CC). After this milestone, the DVP&R must be reviewed weekly. In case of scheduling delays, the SDS must submit proposals to fulfill the committed schedule.  

Upon request, the SDS draws up a test plan for each individual component.  

### Testing  
#### General  
The SDS must prepare a detailed, backdated testing plan, aligned with the vehicle timing chart (see Chapter 4.17).  

It must be guaranteed that the worst-case component/system variant will be tested.  

To prevent redundant testing, mechanical and electrical tests should be combined as far as possible.  

Development parts or partial body structures required for testing at the SDS must be stated in the SDS quotation and ordered from VinFast.  

Unless otherwise agreed, a measurement report for each sample part must accompany deliveries.  

Parts required for testing activities at VinFast’s test department must be provided free of charge by the SDS.  

The SDS must comply with all relevant legislation for its component and ensure that all internal VFDST requirements specified in the performance specification are met.  

All test results must be documented with photos in the test reports and shared with VinFast.  

The SDS must ensure that all relevant Vietnamese legal obligations are fulfilled.  

All tests must be documented as per VF standards or SDS standards if approved by VinFast.  

The SDS must evaluate and perform the tests required for the serial development phase as specified.  

The tests must be incorporated into the attached DVP&R template found in the offer.  

Samples for inspections must be provided on time or by the agreed dates (coordinated with the test department).
Page 29
Even manual samples can provide sufficient information in certain cases. Measures can thus be introduced in time in the event of assembly problems in order to ensure the installability of the test parts.

VINFAST "Logistics" determines the number of sample parts, while VinFast "Purchase" orders the parts. A measurement report for each sample part must be enclosed in the delivery. The SDS must submit positive disassembly/inspection reports of the latest build level and test reports of all required tests according to DVP&R. The disassembly and inspections must be carried out by the SDS. 

CAD data models in compliance with VinFast requirements must be provided in time for virtual sample manufacturing.  
Marking of sample parts must follow VF Standard VFDST00008700 [41].  
Preparation of measurement reports must adhere to VF Standard VFDST00008900 [43].  
Reference point systems must comply with VF Standard VFDST00000011 [28].

### Release by Test-departments
The responsible VinFast test department will release the components only if the agreed test targets are achieved by the SDS and during the complete vehicle integration tests. The SDS must submit positive test reports for all required tests according to DVP&R. In case of any problems (negative test results, wrong parameters/processes, etc.), the SDS must submit a test report, be present upon request, and deliver proposals for solutions to meet all milestones and observe all targets.

**OK or NOK results must be stated on the first sheet of the report.**

### Analyses and Test Reports
The SDS must provide measurement reports according to VF Standard VFDST00008900 [43] in electronic format with agreed alignments and measurement concepts for all parts during prototype generations. After completing individual tests, all test samples must be analyzed in detail.

The measurement and test results must be proven using individual values and documented in a test report. This report must be handed over to the appropriate VinFast department for release. Upon request, the results, along with the documentation of tests carried out during development (initial sample inspections and parallel tests), must be submitted to the relevant specialist department for approval. Tests carried out parallel to series production must be planned and documented regularly or as required.

### Test Report Information
- A description or picture of the part, including documentation (part number, change index, materials, production process, additives such as grease, and any deviations from the approved serial process).
- All parts must be labeled with a description.
- If negative test results occur, include reasons for testing and attach previous test reports.
- Clearly name the testing standard, norm, legal requirement, or provide an exact description of the agreed testing procedure.

### Documentation of Results
- All documentation must align with VF standards and include the necessary notes for complete traceability of the testing and approval processes.
Page 30
**Progress of testing status:**  
Listing of all tests in a table with responsible person, part status, comparison of target date and due date. In case of negative test results, the supplier must provide a new date for retest along with countermeasures for VinFast approval, with the responsible person and company to conduct the test.  

The VinFast test engineer must be periodically informed of the actual status and progress. If VinFast orders parts for testing on their own, the detailed description of the parts must also be attached.  

**Archival storage of tested parts:**  
Testing parts can only be scrapped with the explicit agreement of the VinFast test department. Upon request from the test engineer, all testing documentation—including reports, parts, and descriptions—must be presented.  

**BIW-supports, testing devices, and equipment:**  
The number and configuration must align with the VinFast test department. BIW supports are provided by VinFast for the duration of testing.  

The number and structures for testing (e.g., vibration testing devices, environmental testing devices, and long-term run structures) must align with VinFast test department specifications. Proof that all equipment for testing meets the corresponding testing instruction must be provided by the SDS.  

At minimum, the following details must be documented for all test samples and included in testing reports:  
- Drawing Number  
- Part Number  
- Release Number  
- Change Index  
- Production and Delivery Date  
- Documentation and designation according to VFDST00008700 [41]  
- Documentation of tool revision state  
- Measurement Report  
- DSR Development Sample Report VFDST00008800 [42]  

**Virtual testing:**
