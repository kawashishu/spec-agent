3 Additional Technical or Functional descriptions.  

This specification is related to the electric compressor EM34A1 of SHANGHAI BENLING SCROLL COMPRESSOR CO., LTD. This Electric Compressor is used for refrigerant compression on vehicle A/C system and controls speed of internal motor based on LIN signal input, and outputs the information of drive current, motor speed and result of self-diagnosis on LIN bus.  

**Compressor part:**  
The function is to compress a refrigerant, and a refrigerant flows from suction port to discharge port. The compression mechanism is scroll type and driven by the electric motor.  

**Electric motor:**  
The function is to drive the compression mechanism. Type is brush-less DC. Three-phase electric power is delivered by the inverter.  

**Inverter:**  
The function is to drive the motor according to vehicle requirements. Electric power comes from HV connector as DC, and the inverter changes to three-phase AC with sensor-less motor control method. Vehicle requirements, the compressor operating status, and the inverter diagnostic information go through the LV connector via LIN communication.

System Performance:

**Cooling Capacity and Power Consumption (R134a).**

The cooling performance curve illustrates the relationship between refrigeration capacity, input power, and COP (Coefficient of Performance). Key observations include:

- Refrigeration capacity increases steadily up to 8000W on the curve.
- COP starts at a lower value and gradually rises up to approximately 3.5.
- Input power exhibits steady behavior at around 8000W across operational ranges.

The graph provides visual insights into the energy efficiency and performance characteristics of the HV Compressor under varying input conditions when using R134a refrigerant.
