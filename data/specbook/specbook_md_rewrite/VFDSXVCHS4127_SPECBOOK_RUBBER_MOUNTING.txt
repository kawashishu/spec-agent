**2.1 CAD Data/ Transfer data-CAD Requirements.**  
All CAD data must be designed with CATIA V5 following VF standard VFDST00000014.  
CAD data transfer from VinFast to the supplier will be done through the Supplier collaborative module. For more details, refer to the Supplier collaborative module in the RFQ package.  

**2.2 Change Documentation and Part History Documentation.**  
During the development and production process, all the history of changes within the framework of the contractor have to be documented and provided to VinFast. The form of the data can be defined by the contractor.  

Vehicle Documentation Systems or components that must fulfill safety regulations of authorities or legal requirements have to be remarked on the drawings.  
The reasons and the characteristics which must be documented are listed by authorities.  

These demands will be requested during the development of the part and at the latest in the PTO phase.
